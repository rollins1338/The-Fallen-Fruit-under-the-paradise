Chapter 51.

“Ung… umm…”

 

Ulrich sighed as he watched her still clumsily pressing her lips against his, unable to do anything but rub insistently.

 

Through the wide-open door, Lisbell’s moist tongue cautiously pushed in as if testing the waters. Enjoying the sensation of her tongue scraping against his teeth, Ulrich quietly lowered his arms and lifted her neat skirt that fell to her knees.

 

As he touched her prominent kneecap and trailed his hand up her slender thigh, Lisbell immediately responded.

 

Her skin twitched as if sparks were flying, but she did not resist much. She merely occasionally curled her tongue inside her mouth and exhaled hot breaths that seemed almost scorching.

 

Still tipsy, Ulrich felt as if he was drinking along with her and savored it sweetly.

 

“Theo, I’m sorry…”

 
 

“I’m sorry, so don’t go… Huh, yeah…?”

 

Just as he started to feel her pleasantly licking the inside of his cheek, Lisbell suddenly clung to his clothes and pleaded. It was obvious that her trembling eyes behind tightly shut eyelids resembled a trapped herbivore.

 

“Where am I going?”

 

“Don’t go… I, uh, I lied…”

 

“What lie?”

 

“I said I, uh… don’t love you anymore.”

 



 

“But actually, the truth is, I still…”

 

“Do you love me?”

 

“Do you love me?”

 

Lisbell slowly opened her eyes towards the deep darkness.

 

Her trembling hand clutched his coat, recognizing him only by his silhouette. Ulrich gazed down at her under the same circumstances.

 

The only difference was that her vision was blurred by drunkenness, whereas he was sober.

 

Ulrich wondered if she might sober up now. If she did, he was curious about how she would react.

 

Probably, her face would turn pale, and she would push him away in disgust, treating him like a germ, crawling away from him even if it meant crawling on all fours.

 

Watching her react like that, he thought it wouldn’t be bad to strip her skirt and immediately thrust into her. If he thrust deeply, spanking her buttocks while hitting her most sensitive spots, she would squirm and spill clear fluid like urine.

 

Her face and other features would turn as red as her heated hole from the thrusting, bringing out her most erotic side. This too seemed not a bad idea.

 

“I love you…”

 



 

“This too, this too is sincere…”

 

Her weak voice, which had been trailing off like a loose thread, was now quite clear.

 

Ulrich looked down at her innocent face, pouring out a heartfelt confession to the wrong person.

 

The kiss resumed urgently. This time, it was Ulrich who initiated it.

 

Lisbell, seemingly startled by his uncharacteristic boldness, soon sweetly accepted his intruding tongue like a piece of sugar.

 

Wet sounds leaked from the slightly parted and then rejoined lips. The mingling saliva loudly testified to how lustfully the two small pieces of flesh were rubbing against each other.

 

“Lift your hips.”

 

Ulrich, nibbling on her tongue, murmured as he pushed his arm towards her buttocks. Lisbell, exhaling roughly, cautiously complied with the command. While doing so, she carefully grasped his dark arm.

 

“Why, but, huh…?”

 



 

“Your way of speaking, uh, since a while ago…?”

 

Ulrich, who had been removing her lower garments with quiet efficiency, raised his eyebrows slightly.

 

“Way of speaking?”

 

“You don’t usually use formal speech… but you keep…”

 

It seemed she was caught on an irrelevant point. Even amidst this, her inability to sober up was indeed remarkable.

 

She had said before that she was quite weak to alcohol. The whiskey stocked in the villa was strong enough to make even heavy drinkers like him feel lightheaded, so it must have easily pushed her to the brink of unconsciousness.

 

As a result, even now, rubbing her lower abdomen obscenely, she accepted it without any resistance.

 

“Should I stop?”

 

Ulrich asked as he stroked her soft pubic hair hidden in her underwear.

 

Lisbell frowned slightly but soon returned to her dazed state.

 

“Yeah…”

 

“Why?”

 

“Because it keeps, keeps reminding me.”

 

“Reminding you of what?”

 

“Of someone I don’t like…”

 



 

“That man keeps…”

 

He couldn’t help but laugh in disbelief.

 

She had no idea that she was rubbing bodies with the very person she claimed to dislike, right before intercourse. If she knew, she wouldn’t be tangled up like this in the dim bedroom.

 

Suppressing a reflexive laugh, Ulrich whispered, “That’s too much.”

 

“…Yeah?”

 

“Then, if you don’t like it…”

 

Ulrich’s hand slowly withdrew from her lower body, where he had made room for entry. His elegantly outlined hand grabbed his own trousers. The act of unbuttoning in the dark was vivid enough to stir tension.

 

He licked his dry lips and left a brief kiss on the corner of Lisbell’s mouth.

 

“Then I’ll just thrust it in.”

 

His trousers were fully undone. With one gesture, he pulled out his stiff, engorged erect!on. The reddish, swollen head of his cock threatened as it bobbed against his firm abs.

 

As he grasped the blunt tip and rubbed it, pre-cum had already started to trickle down. From the moment she started her misguided declaration of love, he had been aching down there.

 

“Umm… ung.”

 

Suppressing the softly struggling Lisbell with his body, he pressed their lips together again. Every time he softly licked her alternating lips, her belly button trembled.

 

Ulrich spread her legs a bit more and removed her skirt and underwear, revealing her wet vulva. He pressed his cock against her smooth entrance and rubbed it.

 

“Haa…”

 

“Ugh… yeah… ah…”

 

Instead of immediately penetrating, he rubbed the soft entrance. As his veined surface stimulated her, Lisbell twisted her waist and moaned.

 

Ulrich grabbed her wriggling buttocks, deepening the intimate contact between their gen!talia. As he raised her arousal, her flesh softened, and she began to show moistness.

 

Meanwhile, his lips were not idle either. He persistently found and sucked her tongue that kept trying to hide, stealing her breath in an obscene manner.

 

Ulrich felt as if he was getting drunk himself.

 

The more he plunged his tongue into her mouth and stole her sticky breath and saliva, the more his rational mind was overlaid with hazy heat.

 

“Haa, haa.”

 

Moaning and writhing, Lisbell did not resist. She might truly believe tonight is her first night with her fiancé.

 

Ulrich chuckled darkly.

 

Knowing that he was about to take both her real and fake first night, he already pictured her reaction when she found out later.

 

Would she cry, get angry, feel desolate, or despair? The various possibilities were already a delightful plaything.

 

“Hoo…”

 

Even so, he sighed deeply.

 

The tantalizing play was reaching its limit.


After several sessions of !ntercourse, the opening widened without much resistance, despite the gentle pressure pushing in. It had only been pressed a few times between the tender flesh, but already his entire shaft was sticky with fluids.

 

Now it was time to thoroughly beat it with his arm, swollen to the size of a forearm.

 

“Ugh…!”

 

Startled, Lisbell grabbed the sheets tightly with both hands and squeezed her buttocks as Ulrich suddenly flipped her over.

 

Ulrich pulled her lower body closer, making it stick tightly. Then, he naturally took a position from behind, spreading her buttocks apart. He saw the wet hole below the tender flesh, sticking to his palm, glistening with moisture.

 

Before entering, he stretched it from side to side. Over time, the previously tight contraction had eased a bit, and the previously soft color had darkened slightly.

 

It was a satisfying change.

 

As he wondered if this would one day become stained like a mark he personally left, Ulrich thrust his wet center inside all at once.

 

“…Ah…!”

 

Despite being soaked, it was quite a struggle to push it all the way to the base.

 

Ulrich pushed deep into the tight inner walls with pure strength. The inner walls, forcibly opened, trembled with slight spasms.

 

Then, he adjusted to the rounded buttocks, thrusting rhythmically, causing the inside to tremble wildly.

 

“Ah, ah, ah…!”

 

Lisbell instinctively swayed her hips, rubbing her forehead against the sheet. It was uncharacteristic of her.

 

Perhaps she was mistaken in thinking that the one penetrating her was her fiancé, but being intoxicated itself was likely bringing unexpected exhilaration. Good sex even when sober can be enhanced with the addition of alcohol or drugs.

 

There was no need to make her turn her face this way to confirm. Not only her lewd appearance but the change in the inner flesh as it received him indicated that she was willing.

 

Today, after only a bit of initial resistance, the rhythmical piston movement was not difficult at all.

 

Her insides tightened perfectly, squeezing the flesh pleasingly with every thrust. Ulrich held her pale buttocks in both hands, fingers gripping tightly, and rapidly bounced his hips.

 

“Wait, just a moment…!”

 

The act was paused briefly.

 

Lisbell, gripping the sheet like a lifeline, reached back to hold Ulrich. Or rather, it was more of a pushing motion than a grasping one.

 

Ulrich stared blankly at the long, slender fingers resting on him. For a brief moment, he felt a violent impulse to break each finger that was hindering this rapid pleasure.

 

“I don’t like this, Theo…”

 

“You don’t like it?”

 

No way.

 

Ulrich, with a sneer, slammed his pen!s deep, making a loud noise, as if questioning how she could say she didn’t like it when she was greedily sucking it in. Lisbell flailed like a fish out of water.

 

“Ah! This position, I hate it! Please…!”

 

Ulrich’s powerful thrusts paused.

 

Even in this situation, Lisbell, unable to control her limbs due to the overwhelming pleasure, collapsed forward with a wet voice.

 

“It reminds me of him. I hate this position…”

 



 

“I don’t want to think of him while I’m with you…”

 



 

“So, please… please…”

 

In short, she was asking him to stop using the position that reminded her of intercourse with him, not to stop the sex altogether.

 

Ulrich, initially unresponsive, let out a quiet laugh.

 

With eyes that were hot yet cold, like ice within flames, he looked down at her thin back and flipped her over to a straight position, grabbing her knees.

 

Following her trembling body, the loosely tied necktie fluttered. He grabbed it, pulling her neck slightly towards him.

 

“Is this what you want?”

 

Without knowing who she was with, she was making demands like this.

 

Even as he thought this, Ulrich complied with Lisbell’s request. It was a small pleasure saved for later. For now, she only associated certain positions with him, but eventually, she would think of him regardless of the position, marking her deeply.

 

“Is this good?”

 

“Yes, ugh, ah…!”

 

“Do you like it, facing me like this?”

 

Resuming the rhythmic thrusts in the new position, Lisbell’s face flushed deeper red, moving aimlessly.

 

So stupid.

 

Despite his mocking thoughts, Ulrich felt an uncontrollable heat rising.

 

He grabbed her behind the knees, lifting her lower body and thrusting upwards. The thin, wet pubic hair stuck annoyingly to both her crotch and his groin, adding to the irritating sensation.

 

“Do you like it? Huh?”

 

“Ah, ah…!”

 

“Answer, Lisbell.”

 

“Yes, I like it… Ah…!”

 

“Then say you love me again.”

 

“Uh, ah, ah…!”

 

“Say it again. Come on…”

 

Slowing his thrusts deliberately, he urged her. Lisbell clung to him more tightly, embracing him with her whole body.

 

Lightly kissing her nose and flushed cheeks, he prompted her again, and Lisbell, perhaps mistaking his tender manner for that of her fiancé, whimpered.

 

“I love you, Theo. I love you…”

 

Ulrich couldn’t suppress a laughter bubbling up from his core. He kissed her tongue, wrapping it around his own, then whispered softly in her ear.

 

“But I’m not Theo.”

 

“Uh…? Uh?”

 

“Do you still love me?”

 

Lisbell panted heavily. He increased his pace as soon as he threw out the unsettling question. Penetrating deeply into the wet hole, Lisbell clung to him, her body convulsing.

 

Even as she was overwhelmed by pleasure, her eyes darted upward, unable to ignore his strange words.

 

Ulrich covered her eyes with his hand and continued thrusting into the soft, concave spot inside. His heavy, tight scrotum was already pulling taut. Today’s sex was strangely enjoyable, and the urge to climax was approaching faster than usual.

 

“Theo… Theo…?”

 

“Yes, I’m here.”

 

“Theo… ugh, ah…!”

 

“I’m here, Lisbell…”

 

Giggling, he teased her with exaggerated affection.

 

Toying with her deliberately, he focused all his energy on thrusting, as if to completely dominate her. Holding her slender waist, he pushed her up strongly.

 

Lisbell felt it acutely every time he grazed towards her navel. She particularly enjoyed it when he targeted that area from behind.

 

“Ah, Theo! Theo!”

 

“Is it good with Theo, huh? Does your fiancé’s dick feel that different?”

 

Under normal circumstances, she would have felt something was off, but unfortunately, Lisbell was too far gone to notice. With her mind muddled by potent intoxication and the burning heat inside her, she couldn’t harbor any doubts and clung to him.

 

Through the blurry, swaying vision, she saw only darkness.

 

Whatever form it took, in her sorrow-stricken eyes after losing her fiancé, it was perceived only as Theodore returning to her.


“Theo, Theo, ah, just a little more… uh, ah, ah!”

 

The rapid and forceful invasion at the entrance quickened. Lisbell became like a nail being hammered, her body trembling as she curled inward. Ulrich persistently pushed into her and whispered in her ear.

 

“Can I do it inside?”

 

“Uh, huff, huh…? Ah! Ah…!”

 

“Lisbell, inside you… ha….”

 

“Huff, ah….”

 

“We’re going to get married anyway, right?”

 

He asked in a tone so gentle and desperate that Lisbell, caught off guard, nodded while clinging to his neck.

 

Ulrich’s smile, caught at the corners of his lips, darkened like a shadow in a shaded corner.

 

“You gave me permission.”

 

Ulrich, who held her ankles apart and aligned below, thrust passionately. Lisbell, unable to even swallow her saliva, rubbed the back of her head against the sheet, crying out.

 

The squelching sound continued between their hips.

 

The inside, which had loosened up, clung to the shaft as if pleading not to let go, then barely returned to its place, repeating this pattern. Each time the intense coupling that felt like it would pull her insides out continued, wet traces spurted everywhere.

 

“Ah, ah, aaah…! Uh-huh!”

 

Lost in the sensuality squeezing her entire body, Lisbell reached the pinnacle that struck her brain sharply. The woman’s piercing moans, which had been quite sharp, gradually faded and then died away.

 

Meanwhile, Ulrich wrapped the tie around her neck in his hand and pulled.

 

Kissing her deeply, he accelerated to the final speed.

 

Pressing firmly against her thigh, already marked by light abrasions from the constant contact, he forcefully thrust his glans up to her cervix.

 

“Hmm…!”

 

As the act subsided, Lisbell, unable to swallow her saliva, wandered the air with unfocused pupils, reaching another climax. Ulrich, watching her messy appearance, ejaculated.

 

As she had wished, his body shook with satisfaction, and Lisbell’s convulsions, nearly at the level of shivering, subsided. Her arms and legs also lost all strength.

 

Now, completely limp, she breathed softly, as if finally falling into a sleep she could not escape.

 

Her gray hair, disheveled, covered the side of her face. Watching this, Ulrich leaned forward. He finally took a mouthful of her fluttering hair, sucking it gently like he had with her lips earlier, then slowly let it go.

 

“Hmm.”

 

It wasn’t particularly tasty. The texture was what he enjoyed. Earlier, it had clung to his fingers, and now it clung to his tongue, the unfamiliar sensation feeling fresh. It seemed he could chew it playfully whenever he was bored.

 

But Ulrich thought of something else.

 

Letting go of the hair, his lips naturally moved to bite Lisbell’s lips.

 

Already asleep, her lips parted easily with the slightest touch. The willingness and innocence, still recognizing him as her fiancé, were both gratifying and annoying.

 

Suppressing a chuckle, he filled her mouth with his tongue. Biting her swollen lips until they puffed up, he slowly withdrew. Grabbing her limp legs, he hoisted them over his shoulder, realigning their connection.

 

The smell of alcohol lingering in the air was almost gone. Ulrich’s nerves, now fully alert, could only detect Lisbell’s body scent. Perhaps it was because of the hair he had just chewed.

 

Accepting it gladly, he adjusted his posture. He then carefully undressed her one by one.

 

He didn’t bother to remove the tie around her naked body.

 

Whenever he felt unsatisfied, he would pull and loosen the tie in his hand.

 

Even in her sleep, Lisbell occasionally coughed lightly, feeling the physical pressure. Each time, he would smile sweetly and quicken his pace a little more.

 



 

She had developed a habit of waking up, counting the hours of the night, not knowing when she had fallen asleep. It was always like this in the morning.

 

Lisbell, lying on her side, quietly rolled her half-open eyes.

 

When did I come back to this room?

 

As she wandered through these thoughts, fragmented memories floated to the surface. And when those memories finally turned into the image of Theodore crying with his head on her lap, Lisbell held her breath.

 



 

That’s right.

 

Yesterday, Lisbell had notified her fiancé of their breakup. It was truly a unilateral and disgraceful manner. After that, she had guarded her mother’s sickbed, unable to bear it any longer, and intended to return to her room. During this process, through the crack of an accidentally opened door….

 

Ah, alcohol.

 

She remembered coming back to this bedroom and drinking directly from the bottle without a glass. No wonder her head had been splitting with pain.

 

What’s this… a tie?

 

She noticed several things in succession. A tie draped over her completely naked body, and a man’s arm resting across her waist.

 

She became aware of the soft breathing against her back.

 

When did this man arrive?

 

There was no memory of Ulrich in the last scene she remembered. She had been drinking alone in this bed. Though she didn’t know what had happened, her entire body felt achy as if she had been tossed around.

 

Lisbell let out a small groan and twisted her body, only to freeze. Goosebumps ran up her stiffened back.

 

It’s still… inside.

 

As soon as she moved her lower body slightly, it felt sticky between her buttocks. Once conscious of it, the foreign sensation became overwhelmingly uncomfortable. The reason for the unusually tight position was clear. Ulrich’s member was still inside her.

 

Revulsion and fear simultaneously washed over her. The thought that she might have been like this all night made her feel sick, and the physical strain of being spread out for so long scared her.

 

Lisbell bit her lip hard enough to draw blood and cautiously lifted her upper body. She slowly moved forward.

 

“Huff….”

 

Despite her efforts to stay silent, a faint moan escaped. The heavy flesh slid out slowly, laden with the foam that had built up overnight. The empty space inside her throbbed and ached from the prolonged friction. Dampness oozed out. Startled, Lisbell quickly wiped between her legs with her palm.

 



 

Her hand was smeared with a sticky liquid, resembling a mix of milk and oil. Lisbell stared down at the evidence, bewildered.

 

“Mm.”

 

Just then, the man beside her stirred, unknowingly draping his arm over his forehead. Ulrich, yawning and still half-asleep, opened his pale eyelashes.

 

He reached out to Lisbell, who was sitting there staring at her hand in disbelief, and lightly touched the long tie hanging diagonally down her body. She jolted awake and turned her head.

 

“Why… are you here?”

 

“Don’t you remember?”

 



 

“Of course not. You drank an entire bottle.”

 

He added that it was stronger than she had thought, then slowly sat up.

 

His eyes, usually docile, looked even more droopy with lingering sleepiness. He yawned again and ruffled his messy platinum hair. Lisbell, staring blankly at his face, spoke.

 

“Clearly….”

 

“Hmm?”

 

“Clearly, we agreed not to….”

 

Mentioning the contract clause prohibiting internal ejaculation, Ulrich, realizing the source of the traces, let out a lazy laugh.

 

Propping himself up with a cushion, he started to look for a cigarette, then remembered this was her bedroom and stopped.

 

“You gave me permission, Lisbell. You said I could do it inside.”

 



 

“Ah, you probably don’t remember that either.”

 

He removed the blanket covering his lower body and got out of bed. Stretching leisurely, he ignored the crumpled shirt and put on his pants. As he buckled up, he noticed her still staring at her palm helplessly and chuckled.

 

“And it doesn’t matter anymore, does it?”

 



 

“I saw yesterday that you’re completely done with Mr. Motier.”


Those words struck a nerve with Lisbell, who had been struggling to regain her composure. She lowered her hand, which she had been keeping suspended awkwardly, and wiped it on the blanket. Though the marks disappeared quickly, she still felt uneasy, as if something muddy was clinging to her.

 

Moreover, the inexplicable tie around her neck was another source of discomfort. It was definitely “his” tie. Lisbell was about to impatiently remove it when he spoke.

 

“Were you the one who wanted to break off the engagement first?”

 



 

“Or did you suggest it?”

 

“It’s unrelated to this.”

 



 

“I hope this kind of thing doesn’t happen again.”

 

“Why?”

 



 

“Afraid you might get pregnant?”

 

Lisbell refrained from answering and stood up. With a lingering hangover and the recent breakup with Theodore still fresh, she had no energy to deal with the man in front of her. She just wanted to rush into the bathroom and wash off her tainted body.

 

As Ulrich approached the curtained window, he spoke to her retreating back.

 

“Wash up and come down to the dining room. Let’s eat together.”

 

“…I’m not in the mood.”

 

“Come down anyway.”

 

“I said I’m not in the mood.”

 

“Do I seem like I’m making a suggestion?”

 

Lisbell bit her lip hard.

 

Walking along the window, he methodically drew back the curtains. The room, which had been dark the previous night, was now flooded with light. Despite the bright scene, Lisbell seemed about to collapse, while the man stood comfortably, basking in the morning sunlight, and spoke cheerfully.

 

“I have something to tell you.”

 

“Then tell me here….”

 

“While we eat. Lisbell, you’ll feel worse if you stay on an empty stomach after drinking so much last night. You need to eat something.”

 

She knew well enough that his occasional kindness was just a facade. Lisbell no longer fell for it.

 



 

“If you really don’t want to… I’ll just have to visit that bedroom where your mother is lying down. You’re always there, after all.”

 

Lisbell’s face hardened with rejection. Smiling flawlessly, Ulrich picked up the tie from the bed. Only after clutching it did he leave the room as if his business was finished.

 

Lisbell immediately headed to the bathroom and turned on the faucet. The water cascaded over her body, washing every corner.

 

But she didn’t feel cleansed. Instead, she felt more suffocated. Standing under the hot water until her skin was thoroughly warmed, she finally stepped out after a long while.

 

After washing, she checked the clock on the table.

 

Her headache persisted, and her stomach felt uneasy. She wanted nothing more than to collapse onto the bed and sleep. But she couldn’t do that without knowing what he meant by having something to say.

 

If it concerned her mother, avoiding it was pointless. Besides, he said he’d come to her mother’s bedroom if she didn’t go….

 

Suppressing a groan, Lisbell rummaged through the closet.

 

Half of it was filled with thin slips Ulrich had his secretary stock without her consent. Pushing them aside disdainfully, she selected a clean outfit. It was just her usual neat blouse and a long flare skirt that covered her legs.

 

She considered tying her damp hair, but feeling too lazy, she left the bedroom.

 

As she entered the dining room, the rich aroma of warm soup filled the air. Ulrich approached and set a pre-served bowl of soup before her as she sat down.

 

He too seemed to have washed, with his hair slightly damp, and wore a light gown suitable for indoors. Lisbell glanced at the steaming soup, then watched him pick up his fork.

 

“What is it you need to say?”

 

“Just eat first.”

 

“Tell me, and I’ll eat.”

 

“Do I need to feed you directly?”

 



 

“Are you a baby?”

 

Annoyed by his words, Lisbell picked up the spoon. She didn’t want to give in, but his taunts were grating. If she kept resisting, he might really grab her and force the hot soup into her mouth.

 

The mere thought exhausted her, so she reluctantly took a spoonful of the soup. It was fortunately palatable. She’d noted before how surprisingly good the food was, considering it was for someone like him.

 

“I need to visit the capital in a few days.”

 

He finally got to the point as she started eating. Lisbell’s hand paused. She looked up quickly. Ulrich met her unexpected gaze as he lit a cigarette.

 

“I have an unmissable appointment.”

 



 

“Your mother’s treatment will continue as usual. Nothing will change except my absence. But I thought you should know.”

 

“When will you be back?”

 

“Why are you curious?”

 



 

“Planning to run away?”

 

Lisbell’s grip on the spoon tightened. Her gaze dropped.

 

“How could I run away?”

 



 

“Mother hasn’t regained consciousness.”

 

“If you really wanted to, you could.”

 



 

“Though, I suppose there’s no need to try so hard now. You’re completely done with Mr. Motier.”

 

The soup that had been manageable moments ago now felt nauseating. Every time Ulrich intentionally brought up Theodore, it made her feel sick. It was like her Achilles’ heel was being cruelly exposed.

 

“Is that all you needed to say?”

 

She put down the spoon with a clatter and stood up, only to be yanked back into the chair by her arm. The grip was so strong it hurt, and Lisbell frowned in pain.

 

“Do you really not remember anything from last night?”

 

“…Ugh.”

 

“You melted my heart completely.”

 

Seeing Lisbell’s pained face, he slowly released her arm and gently rubbed the spot. As he exhaled cigarette smoke, he murmured.

 

“Did you know you told me you loved me last night?”

 

Lisbell’s eyes widened in disbelief.

 

“You said it several times.”

 



 

“Several times….”

 

His lazy voice spread through the smoke, as if savoring the memory.

 

Lisbell realized his malicious intent to force her to recall a night she didn’t want to remember, which she couldn’t recall anyway.

 

“…Didn’t you learn that taking advantage of a drunk person is unworthy of a gentleman?”

 

Ulrich’s eyes slowly returned to her. His gaze, intense and fiery, couldn’t be ignored. Lisbell instinctively drew her knees together.

 

“You grabbed me first.”

 



 

“You clung to me, crying and begging me not to leave.”

 



 

“Ah, didn’t I mention? I’m weak against your crying face.”

 

Both possibilities existed.

 

He could be lying to mess with her, or she could have really clung to him in her drunken state. If only her memory were clear, she would know instantly, but the events of last night were a blank. The more she tried to recall, the worse her headache got. It was a severe hangover.

 

“Even if I did… You should have ignored it as drunken behavior.”

 

“You kissed me first, you know. Don’t you remember?”

 

“You should have just left me alone and walked out.”

 

“You kissed me several times. You even used your tongue first.”

 



 

“Hugging my neck… begging me not to leave while wrapping your legs around my waist.”

 

She couldn’t listen any longer.

 

“I didn’t think it was you!” Lisbell gasped, her eyes filled with resentment.


Even if what he said was true, nothing would change.

 

It was probably because she was drunk and mistook him for Theodore that she acted so disgracefully.

 

Last night, the man who pretended to be her fiancé in the cover of pitch-black darkness was none other than Ulrich Altahart. Now, just the thought of him made her feel repulsed, someone she could never have good feelings for. No matter what, that wouldn’t change.

 

“If it were you.”

 



 

“If I knew it was you, I never would have….”

 

She wouldn’t have done it.

 

The words choked with sobs were swallowed down and never came out.

 

It was truly a cursed night.

 

No matter how hard she tried to ignore it, her constant recollections of last night kept making her think of Theodore.

 

After telling him the lie that she no longer loved him and announcing the breakup, she couldn’t console him as he cried on her lap, cowardly standing by as he wept. She just sat there, watching as he completely left, feeling like she was hanging herself in this prison-like villa.

 

It was a sort of torture, constantly being reminded that the future she had tried so hard to protect was shattered to pieces.

 

Lisbell wiped away the tears running down her cheeks. From the other side, she heard the sound of someone clicking their tongue.

 

“Change your mind a little.”

 



 

“Now that you no longer have a fiancé to feel guilty about, you don’t need to be so distressed. Last night, Lisbell, you felt good enough holding onto me. Honestly, it felt good, didn’t it? You cried and climaxed so many times with me….”

 



 

“If your fiancé is gone, shouldn’t you be able to enjoy yourself a bit more?”

 

Lisbell felt dizzy.

 

His words were really hard to understand. Did he think that the reason she found this relationship difficult was simply because of guilt towards her fiancé?

 

Close, but not entirely correct.

 

Ulrich viewed relationships between people too simplistically and superficially. He didn’t consider the inner depths, only the external factors, defining cause and effect based on that alone.

 

Lisbell realized this after a moment.

 

“You…”

 

Her voice was dry and sounded like metal.

 

She looked out the window. The sky, which had been clear for several days, seemed a bit dimmer. The green leaves on the branches were slightly discolored at the edges.

 

Late summer was ending.

 

It was a sign that cool autumn was coming.

 

“You’ve never loved anyone, have you?”

 



 

“That’s why you can say things like that….”

 

There was a time when she hoped that everything might end after summer passed. Standing in front of the autumn that had finally arrived, she realized how futile that hope was.

 

Her mother was still the same, and the future she dreamed of with Theodore had completely crumbled.

 

So, what was she doing here now?

 

“Love?”

 

Ulrich stood up.

 

He grabbed Lisbell’s arm, who was staring off into the distance. Her slender body was forcibly pulled up and pushed onto the dining table. Ulrich pushed away the soup bowl that was barely touched. The sound of the chair falling and the bowl shattering on the floor mixed together messily. Her hearing seemed to fail her as everything crumbled.

 

“Why bother with something so childish and tiring?”

 

Ulrich flipped her flare skirt up. Feeling her underwear being pulled down to her ankles in an instant, Lisbell bit her lip. Her buttocks, bruised from his grasp last night, were spread apart.

 

“Like this.”

 

He undid the cord roughly tied around his waist and pulled out his erect!on, rubbing it against Lisbell’s dry vulva.

 

The foreplay was short. As if to vent his displeasure, he thrust into her dry vag!na.

 

“…Ah…!”

 

“There’s a hole you can spread whenever you want… ha, anyway.”

 

A deep breath escaped his lips. Lisbell tightened her lower abdomen. Despite feeling a distinctly different pressure from last night, Ulrich persistently moved his hips.

 

“Ah, ah, uh…. “

 

From the woman underneath him came dry moans, different from the sweet ones of the night before.

 

Even so, once a body was accustomed to pleasure, it couldn’t easily forget that overwhelming sensation. As he scraped inside her with his engorged shaft, her inner walls reluctantly released moisture reflexively.

 

Ulrich continued his increasingly slick thrusts, raising his eyes.

 

Her hair, not tied up, covered her face again. He brushed it away, tucking it behind her ear. Her delicate profile was revealed. Ulrich stared intensely at her vacant, purple eyes and thrusted deeply, smiling lazily.

 

“Ah, as I thought.”

 

“Ugh, ah…”

 

“You’re the prettiest when you cry and moan absentmindedly.”

 

Lisbell gripped the tablecloth tightly.

 

His words, meant to shatter her pride, made her feel resigned rather than angry. Reality still coldly surrounded her. No matter what feelings she had towards this man, she couldn’t escape this situation.

 

Even if one side’s love was broken, as long as the other side’s love remained….

 

Unless she found a perfect way to take her mother out of his grasp, there was no other choice.

 

With every passionate thrust from behind, her vision shook. It felt like she was being plunged to the bottom of the sea. Perhaps it was the pressure on her chest making it hard to breathe.

 

Lisbell, staring weakly to the side, slowly closed her eyes.

 

What am I….

 

So, what am I doing now….

 



 

The boulevard decorating the Laurent Square in the capital was already painted with the reds and yellows of autumn.

 

The ballroom of the Alstard Hotel, adorned with fragrant osmanthus and autumn roses, exuded meticulous opulence befitting an event hosted by the Altahart family. On closer inspection, it was dazzlingly luxurious, but the overall picture blended together naturally. Their display of luxury was so elaborate.

 

Many eyes were on the man standing in the center of the ballroom like a painting.

 

When he gave a smooth speech from the podium, there was at least a pretext to openly watch, but now, glances quickly turned away, fearful of being caught. The excitement in their eyes was clear, a pure curiosity towards the exceedingly handsome man.

 

“Well, who do we have here!”

 

Someone approached the man with a champagne glass. In a party like this, the military uniform naturally drew attention.

 

“Our little treasure of Altahart!”

 

Ulrich managed a slight smile, thinking how unbecoming the nickname was for someone of his age.

 

“Colonel Craxson, you made it.”

 

“Haha. These days, seeing your face is as hard as plucking a star from the sky. Only at events like these do I get to see this expensive face.”

 

The world was changing rapidly. At the end, even the once seemingly eternal authority of the nobility was fading like a setting sun.

 

Titles of nobility were no longer prestigious accomplishments. More and more areas were emphasizing visible financial power over such intangible authority.

 

Amidst the increasingly sharp conflict between the monarchy and parliament surrounding the state, the Altahart family maintained close ties with military units capable of mobilizing force, acting as a centrist power.

 

Strength, as unchanging in value as money.

 

Of course, it wasn’t just for political advantage. The more eyes on them, the more restricted their actions. For personal matters requiring manpower, it was much less conspicuous to use the Colonel’s name than that of Altahart. It was a friendship maintained for such purposes.

 

“I’ve been busy with various matters. Just last month, I sent a gift to you through my secretary. I hope you received it safely.”

 

“Oh, of course. I got it, and it was a big hit with my unit.”

 

“It was just a small gift.”

 

“Small gift? Come on, you should know when to be modest.”

 

Colonel Craxson’s eyes, slightly bloodshot from burst capillaries, were a common side effect among drug users. Standing before a soon-to-be addict, Ulrich smiled leisurely.

 

Having tried various substances himself, Ulrich had lost interest as he wasn’t fond of the hazy state induced by drugs. Still, many covertly brought him illicit substances as tribute.

 

He saw great returns from re-gifting these as bribes. What he gave to Colonel Craxson was an aphrodisiac that doubled its effect when taken with alcohol. The Colonel’s vacant eyes indicated he had spent the night indulging in drugs, alcohol, and women.



“By the way, it seems your proud brother is absent today.”

 

Ulrich was still smiling, but his smile had slightly faded.

 

“Oh, you were looking for Gwen, I see. Unfortunately, he has a separate engagement today.”

 

“Is that so? It’s been hard to see Gwen these days. In the past, we would at least bump into each other at the White Club, but even that’s rare now. With both brothers so busy, your family must be thriving. Isn’t that right?”

 

Colonel Craxson laughed heartily and patted Ulrich’s shoulder. Ulrich responded with a pleasant smile. Shortly afterward, hearing someone calling from the other side, Colonel Craxson bid farewell and walked away.

 

“Did you have a good conversation?”

 

Victor, who had been anxious since the Colonel’s arrival, quickly approached and asked.

 

“Listening to a drug addict’s ramblings is pointless.”

 

“Someone might hear you.”

 

“All he does is shoot blindly, he must be out of his mind. Otherwise, he wouldn’t say such nonsense about being proud of Gwen.”

 

No wonder he was so edgy; just as feared, Colonel Craxson had brought up Gwen.

 

“…You held yourself well.”

 

“The guests?”

 

“All those who received invitations have confirmed their attendance.”

 

“Is there anyone left I need to greet personally?”

 

“There is one person… Ah, here she comes.”

 

Ulrich turned towards where Victor was pointing.

 

A woman with elegant brown hair, half pinned with jeweled accessories, wearing an emerald chiffon dress, approached with the sound of clicking heels. Realizing the two knew each other, Victor quietly stepped back.

 

“Ulrich.”

 

Her voice was as graceful as a wild rose.

 

Ulrich lifted the gloved hand of the woman and kissed it. Among the ladies watching, exclamations of “Oh my!” were heard. The beauty of the approaching woman was extraordinary, and the two of them together looked like a piece of art.

 

As he lowered the hand he had been holding, Ulrich began to speak.

 

“I’m pleased you accepted the invitation, Lady Schwaben. Or should I call you Director Schwaben now?”

 

“You can still call me Daphne, as before.”

 

“I can’t do that. You’ve become the owner of the most famous art gallery in Laurent.”

 

“Are you drawing a line?”

 



 

“Don’t do that. I’ve called you Ulrich for a long time.”

 

Her eyes, asking prettily, were as moist as a deer’s. Ulrich looked down at her face, standing straight. Then Daphne took a step closer, clicking her heels.

 

“Is it because there are eyes watching us? Shall we go to a quiet place where no one is around?”

 

Ulrich’s eyebrows twitched slightly. Daphne’s clear and transparent eyes reflected that distinctly. A subtle tension, imperceptible to others, surrounded the two. Soon, Ulrich smiled meaningfully, as if to crush that atmosphere.

 

“A quiet place.”

 



 

“Why does it sound to me like you’re suggesting we do something naughty rather than have a conversation away from prying eyes?”

 

It was an unusually direct statement for the occasion. More surprising was Daphne’s reaction, blushing deeply as if shy. She was an unusual woman, now and then. He couldn’t deny that her unconventionality had once intrigued him.

 

He dismissed the fleeting past with a chuckle.

 

“Well, maybe in the past, but now it doesn’t seem appropriate.”

 

“What do you mean?”

 

“I mean our relationship.”

 

Ulrich leaned toward her slowly.

 

“You’re soon to be my brother’s wife.”

 



 

“Making a sister-in-law a secret mistress is a bit…”

 

Disgusting, isn’t it?

 

His voice was irresistibly seductive, meant only for her ears. As if to emphasize his point, Ulrich’s lips curved beautifully. It was the truth for him, but it was an offensive remark for her, touching on both her promiscuous past and her current respectable life.

 

Unexpectedly, Daphne let out a small laugh.

 

Ulrich maintained a smile, though his eyes showed a slight frown. His feelings mirrored this expression; he was put off by the unclear meaning of her laugh.

 

“It seems… the rumors about you being away from the capital for a while were true.”

 

“What do you mean?”

 

“If not, you would know better than I do.”

 

“I think you’ve had too much to drink.”

 

He smoothly wrapped a retort in polite language, and Daphne laughed, seemingly on purpose. Her inscrutable laughter subtly annoyed him.

 

“Today, I just came to greet you out of joy.”

 



 

“We’ll meet again soon, so let’s talk in detail then, Ulrich.”

 

“Yes, if you have any business, please make an appointment through my secretary.”

 

Even this clear statement that there would be no personal meetings didn’t dampen Daphne’s gentle smile as she left. Ulrich watched her departing figure, then signaled Victor, who was waiting nearby.

 

“I didn’t put that woman on the invitation list. Why is she here?”

 

“Well, actually… Madam Altahart reviewed the list later and added her.”

 

“My mother?”

 

“Yes.”

 

Hmm, Ulrich let out a significant hum.

 

“I can’t figure out the signal. Is it to make sure things are sorted out before my brother’s marriage?”

 

Daphne Schwaben.

 

Currently engaged to Gwen Altahart due to family alliances, she had once shared a bed with Ulrich. It wasn’t a relationship with heartfelt emotions but more of a mutually agreeable physical connection.

 

“If that’s the case, they’re sorely mistaken. It’s been sorted out long ago.”

 

That was the truth. Their time together was in the past. Enough time had passed for Daphne to be regarded as nothing more than a faded memory to Ulrich.

 

She had never held much significance to him anyway, but now, there was absolutely nothing left of their past connection.

 

Daphne had been one of the few who stayed by Ulrich’s side for quite some time among his past lovers. As someone who met him privately, she never overstepped her bounds publicly. She had a passable appearance and could nonchalantly handle his occasional harsh words.

 

Not because she was mature and broad-minded, but because her mind was inherently innocent, he concluded. It became evident while observing her.

 

Such traits didn’t often become a problem but occasionally amused Ulrich. Of course, he soon grew tired and unilaterally cut ties.

 

Afterward, she reappeared a year later as his brother’s fiancée.

 

“Can I leave now? They seem to be having a good time without me.”

 

Having attended the first part, including the owner’s speech, and staying through the second and third parts, considered the after-party, he had fulfilled his duties.

 

Victor nodded, and Ulrich set down the decorative glass he had been holding and sighed. Flashing a mesmerizing smile at anyone who met his eyes, he left the hall naturally.

 

Outside the banquet hall, he loosened the tight tie around his neck. The brooch pinned near the knot was bothersome.

 

He always had to dress meticulously for official events, down to the smallest detail, which was annoying. He never liked ties, but the one Lisbell gave him was nice because it lacked such cumbersome accessories.

 

It was smooth from the knot to the broad end, with nothing catching on his fingers, which he found refreshing. He developed a new habit of repeatedly smoothing it down when deep in thought, often wearing it at the Marnia villa.

 

Also, he found it amusing to see Lisbell shiver quietly whenever she saw it.


“Is that all?”

 

Despite knowing she could never escape, she still approached everything with intensity and desperation, which Ulrich found appealing.

 

To be honest, Ulrich had assumed that on the day Lisbell signed the contract with him, she would break off her engagement.

 

But she didn’t.

 

Until the day her fiancé visited the Marnia estate, Lisbell continued her hopeless relationship. That was her hope, as Ulrich saw in her beautiful face stained with drunken tears.

 

Even though it seemed she had given up, there was a subtle yet persistent desperation that kept her alive. How could that not pique his interest?

 

That’s why she crossed his mind even more in the capital.

 

People born into wealth, like him, who had never experienced true hardship, didn’t understand such intensity and desperation. For them, boasting and showing off was the sole purpose and pleasure in life.

 

Oddly enough, it was hard to feel any elegance from them. They seemed more vulgar and shameless. He was no exception; the entire Altahart family was like that. Their refined exteriors were just a facade, hiding dens of beasts filled with sordid desires.

 

Elegance.

 

Ironically, Ulrich felt it more in Lisbell, who tried her best in life. How could her earnest desire to live to the fullest not be considered noble?

 

Maybe he felt this way because he lacked it himself. She lived her life more meaningfully than he did, who found life so tedious that he wished to die soon.

 

In another sense, he wanted to delve deeper into her.

 

Why did she strive so hard to endure?

 

Everything ends in death anyway.

 

She would become like dust in the wind, ceasing to exist in this world….

 

Life is fleeting, yet Lisbell seemed to hold onto something that made her refuse to give up. This instinctive curiosity welled up within him, making him reflect on the roots of his own life.

 

He wondered what she would do if he severed all those lights she clung to and if he would feel any different from his current pessimistic self if he, too, found such light.

 

In any case, Lisbell was undoubtedly the greatest stimulant in his life right now.

 

He had planned to return to Marnia as soon as his schedule allowed, but the thought of the delicate scent that clung to him made him want to leave immediately. He wished the ground beneath his feet would change from the paved roads of the capital to Marnia’s lush lawns, not the marble reflecting the chandeliers of a luxury hotel.

 

Walking quickly but still composed, he headed for the quiet rear entrance of the hotel.

 



 

He was straightening his loosened tie when he noticed a sedan parked at the wide staircase below. The familiar face of the man standing courteously before the back seat caught his eye. Upon making eye contact, the man bowed respectfully.

 

“Madam Altahart sent me.”

 

It was his mother’s personal secretary.

 

“Oh dear.”

 

Ulrich muttered. It was a sigh of someone facing the inevitable.

 

He had hoped to leave quietly, but that seemed impossible.

 

Indeed, it was a bit surprising.

 

He hadn’t expected that his mother, let alone his brother Gwen, would attend an event that had already been communicated through Victor. It seemed they had retreated for a quiet meeting later.

 

Ignoring it would be an option, but if a summons from the family followed, it would complicate things. With a sigh, Ulrich obediently got into the back seat the secretary had opened for him.

 

The car glided smoothly along the central road.

 

The scenery of the capital hadn’t changed much. The glittering points of light that could hurt the eyes were still the same. Propping his chin, Ulrich surveyed the landscape before succumbing to fatigue and closing his eyes.

 

Soon, the sedan turned into a townhouse complex.

 

Passing by rows of grand houses, the car entered a massive estate even among the exclusive area.

 

Like an enlarged garden in Marnia, the expansive garden encircled a central fountain. The sedan came to a halt before a mansion boasting classic architectural style and vast grounds.

 

“We’ve arrived.”

 

With the driver’s announcement, the door opened.

 

Stepping out, Ulrich straightened his back, noting the staff lined up on either side, bowing deeply.

 

Despite so many visible heads, it was eerily silent, always a curious phenomenon. As Ulrich leisurely surveyed those waiting in hushed anticipation, he noticed the elderly butler approaching.

 

With a seemingly longer mustache, the butler greeted him courteously.

 

“Young Master, it’s been a while. Have you been well?”

 

“Considering I feel nauseous the moment I step in here, I suppose so.”

 

“That’s fortunate to hear. Madam is waiting for you. Please come in.”

 

Ignoring Ulrich’s sarcastic remark, the butler led the way. Unexpectedly interrupted on his way home, Ulrich checked his pocket watch. Leaving the reception early had given him some extra time.

 

Yet, in this house, you never knew when or where variables would arise. The topic his mother summoned him for would determine the extent of those variables.

 

“Oh my.”

 

As Ulrich entered the living room, a fond sigh greeted him.

 

He looked up to see his mother sitting regally on a single-seat sofa. A red-haired handsome man stood behind her. He was new.

 

“So, my hard-to-see son has finally arrived.”

 

“Glad to confirm I’m alive.”

 

Responding indifferently, Ulrich took a seat on the prepared sofa.

 

As he crossed his legs, a servant approached and listed the available beverages. Ulrich asked for a glass of iced soda. He was in a hurry, so he declined hot tea or coffee.

 

“Really, it’s heartbreaking…. How could you leave without a word? If Victor hadn’t been passing messages, I wouldn’t have known what to do.”

 

Acting as if deeply wounded by her son’s indifferent attitude, Lady Altahart clutched her chest. Ulrich chuckled at the sight.

 

“Your acting has improved.”

 

He leisurely added after quenching his thirst with the quickly served soda.

 

“What play inspired you this time?”

 

Both Ulrich and his brother Gwen knew well—his mother was the most eccentric person in this household.

 

She had a knack for changing faces, not in the surgical sense but in personality, as if another soul temporarily possessed her.

 

She had always loved theater, finding immense joy in observing others’ lives. “Tragedy up close, comedy from afar,” was a phrase she lived by.

 

Her husband’s death had let her whims bloom fully.



The beginning of it all was when the most popular male actor of the theater troupe came to the Altahart estate. At the time, I thought it was just because his charming appearance had caught her eye and she wanted to have some fun for a night.

 

But that wasn’t all.

 

The lady would take them as her lovers and then act as if she were the heroine of the play they starred in. She would fit herself into the role of their partner, living life as if she were that character. It was the essence of vicarious experience.

 

Those related to her realized this when the first male actor was quietly dismissed from his position as her lover, and a second actor was chosen to replace him.

 

When she was with them, her personality subtly changed. Since the heroines in the plays these actors starred in were different, she changed her face accordingly.

 

It was a bizarre act, but with enough money, nothing was impossible. And the lady had more than enough money to keep her secret dream alive.

 

Actors who caught her eye and served her received enormous sponsorship on a monthly basis. Furthermore, just the name Altahart was a powerful enough backing to ensure they wouldn’t be easily dismissed from leading roles. Their treatment within the troupe improved to almost that of the troupe leader.

 

Also, the lady had been a celebrated beauty in society. For a stunning woman like her, just a bit of flattery would make the money flow. It was a position many would volunteer for without hesitation.

 

To Ulrich, it seemed that his mother was currently absorbed in her own performance. The exaggerated act of dabbing at nonexistent tears with her long sleeves was an indication of that.

 

The “current” lover, standing by her side, comforted her, his touch subtly suggestive, befitting his role as a physical consort.

 

“So, what do you want from me?”

 

“Have you eaten?”

 

“Yes.”

 

“That’s a pity. I thought we could have a nice meal together after a long time.”

 

“Do that with my brother.”

 

“That’s difficult, which is why I’m asking you.”

 

Ulrich paused his idle sipping of sparkling water.

 

“What do you mean, difficult?”

 

“Gwen has collapsed.”

 

This was unexpected news.

 

Ulrich set down the glass he had been twirling.

 

“Suddenly?”

 

“Yes, it was a sudden blow.”

 

“Is there a problem?”

 

The lady sighed.

 

Her expression darkened slightly, revealing glimpses of her unmasked face.

 

“Syphilis, they say.”

 

“Syphilis?”

 

Ulrich let out a small laugh.

 

“That’s a sexually transmitted disease, isn’t it?”

 

Given Gwen’s promiscuous nature, it wasn’t entirely surprising.

 

“How is he?”

 

“Not good.”

 

“How bad?”

 

“Very.”

 

“Is he close to death?”

 

“Ulrich.”

 

“Judging by your reluctance to answer, I guess he is.”

 

The lady confirmed with silence.

 

Ulrich, resting his chin on his hand, turned to look out the window.

 

Gwen’s death, huh.

 

It was he who always spoke of suicide, but now it was his brother whose life was in danger. Life was truly unpredictable. Has Gwen written a proper will? If not, perhaps he should subtly intervene now. As he pondered this, his mother spoke again.

 

“So, Ulrich.”

 

“Yes.”

 

“You need to get married.”

 

Ulrich couldn’t believe his ears. The sudden shift in topic left him momentarily stunned.

 

“You know that Gwen is engaged to the young lady of the Schwaben family.”

 



 

“I’ve only informed them of Gwen’s condition, but the Schwaben Marquis seems uneasy. There are reports that he’s been attending social gatherings he rarely went to since the engagement. We need to present an alternative before he gets any strange ideas.”

 

“Is that alternative me?”

 

“Your marriage was bound to proceed once Gwen got married.”

 



 

“With Gwen in this state, you, as the second son, must take over his succession duties. Handling your marriage simultaneously isn’t a bad idea.”

 

“Do you desire the Schwaben family’s gemstone mines that much?”

 

“I can’t deny it. The assessment my appraiser finally completed indicates that the undeveloped mines will bring in a fortune. It would be foolish to miss out on such wealth.”

 



 

“And the Altahart family cannot afford to be foolish. You understand that, don’t you?”

 

Her assertion, reminding him of the scrutiny on their family, was sharp. Feeling a sudden tension in his neck, Ulrich rubbed it and glanced at the ambiguous corner between the ceiling and the wall.

 

“We’ll meet again soon to discuss the details, Ulrich.”

 

Now, he understood what Daphne meant at the hotel reception party.

 

“So, that’s why…”

 

Thinking of her made his head throb more. His past interest in her had faded, leaving only a weary residue.

 

Still, her carefree simplicity, which he had once found endearing, would now become an irritating thorn. Just anticipating the effort of dealing with her was exhausting, indicating that he had no affection left for her.

 

Yes, it was really bothersome.

 

There was someone else Ulrich wanted to observe 24/7, tied up right in front of him. So why this talk of Schwaben?

 

His lips curled with a crooked smile.

 

“What a shame. I’m already married.”

 

“…What?”

 

“And I have children.”

 

“This is nonsense.”

 

“I have three.”

 

“…Ulrich. What are you talking about?”

 

His mother’s stunned expression quickly regained composure.

 

“You’ve been in Marnia for less than a year. How could you have three children in that time?”

 

She saw through his nonsensical statements as a desperate attempt to avoid the arranged marriage.

 

“That’s a bias, Mother. They could be triplets.”

 

“If nothing else, I know my beloved son is speaking nonsense.”

 



 

“Now, stop this protest and come back to the capital.”

 

“To prepare for a marriage, right?”

 

“That’s not all. As I said, you need to take over the succession duties Gwen was supposed to handle, and time is running out.”

 



 

“You went to Marnia because Gwen refused to hand over the department store management rights. That problem is essentially resolved now, so I don’t see why you need to stay there.”

 

Her gaze was sharp like a well-honed blade. Despite appearing as a whimsical lady lost in her role-playing, she was undoubtedly the head of the Altahart family.

 

They didn’t hesitate to suppress emotions for the sake of the family and wealth. While the sadness over Gwen’s critical condition was not insignificant, maintaining the family’s position was more important. They prioritized ensuring that the family machinery continued to run smoothly over the death of a member.

 

Her stern and dry demeanor in using Gwen’s condition to bring Ulrich back to the capital was a testament to this duty.

 

It might seem cold, but that was how the Altahart family had amassed and maintained their wealth for generations.

 

They took what they wanted with relentless determination and discarded what they didn’t need without hesitation.

 

Ulrich, listening to his mother’s complaints, excused himself, using the bathroom as an excuse. Victor was waiting outside. As he walked past, Victor quickly followed.

 

“Should I have the car ready?”

 

“Before that, I should see my dying brother’s face.”

 

Ulrich’s calm tone made Victor look ashamed.

 

“I apologize for not informing you earlier.”

 

“When did you find out?”

 

“Just last week. The lady was very secretive about this.”

 

“Understandably so.”

 

Ulrich didn’t question further and walked quietly.

 

Navigating the long and complicated corridors without getting lost, he eventually stopped in front of a bedroom.



Knock Knock

 

When he knocked, a businesslike voice from inside asked for his identity. Instead of answering, he flung the door open. His mother’s trusted aide looked startled by the rude intrusion but quickly stepped back when he recognized it was Ulrich.

 

With the obstacle gone, Ulrich walked inside.

 



 

Reaching the bed, he crossed his arms and looked down at it askew.

 

On the bed, bathed in the soft afternoon sunlight, lay Gwen, who was said to be at death’s door. Just as the report had said, his once sturdy frame was severely deteriorated. He seemed to have lost a lot of weight, and his complexion was so pale it was unbearable to look at. It was as if he was showing the slow process of how a human being approaches death.

 

“Syphilis, huh?”

 

Of all the diseases, it had to be that one. It was a headache-inducing revelation. Unless even the god he worshipped was fed up with his merry romps and there was no other explanation for such bad luck, it was almost comically fitting for him.

 

In a way, it was a very appropriate end for him.

 

What goes around comes around, after all.

 

All he’d ever done in life was gamble away all his money at the White Club, where he had people preemptively bribe others to rig games, or take various drugs while indulging with prostitutes in his bedroom. Therefore, it was only fitting that his downfall would be so disgraceful.

 

“I wonder if, next time I see you, you’ll be lying in a coffin instead of a bed.”

 



 

“Before that, I must make sure to get your signed resignation from managing the department store.”

 

In their family, the mention of money could wake anyone from their sleep. It wouldn’t be a bad idea to secure everything firmly in case he miraculously returned from the grave. It was a pragmatic conversation to have in front of a dying brother, but there was no other choice. After all, Ulrich himself was also an Altahart.

 

He leaned forward. A long shadow cast over Gwen’s body lying under the blanket.

 

“It might have been your last wish, but you certainly managed to hold me back.”

 



 

“I hadn’t planned to come back to the capital just yet….”

 

Ulrich muttered ominously to his unconscious brother and then sensed someone’s presence, turning his head.

 

The door connecting to a small room inside the bedroom was open. A child was standing behind the door, peeking in.

 

Ulrich immediately recognized the child as his brother’s illegitimate son.

 

As their eyes met, the child’s shoulders shot up in surprise. He was so startled that they didn’t settle back down for a long while.

 

Ulrich straightened up from leaning over Gwen. The shadow that had stretched menacingly over his brother also retreated.

 

The child pursed his lips as if he might burst into tears. Sensing the child’s anxiety, Ulrich uncrossed his arms and walked towards the door.

 

He stopped just a step away from the child and bent his knees to meet the child’s eye level.

 

“Honestly.”

 

Ulrich slowly extended his hand.

 

He gently patted the platinum-blond hair that was so similar to his own and Gwen’s. The child flinched at the sudden touch but gradually relaxed, feeling no threat in the hand’s movement.

 

“You really make things difficult for everyone….”

 

The child’s innocent eyes darted around, unable to find focus. Watching the child’s genuine confusion, Ulrich murmured quietly,

 

“Irresponsible Gwen Altahart.”

 

After patting the child’s head a few more times, Ulrich left the bedroom.

 

Victor, waiting outside, informed him that the car was ready. Ulrich headed straight for the exit. He briefly told a servant following him that he had urgent business and then got into the car, taking out his pocket watch.

 

Even if they drove nonstop from now on, they would only reach Marnia after dark.

 

His fingers tapped the side of the pocket watch as if measuring something. It was a close call. Somehow, the inside of his heart thumped. It had been a while since he felt this kind of thrill.

 

“Victor.”

 

“Yes, sir.”

 

“Find out if there are any long-term hospital rooms available at the Royal Capital Hospital.”

 

“Hospital rooms, sir?”

 

“Yes,” Ulrich replied, turning his gaze out the window.

 

As he looked at his brother lying there, rotting like a corpse, what surprisingly came to his mind was a complete stranger. It was the villa in Marnia where he had spent a few months; someone else was bedridden there in a similar condition to his brother.

 

And he kept thinking of the small nape of someone who stayed by that bed no matter the rain or snow. The nape with hair that used to be well-groomed but now often left unkempt as if they had given up on caring for themselves.

 

“Have you… ever loved anyone?”

 

The violet eyes that looked at him.

 

Ulrich quietly smiled, gazing indifferently out the window.

 

Love.

 

He occasionally saw people in love.

 

Sometimes he heard about it through rumors, and sometimes he witnessed it with his own eyes.

 

Despite their different forms and stories, they all had one fatal commonality.

 

They were all out of their minds.

 

People in love often did crazy things.

 

It was as if that absurdly childish and crude emotion grabbed the person’s brain and shook it wildly.

 

Ulrich hated such things.

 

It was nothing but disgraceful and pathetic.

 

Whenever he saw those who voluntarily jumped into the fire under the guise of such illogical emotions, all he felt was cold contempt that made his entire body freeze.

 

Naturally, acceptance and understanding were out of the question.

 

Above all, that emotion was too fragile.

 

For an Altahart, who had to deal with people all their life, it was an unnecessary attitude and condition. Being in love meant having a weakness. Letting someone else hold your heart was an incredibly dangerous thing.

 

You didn’t have to look far.

 

Just look at Lisbell Osborne.

 

Because she loved her mother and her fiancé, she was constantly pushed around. Her pitiful and wretched state was the result of her love, which she talked about so much.

 

Ulrich had no desire to end up like that.

 

That’s why he openly laughed at Lisbell’s assertion that he had never been in love. There was nothing to offer but a contemptuous smirk to someone who bragged about something he never even wanted.

 

The car’s engine purred softly.

 

Imagining the situation waiting for him in Marnia, Ulrich leaned back comfortably in his seat.



Swish.

 

Lisbell’s gaze, which was fixed on her book, lifted.

 

Perhaps it was just a momentary whim of the weather, but a heavy rain, which hadn’t been predicted earlier, was now pouring down outside the window.

 

She tried to read her book again but soon gave up.

 

The sound of rain invading the bedroom was louder than expected, swallowing up her tiny voice. She could speak a little louder, but at the moment, she didn’t feel the energy for it.

 

She just accepted it.

 

Though she knew getting used to giving up wasn’t beneficial, she was too tired to fight every little thing.

 

It had been like this since Theodore had visited. The small hope she had held onto like grains of sand slipped through her fingers, and she had no will left to grab onto anything again.

 

Since that day, Lisbell had picked up the telephone several times only to put it back down. She kept hesitating, torn between telling Theodore the truth now or fearing it was too late.

 

If she had meant to hold on, she should have followed him that day. Since giving up at that moment, the relationship had irreparably fractured.

 

Even though she desperately wanted to fix it, her current situation made it impossible. It would only lead to the same cruel repetition.

 

So Lisbell let Theodore go little by little.

 

Even if he left, she still had someone left.

 

“Mother.”

 

Lisbell, putting her book down, grasped her mother’s dry hand on the blanket. It still lacked any warmth. As she massaged her mother’s hand, hoping for better blood circulation, her eyes darkened. She thought of the man who had saved her mother’s life but had, in return, thrown her into the mud.


He wasn’t at the villa at the moment. Two days ago, he had to leave for an appointment in the capital. He said it would take about three days, so he would return to Marnia either today or tomorrow.

 

That fact occasionally returned as a bitter reality.

 

The reason was her own appearance, still staying in a corner of this villa even though he was not here.

 

There was nothing physically holding her, but Lisbell was trapped in this villa. An inescapable reality tied her tightly to this place, which felt like a prison.

 

Still, until recently, she seemed to have held onto some faint hope, but now she wasn’t sure.

 

Would the day come when her mother would regain consciousness and open her eyes?

 

Was she clinging to a hope that was too much like ashes?

 

She couldn’t even hold it tight because she was scared, but even if she did, it would eventually shatter. Was she holding onto such a fragile hope?

 



 

It was then.

 

Lisbell’s eyelashes fluttered.

 

“…Mother?”

 

She felt a faint movement in her mother’s fingers, which she had been holding and rubbing for a long time.

 

Was it an illusion?

 

Was it really an illusion?

 

Forgetting even the worn-out hope she had been chewing over, Lisbell stood up suddenly.

 

“Mother… Mother!”

 

Her voice, already delicate and now cracked like parched land from not speaking to anyone for nearly two days since Ulrich left, desperately called out. Responding to her call, her mother’s fingers twitched once more.

 

Lisbell hurriedly looked at her mother’s face. As if nerves that had been asleep for a long time were waking up one by one, strength entered here and there. Soon, her mother’s eyelids gradually lifted. Lisbell, seeing the purple eyes she hadn’t seen since they returned to Marnia, felt a surge of emotion.

 

“Mother, are you coming to your senses?”

 

Having been unconscious for quite a while, her mother couldn’t come to her senses right away. After a long period of numbness, her eyes, which barely regained focus, looked at her daughter who was holding her hand desperately.

 

She opened her dry lips. No sound came out. Perhaps because her vocal cords were strained from not being used for so long, only a dry, raspy sound escaped.

 

“Wait, just a moment. I’ll get you some water.”

 

Lisbell propped her up and quickly grabbed a water glass. After filling it up, she brought it to her mother’s lips and tilted it. Her mother couldn’t swallow well even then. As she coughed, Lisbell wiped the wet corners of her mouth with a handkerchief.

 

“Are you okay?”

 

“Lisbell.”

 

The name her mother managed to call out, after barely stopping her cough, reached her ears.

 

Ah, why does it feel so dreamlike to hear this voice calling me? Lisbell’s eyes filled with tears, unsure whether from longing or relief. As she quietly wiped them away, Mrs. Osborne’s eyes, seemingly becoming clearer in consciousness, looked around.

 

“Where…?”

 

“This is Marnia Villa. The place where you used to work, Mother.”

 

“What on earth… happened?”

 

“Don’t you remember? Mother, you collapsed.”

 

“What?”

 

“Why didn’t you tell me?”

 



 

“Why didn’t you say a word about being unwell…?”

 

Why didn’t you say anything…?

 

Her voice, choked with sobs, was cut off.

 

Mrs. Osborne, sensing how the secret she had desperately wanted to hide had been revealed, let out a small sigh.

 

“It seems I’ve caused you worry.”

 

“They said you collapsed while working. Your condition was so bad that you went straight into surgery.”

 

“Surgery…? I had surgery? Then, how did we manage the cost?”

 

Lisbell smiled bitterly at her mother, who couldn’t help but bring up money even in this situation.

 

“…Mr. Altahart helped us.”

 

“The master did?”

 

“Yes.”

 

“So… that’s why I’m here?”

 

Her mother seemed clueless about everything. It was natural. Although many things had happened to Lisbell, it was all during the time her mother was unconscious. In a way, the foundation of this situation was laid before she collapsed, but Lisbell had kept it a secret, so there was no blame to place on her mother.

 

“The master is….”

 

“He’s not here right now.”

 

“Not here?”

 

“He went to the capital.”

 

“…What is going on…? Anyway, it seems the master took care of me. Did he contact you to come here? And you’ve been by my side since then? What’s the date today? How long have I been unconscious?”

 

Lisbell, calmly tidying up her mother’s wrinkled blanket, spoke.

 

“Summer has just passed.”

 



 

“Autumn will be here soon.”

 

Her mother’s fussy actions suddenly stopped. The mention of the change in seasons carried a clear implication.

 

The one who knew better than anyone that her daughter would be a bride in late summer was Mrs. Osborne. She also knew that her daughter was supposed to leave for another country after the wedding.

 

It was something that should have happened before the end of summer. So the fact that her daughter was still here could only mean one thing.

 

“Lisbell, you…”

 

“I’m breaking off my engagement with Theo.”

 

“…Is it because of me?”

 

“It’s not like that.”

 

Lisbell reached out to calm her mother, who was already sinking into grief. Pulling up the blanket that had slipped down her body, she whispered softly.

 

“It was my decision.”

 

“Lisbell.”

 

“So you don’t need to worry, Mother.”

 



 

“Please lie down, Mother. You just woke up, and if you strain yourself like this….”

 

“Lisbell!”

 

As Lisbell was about to turn away to contact the doctor staying in the annex, her wrist was grabbed.

 

The strength was quite strong for someone who had just woken up. It showed how desperate her mother was.

 

“Tell me honestly. Have I become a burden to you…?”

 

Looking down at her mother’s emaciated hand, Lisbell gently placed it back and covered it with her palm.

 

“It’s okay, Mother.”

 



 

“Really, it’s all okay.”

 

Her voice was hollow. It felt that way because she tried to keep as much emotion out of it as possible.

 

But this was the best. Her mother had been unconscious for a long time and had just opened her eyes. Even though she had recovered enough to communicate after the long rest, she still needed to be careful. And the truths she had to reveal would undoubtedly be too much for her mother.

 

“Sleep a little more, Mother.”

 

Hold on.

 

It’s not the right time yet.

 

So hold on, endure, and persevere, and then, when everything seems back to normal….

 

Lisbell’s hand, pulling up the blanket, hesitated. A sense of despair briefly crossed her mind, wondering if such a day would ever come for her. Mrs. Osborne, who had been silently watching her daughter, caught her hesitation.

 

“The air is a bit chilly. If you feel cold, use this blanket….”

 

“Why….”

 



 

“Why are you so… thin?”

 

Mrs. Osborne’s small question froze Lisbell.

 

“Lisbell, was your wrist always this thin…?”

 

That one sentence was the problem.

 

All the fabricated sentences, busy trying to fill everything with lies, evaporated from her mind. At that moment, hearing those words, she felt as if she was hitting an insurmountable wall. Along with occasional feelings of injustice and futility.

 

Why did she have to swallow everything?

 

If she hid it from Theodore and even from her mother, whom could she confide in about this endlessly turbulent turmoil inside her?

 

Drip Drip

 

Tears suddenly poured out. Lisbell quickly covered her mouth with her hand. She knew she had to stop, but it wasn’t working. Rubbing her tear-filled eyes, she spoke incoherently.

 

“No, this is, this is just….”

 

“Lisbell.”

 

Her mother’s voice, unlike her own tearful one, was firm. She looked up with deeply trembling eyes. Mrs. Osborne, having sensed the discord, silently held Lisbell’s wrist tightly.

 

The strength was stronger than Lisbell had vaguely imagined. It felt like a signal that she wouldn’t collapse even after hearing her confession. Even knowing it was just a fragile mind wanting to depend, Lisbell, as if mesmerized, opened her mouth. It was right to say she couldn’t hold out any longer.

 

“The truth is, actually….

 

Tears rolled down her cheeks and fell onto the bedding covering her mother.

 

She didn’t even know what she was saying. Relying on the hot tears, she poured out the things she hadn’t been able to tell anyone, incoherently.

 

With her head bowed low, she couldn’t see her mother’s expression. She couldn’t bear to look. Even knowing that her mother’s face would be as contorted as her own, she knew it was irrevocable. It wasn’t possible, and she realized she didn’t have enough energy left inside.

 

It was at that point.

 

Without even realizing it, she had collapsed to such a point.

 

After a heavy confession, only the cold air remained in the bedroom. She could easily picture her mother, completely pale from head to toe, after learning the truth. As regret, spreading like a bruise from inside, took over.

 

“Why….”

 

A faint but undeniable warmth touched her cheek. Lisbell flinched and looked up. Her vision, blurred with tears, was cloudy.

 

So she couldn’t see her mother’s expression, but she could sense it.

 

“Why didn’t you say anything?”

 



 

“Why didn’t you tell me….”

 

She finally understood.

 

Her mother’s stubborn refusal to mention her own condition was no different from her own determination to hide every setback she faced.

 

No, it was a mirror image of her own actions.


Lean and frail, Lisbell leaned on those diligent hands trying to wipe away her tears and completed her confession. Her mother, unable to hide her shock, occasionally stiffened her expression and soon after, tears welled up in her own eyes.

 

“Oh my god, the master…”

 

Unable to continue, the lady clutched her chest with a clenched fist, unable to bear it. Lisbell, unable to wipe away her own tears, tried to calm her mother, fearing that even such actions might strain her.

 

“I should have been honest from the start. If I had, things wouldn’t have gotten this bad…”

 

“Lisbell, you don’t need to eat yourself up over it.”

 



 

“I think I understand how we both feel now…”

 

Lisbell’s heart ached. She bit her lip, then nodded carefully.

 

Mrs. Osborne, who was gently stroking her daughter’s pale cheek, looked out the window. Watching the now lighter rain, she suddenly spoke.

 

“Let’s leave together.”

 

“…What?”

 

“I can’t leave you in this place any longer.”

 



 

“Before the master returns… we should quickly gather our things and leave.”

 

Lisbell was taken aback.

 

“But, but mother. I have a contract with him. And mother, you just woke up. Your condition…”

 

“Don’t worry about me. It’s not as bad as you think.”

 

To prove her point, her mother swung her legs out of bed. Lisbell quickly moved to support her. With her help, her mother stood up slowly and took a few steps around the bed.

 

“You said the problem was my surgery and hospital bills. If we break the contract, we’ll just have to repay that money. We’ll leave this place together… and pay it off gradually. That’s what we’ll do. No matter how long it takes, as long as we can repay it, there’s no reason for you to be treated this way.”

 

Lisbell was momentarily stunned. It was something she couldn’t handle alone, something that had always brought her to her knees. Her mother was discussing it so easily.

 

It’s not something that can be handled so easily.

 

Doubt grew from the adversities Lisbell had to face here.

 

But only for a moment.

 

Before her mother regained consciousness, there were many things that gave her psychological pressure. The overwhelming costs and the confession she couldn’t bring herself to make to Theodore.

 

But now her mother had opened her eyes, and now that she had given up her future with Theodore, there was no reason to be held back by that fact.

 

In other words, I am free…

 

“Is it really… okay?”

 



 

“Can I, can I leave this place?”

 

A fine ray of light seeped into Lisbell’s cloudy eyes. Mrs. Osborne gently stroked her daughter’s hair and said.

 

“Of course.”

 



 

“You, Lisbell, you don’t have to be tied to anyone like this. Especially not because of me.”

 

The hope that seemed impossible alone was now overflowing just because her mother had opened her eyes.

 

Having made a decision, her heart grew impatient. Although she had regained consciousness, her mother was still an invalid with limited mobility. To head to the train station with her, they had to hurry.

 

Though unspoken, mother and daughter shared the same thought: this had to be done before Ulrich returned to Marnia.

 

Even if Ulrich escalated the issue to a lawsuit, as long as their intent to repay was communicated, they would manage. First, they had to escape from this place filled with bad memories and psychological pressure to see any sign of a new beginning. Her mother surely thought the same.

 

Lisbell went to her room and opened her suitcase. She packed a few pieces of clothing and some travel money, then grabbed an umbrella from the wardrobe.

 

Fortunately, the rain was light.

 

“Mother, hold onto my arm tightly. If it feels too rushed, let me know immediately.”

 

Lisbell wrapped a cape around her mother’s shoulders to protect her from the cold weather and stepped out.

 

The gate was open, probably for Ulrich’s return today or tomorrow. Lisbell, tightly supporting her mother to prevent her from falling, passed through the gate.

 

It was unbelievable. She never imagined she would leave the villa with her mother so safely.

 

Then, Mrs. Osborne coughed.

 

“Are you okay?”

 

“Don’t worry about me. Let’s go.”

 

Reading Lisbell’s worried gaze, Mrs. Osborne smiled. Even that pale smile was worrisome. They needed to reach the train station quickly to let her rest.

 

Leaving the iron gate, they soon entered a narrow path. Due to the heavy rain, the ground was muddy. Supporting her coughing mother, Lisbell walked along the path heavily scented with rain.

 

After the narrow path, a vast meadow stretched out, with a winding road running through it.

 

On days without rain, she occasionally saw carriages passing by. She hoped they could catch one.

 

As she heard the leaves shuddering from the raindrops, the narrow path came to an end. Lisbell tilted her umbrella back to survey the surroundings.

 

As her view cleared, the weight of her mother leaning on one arm suddenly increased. Lisbell dropped the umbrella and hurriedly caught her mother.

 

“Mother? Mother!”

 

Mrs. Osborne’s complexion was as pale as a sheet, much worse than before. She trembled all over and then coughed with her last strength.

 

Blood spread around her lips. It was hemoptysis. Horrified, Lisbell hurriedly propped her against a tree trunk.

 

“Mother, what’s wrong…! Mother!”

 

The rain pounded painfully in her ears.

 

Lisbell didn’t think of retrieving the fallen umbrella but frantically checked her mother.

 

But the situation didn’t improve.

 

In fact, it only got worse. Her mother, who had been coughing, was now pale and still, her eyes gently closed.

 

Lisbell knew that face well.

 

The face she had seen almost daily in the cozy bedroom of the villa.

 

The face of her mother who hadn’t regained consciousness after surgery.

 

That face now loomed over her mother like a demon. With trembling hands, Lisbell cupped her mother’s cheeks.

 

Mother, mother.

 

Her faint breaths shattered against the falling raindrops.

 

Mother, mother, mother…

 

Lisbell kept calling. Standing before the vast meadow, she felt trapped in a small box, overwhelmed by a sense of claustrophobia. As the waves of anxiety rose, she let her tears flow, lowering her trembling hands.

 

Slowly, she leaned in.

 

She pressed her ear to her mother’s chest, wrapped in the cape.

 

Thump, thump, thump.

 

It was beating.

 

But.

 

Thump… thump… thump…

 

It was slow. It was slowing down. Her mother’s heartbeat was gradually slowing.

 

Was the anxiety chilling her fingertips creating an illusion?

 

She wished it were so, but it seemed highly unlikely. Her mother had stopped coughing altogether.

 

“No, no…”

 

Please, please.

 

Even as she chanted, the beating in her ears grew fainter. Like a dying flame, it seemed inevitable that it would finally go out.

 

Lisbell turned her head blankly in the midst of the relentless downpour.

 

Toward the villa.

 

There was a doctor there. If she carried her mother and ran now, sprinted with all her might, she might save her.

 

But… she couldn’t bring herself to act.

 

Go back?

 

Again?

 

To that villa?

 

No.

 

How could she go back after finally escaping?

 

I don’t want to.

 

What determination had it taken to leave?

 

Never…

 

I don’t want to go back.

 

To that place that sucked the meaning out of everyday life, never…

 

“Ugh…”

 

She felt nauseous. The situation that kept forcing her into such lowly choices made her shudder with all her heart.

 

Even now, with her mother’s heartbeat slowing to a stop in front of her, Lisbell clutched her head. A soundless scream burst from her open lips. It felt like the scene in the drawing room was repeating itself. As if she were trapped in a very bad, helpless prank.

 

The rain poured heavily.

 

Earlier, it seemed bearable, but now it felt like a torrential downpour, crushing her body unbearably. The rain-soaked her hair and seemed to penetrate her brain. Her body grew heavy and wet. The temperature of the rain was as cold as ice. Her body, drenched in it, cooled down.

 

And so did her heart.

 

“…Mother.”

 

No response.

 

“Mother.”

 

No matching gaze.

 

“Mother…”

 

In front of this despicable display, her vile nature.

 

If I give you up, I don’t have to return to that hell, do I…


Tok.

 

A raindrop, precariously hanging on the edge of a leaf, fell onto Lisbell’s head.

 

“…!”

 

At that moment, she experienced a feeling of her heart plummeting to the ground.

 

Startled, she fell backward, landing on her backside. Without even thinking of adjusting her clothes soaked in the muddy puddle, she covered her mouth with her hand.

 

Feeling as if she were seeing a detached soul, an eerie and shivering sensation washed over her, and Lisbell was seized by the impulse to peel off her own skin. A wave of guilt washed over her, gnawing at her like bitter bile.

 

How could this happen?

 

No matter how the situation turned out, how could she even think of abandoning her mother…

 

She felt like a horrible monster.

 

Facing the freedom she wanted to reclaim, she was about to abandon her only blood relative. In other words, she was choosing a cowardly escape over the evident way to save her mother, overwhelmed by extreme selfishness. Even amidst this, she despised herself for only wanting not to return to that villa.

 

Unable to move forward or backward, Lisbell collapsed weakly. In the rain that seemed to wash away her senses and melt her very existence, she was sinking deeper, almost to the point of being buried under the ground.

 

A round violet light gathered above the trees.

 

Through the pouring rain, a car quietly appeared.

 

The source of the violet light near the tree her mother was leaning against was the car’s headlights. The engine sound pierced through the noise of the rainwater and settled.

 

The car stopped in front of the path, and the back door opened.

 

A black umbrella popped up. Unlike herself, who was struggling even to avoid a single drop of rain, the man who got out of the car, Ulrich, had returned to the villa before she could escape and was calmly standing there, avoiding the rain.

 

What she couldn’t even dream of avoiding was something he could handle with a mere gesture.

 

A new awareness struck her as a fresh despair.
