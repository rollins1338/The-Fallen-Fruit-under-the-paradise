Chapter 76.

“Yes?”

 

“I asked if you truly thought that.”

 

Daphne’s curious touch halted. Ulrich didn’t take his eyes off her face right in front of him. Daphne, who had initially been silent under his direct gaze, eventually drew back her hand with a faint smile.

 

“Of course. Even though we didn’t spend much time together, he was still my fiancé.”

 

The scent of deceit was strong.

 

Indeed, even she would have felt some relief at Gwen’s death.

 

Those born into noble families enjoyed much wealth and power, but also had responsibilities and duties. Marriage was no exception. In many cases, partners were decided at a very young age or even while still in the womb, especially if family ties were strong. And barring any significant variables, they would eventually marry that chosen partner.

 

The process of Daphne Schwaben becoming Gwen’s fiancée was no different. This meant there was a high probability that Daphne had no say in the matter. It wasn’t unusual. The world they inhabited treated such arrangements as customary and obligatory.

 

The problem was that her fiancé happened to be Gwen Altahart.

 

The eldest son of the Altahart family was notorious for his promiscuity and volatile temperament, coupled with excessive greed.

 

Daphne had already endured significant hardships because of Gwen even before marriage. Ulrich had revealed a scandal involving his brother one morning. As a result of their engagement, not only could one gain more capital and honor, but they could also be dragged into the mud together.

 

Even though the Altahart family quickly took action, the story had already spread within the social circles. Given that it was well-known that their family controlled much of the capital’s media, the scandal seemed even more plausible. Consequently, Daphne’s reputation suffered as well.

 

Ulrich also bore some responsibility for the incident, but he felt no remorse towards Daphne. If there was anyone to blame, it was the now-deceased Gwen. The whole affair wouldn’t have happened if Gwen had not disregarded their wager. Gwen’s irresponsible actions had brought about this trouble.

 

Having gone through such an ordeal, learning about her fiancé’s promiscuous lifestyle, it was not surprising that marriage seemed extremely distasteful to her.

 

“That’s right.”

 

Daphne smiled brightly at his affirming words, as if it was a needless denial. She was a woman whose true feelings were hard to discern. Ulrich shook his head inwardly and picked up the coffee cup on the table.

 

“You two look like a perfect picture together.”

 

The lady watching them from the opposite side suddenly joined in.

 

Ulrich let out a dry laugh as he took a sip of coffee. He couldn’t shake the feeling that she had called him here just to make that statement.

 

Ulrich didn’t often have individual meetings with his mother. They each had their roles, and outside of those duties, there was little time for leisure or rest. Moreover, it was difficult to adjust to his mother’s peculiar nature in a subtle way, so he didn’t particularly enjoy these encounters.

 

However, today’s meeting was prompted by the issue of Gwen’s illegitimate child. As he caressed the coffee cup in his hand, Ulrich looked out the window.

 

“Do nothing? I’m a living person. I have willpower and I breathe. I can’t just sit idly by. If you truly want that, you should have brought a corpse that can’t move.”

 

It was about time for that resilient spirit to stretch its limbs.

 

Persuading his mother to take care of the child was a form of placation. There were many things she shouldn’t know yet. Pressing her continuously would only result in her breaking apart.

 

It was strange. The curiosity that should have stopped at a certain point did not cease, and the more he watched, the more interesting it became. Lately, even the letters placed neatly on the mantle every morning piqued his interest.

 

At this point, he wanted to watch everything.

 

That was why he felt as if he had lost somehow.

 

Could desires and curiosity linger so long and persistently? Though it was different from before, it didn’t feel particularly unpleasant. If so, there was no reason to cut it off. Ulrich still wanted to hold her in his palm and play with her as he pleased.

 

He had no expectations when he mentioned the child’s education to his mother. It seemed more appropriate to yield a step to Lisbell at the moment. He was contemplating whether to use this as a new leverage to threaten his mother, but surprisingly, she agreed.

 

Instead, she wanted to spend a day with him.

 

Today was that day, and when he arrived, Daphne Schwaben was there. Moreover, there were remarks about how well they suited each other. Her intentions were so blatant that it was almost embarrassing.

 

“I must say, I’ve often thought Miss Schwaben suits you better than Gwen. You two seem to be in harmony, don’t you? Just look at how well you sit together now.”

 

“Is that so?”

 

“I couldn’t say it before because I didn’t want to hurt Gwen’s pride. Oh dear, is it rude to say such things to Miss Schwaben?”

 

“Not at all. I’m taking it as a very generous compliment.”

 

“That’s a relief.”

 

The two women played along elegantly, as if rehearsed. It felt like watching a silly play, with each trying to paint the other’s face with gold.

 

As he wondered how long this charade would last, Ulrich quietly sipped his coffee.

 

Judging by the situation, it was clear his mother would soon propose a new engagement to the Schwsben family. And Daphne, sitting next to him, was likely already aware of this.

 

When his thoughts reached that point, Ulrich put down his coffee cup with a clink.

 

“You should find paintings at the Schwaben family’s art gallery, Ulrich”

 

It was amusing for a moment, but that was all. His interest quickly waned. Once he lost interest, he never regained it. Daphne, sitting next to him dreaming of marriage, was that lost interest. Staying any longer was just a waste of time.

 

“I’d love to stay longer, but my schedule is quite tight today.”

 

Even if it was an excuse, it wouldn’t matter, but unfortunately, he was genuinely busy these days. He had to take over the succession process that Gwen had concluded, and it wasn’t easy. He had to deal with the distribution issue at the Altstad department store immediately.

 

“Don’t look at me like that, Mother. You know better than anyone how hectic my schedule is these days.”

 

Rising from his seat, Ulrich walked around the table towards his mother, who looked at him resentfully. He took her hand gently and kissed the back of it.

 

“If I had known there would be a guest, I would have tried to reschedule.”

 

“Yes, indeed.”

 

“I also apologize to Miss Schwaben.”

 

“No need to apologize.”

 

Conscious of the surrounding eyes, Ulrich also kissed the back of Daphne’s hand. Though it was a soulless gesture, his naturally graceful demeanor made it seem sincere.

 

Just as he was about to let go of Daphne’s hand.

 

“We’re planning a big exhibition at the Schwaben Gallery soon.”

 



 

“Ulrich, may I send you an invitation?”

 

One of Ulrich’s eyebrows twitched upward.

 

At this point, this bold direct approach seemed like a strategy.

 

His family had always avoided private invitations. Unless it was a major event like the opening of the Altstad Hotel 2nd branch, they rarely appeared in such settings.

 

This was another form of control. As much as they were in the spotlight, their associations were scrutinized.

 

Associations could be beneficial but could also be harmful. Especially in these times of rapidly changing circumstances and the constant fall of someone’s reputation, being wrongly associated could lead to scandal.

 

Therefore, the Altahart family had always avoided accepting such invitations.


Chapter 77.

For a while now, Daphne, who had been engaged to Gwen, could not have been unaware of this. Nevertheless, her steadfast invitation reflected her confidence in the establishment of their engagement. And surely, this was driven by her mother’s encouragement.

 

His mind cooled down. The situation that left him with no immediate way to refuse made him uneasy.

 

After a moment, Ulrich displayed an artistic smile.

 

“Gladly, I will wait.”

 

Daphne’s face blossomed like a sunflower under the sun as she waited for his answer.

 

Ulrich nodded slightly, indicating his intention to leave. As he turned, a beam of brilliant sunlight graced his face. Leaning into it, he pretended to squint at the brightness and wiped the smile off his face.

 

***

 

Soft conversations blossomed like petals in his ears. The recently isolated Lisbell naturally directed her attention toward them.

 

Far off, at the end of the corridor, two servants were having a private conversation. As she watched them, they seemed to sense her gaze and turned their heads, easily spotting her.

 

The two immediately distanced themselves and bowed politely. Their frosty demeanor made it difficult for Lisbell to engage in conversation, leaving her to watch them walk away again today.

 

…There’s no leeway there.

 

Before Noah came along, she recalled the days spent in Ulrich’s bedroom, akin to a hunting trophy hung on the wall. She had felt the same back then; they must have received specific instructions. Otherwise, why would they flee the moment they saw her without a moment’s hesitation?

 

To gather information from the outside, it would have been advantageous to win over one of them, but it was no easy task. In fact, it seemed almost impossible.

 

How could she get any news about her mother?

 

“If you ever need my help, feel free to ask.”

 

A voice suddenly echoed in her ear.

 

Julian might bring more valuable information than the servants she planned to recruit. Unlike her, he seemed to have free access to and from the mansion, with countless places he could go.

 

However, without knowing the reason for his kindness, she couldn’t readily accept his help. Lisbell had come to understand that there was no such thing as a favor without a reason. All kindness had a motive, and if it wasn’t visible, there was likely a dark greed behind it. Julian, too, might want something from her. This assumption dispelled any desire to accept his help.

 

Before she knew it, she was standing in front of Noah’s bedroom.

 

Knock, knock.

 

Knock.

 

Knock, knock, knock.

 

Lisbell knocked in a rhythmic pattern before opening the door.

 

As soon as she stepped into the room, Noah came running to her from afar, clinging to her skirt.

 

The unique knocking pattern was Lisbell’s signal that she had arrived. Noah was afraid of strangers entering his room. After opening the door a few times and startling him, she had devised this method.

 

“Noah, good morning. Did you sleep well?”

 

“Yes….”

 

Noah answered while rubbing his flushed cheeks against her skirt. Lisbell gently stroked his platinum blonde hair and headed towards the desk.

 

“Did you do the homework I gave you yesterday?”

 

“Yes, yes, I did!”

 

Noah’s little head bobbed up and down. Lisbell patted the back of his head as a sign of praise and opened the textbook.

 

The child was keeping up with the lessons better than she had feared. She had been worried since he hadn’t received proper education before, but he seemed to absorb everything quickly like a blank slate.

 

Today was a basic math lesson. She repeated the steps of calculations several times for him to understand the theory and then gave him a few problems to solve on his own. While Noah was struggling with the problems, Lisbell took out a new sheet of paper.

 

Dear Mother,

 

The opening was always the same.

 

Whenever Noah was engrossed in his work, Lisbell would sit beside him and write letters as if solving her own life problems. She used to do this mainly in the study, but now that she visited Noah’s room more often, she did it there.

 

She had filled about half the letter when Noah, who had been burying his head and shaking his pencil, suddenly took an interest in what she was doing.

 

“What are you doing…?”

 

Noah had a rather short attention span. His curiosity was piqued by Lisbell’s hand moving faster than his own. She gently brushed his disheveled golden hair and replied kindly.

 

“I’m writing a letter to my mother.”

 

“Mother?”

 

“Yes, my mother is sick and in the hospital right now.”

 

Thinking of her mother, her relatively good mood quickly plummeted. This was the most troubling issue she had been dealing with recently.

 

In the past, Ulrich had said he would go to the hospital with her whenever he had time, and at the time, she didn’t think it would be too far off.

 

But that had not yet happened. Moreover, the idea seemed laughably distant now. She worried every morning when she saw the daily newspaper in her room.

 

Ulrich’s name was almost a public commodity in the recently published papers.

 

Every page mentioned him. As someone who shared his room, she saw a detailed breakdown of his daily schedule that even she wasn’t aware of.

 

Despite Gwen’s funeral being over, the attention towards Altahart had not waned. Instead, people were watching more closely, as the future pillar had perished. Business associates, acquaintances, and everyone who knew and remembered him in the Rechem Empire were keenly watching.

 

In other words, Ulrich was incredibly busy.

 

She couldn’t truthfully say she had no idea about his schedule. Ulrich left before she woke up and returned after she was asleep.

 

When he woke her for sex, it was never before midnight. It was an exhausting schedule that made it remarkable he still had the energy for sex.

 

Knowing his routine, asking him to make time to visit the hospital felt laughable. It was frustrating, but she had to be patient for now. The only consolation was that her letters were consistently disappearing.

 

“Are you crying…?”

 

A warm sensation settled on the back of her hand.

 

Startled, she looked up to see Noah gazing at her with trembling eyes. Realizing she had made the child anxious, Lisbell smiled as if nothing was wrong.

 

“No, I’m not crying.”

 

“But…”

 

“I just thought of my mother. I miss her.”

 

Noah blinked his wide eyes. Then, as if thinking of something, he pouted. His transparent eyes were quickly filled with tears.

 

“I also…”

 

“Huh?”

 

“Mommy…”

 

Lisbell was shocked and quickly hugged Noah. The words she had said to distract him had struck a chord.

 

It made sense that in this large mansion, with no one to look after him, it meant both his father and mother were absent. For such a young child, there was truly no one left.

 

“Sorry. I shouldn’t have said that.”

 

The child buried his face in her chest, shaking his head and sniffling. His thin clothes grew damp. The more she tried to comfort him, the more he seemed unable to control his emotions. Lisbell silently stroked the back of his head.

 

“I miss mommy…”

 

Noah mumbled, starting to sniffle.

 

“Hm?”

 

“Pendant, with her picture. Grandma…”

 

“Pendant?”

 

Lisbell pulled the clinging child back slightly to see his face. His face was already tear-stained. She wiped his blushing cheeks with her sleeve and calmly asked.

 

“Noah, tell me slowly. What do you mean?”

 

“Mommy gave me a pendant, with her picture…..”

 



 

“Grandma took it away…”


Chapter 78.



“Grandma… Mrs. Altahart?”

 

Noah barely answered with a teary voice. Lisbell pulled the small body closer to stop the child from crying. When it didn’t work, she gently lowered her head.

 

“Noah, should I bring you some nuts you like?”

 



 

“Drenched in honey.”

 

Noah’s little hands gripped Lisbell’s hem tightly. Even with a tear-streaked face, his eyes sparkled. Smiling at his innocent expression, she said, “I’ll bring them if you stop crying.”

 

Honey-drenched nuts were Noah’s favorite snack. As expected, it worked well. The child lifted his arm and rubbed his face.

 

“Wait here for a bit.”

 

She could have called someone, but she didn’t. She wasn’t part of this household and didn’t feel right using the servants’ care.

 

Lisbell walked down the corridor, waiting for a servant while mulling over the pendant Noah mentioned. Also, the image of Noah crying and wanting his mom lingered….

 

Mrs. Altahart confiscated it.

 

Could the child be separated from his birth mother because of their bloodline?

 

“Because Gwen’s child isn’t listed officially, his maternal blood linage is not great,” Ulrich had said in the past. If that was true, they should at least let him have the pendant. If they were going to be so irresponsible with his upbringing, the least they could do was….

 

“Lisbell?”

 

Julian Scott was who she met in the corridor while looking for a servant. He had just come into the mansion, his coat smelling of cold wind. He smiled at her with familiarity.

 

“Fancy meeting you here.”

 

It was a ridiculous greeting. They had always met in this mansion, so why the surprise?

 

“Hello.”

 

She couldn’t ignore him, so she responded briefly. As she turned to walk away, she heard a lukewarm chuckle behind her. Lisbell suddenly stopped.

 

“…Excuse me.”

 

Julian looked surprised. He seemed astonished that Lisbell, who he thought would just leave, had stopped.

 

“Yes?”

 

“Do you know anything about the pendant Mr.Gwen’s child had?”

 

“Pendant?”

 

“Yes. Mrs. Altahart confiscated it.”

 

Julian was the man closest to Mrs. Altahart, possibly even closer than Ulrich. That was Julian Scott right before her.

 

She couldn’t shake the feeling she was doing something unnecessary, but she couldn’t let it go.

 

“Not sure.”

 

Julian, who had taken a few steps closer, rubbed his chin. His mannerisms, like when he descended the stairs last time, were full of theatricality. She had heard he was an actor, but even knowing that, it felt awkward and stifling, like dealing with someone wearing a mask.

 

“Is it a special pendant?”

 

“It contains a portrait of his birth mother.”

 

“A portrait of his birth mother. Then, Mrs. Altahart probably took it because she couldn’t stand the sight of it… it might be in that box.”

 

“Box?”

 

“Have you ever been in Mrs. Altahart’s bedroom?”

 

“Of course not….”

 

His confident question made her more bewildered. On the other hand, his self-assurance was overwhelming. His remark implied he often entered Mrs. Altahart’s bedroom without caring.

 

“Well, the most extravagant place in this mansion is Mrs. Altahart’s bedroom.”

 

Why was he telling her this now? Lisbell cast a puzzled glance at him. Julian grinned as if to say, “Just listen.”

 

“There’s a box in that bedroom that doesn’t fit in. It’s a plain wooden box, not decorated with jewels or gold, making it conspicuous in its plainness.”

 

“…And?”

 

“If she confiscated the pendant, it’s probably in that box.”

 



 

“Mrs. Altahart has a habit of stashing things she hates to see in there.”

 

Though lengthy and verbose, his point was quite useful. She hadn’t expected much, so it was even more surprising. They weren’t close, yet he revealed this much, suggesting he wasn’t as ill-natured as he appeared.

 

Lisbell lowered her eyes. Noah’s traces remained on her clothes, his tear-streaked face and sorrowful cries lingering in her mind.

 

“Could you… check it for me?”

 

“Check it?”

 

“To see if the pendant is really in there….”

 

“My goodness, Lisbell. Do you even realize what you’re asking?”

 

Julian was horrified in an unexpected way. He talked about entering Mrs. Altahart’s bedroom without blinking, yet seemed deeply disturbed by the idea of opening the box.

 

“Is it that hard? Just to open a box?”

 

“Do you know Mrs. Altahart selects actors from the theater as her lovers?”

 

She didn’t know, but it felt wrong to interrupt, so she waited quietly.

 

“The man before me was my colleague, Beram. I learned about the box because he drunkenly babbled about it.”

 



 

“Beram was a favorite of Mrs. Altahart. He kept an eye on that box and eventually asked her about it. She told him it was for things she didn’t want to see. But Beram didn’t believe her. He was sure it was filled with treasures.”

 



 

“He was determined to check it out, though I didn’t think he’d actually do it. His position was too beneficial to risk angering her, especially as her favorite.”

 



 

“But he eventually touched the box.”

 



 

“I haven’t seen Beram since.”

 

“You haven’t… seen him?”

 

“He disappeared without a trace. No one in the mansion or the theater has seen him. He vanished like a puff of smoke.”

 

Lisbell was horrified.

 

“You mean… he’s dead?”

 

“Probably. Otherwise, there’s no reason for him to disappear so thoroughly.”

 

“Even so, would she kill someone just for opening her box?”

 

Julian laughed, almost mockingly. His gaze was filled with derision, as if looking at a fool.

 

“Don’t you get it?”

 

He raised an arm.

 

“These people.”

 

He circled his finger near his temple.

 

“They’re all completely insane.”

 

She had no rebuttal. Despite wanting to deny it, Lisbell had already experienced Ulrich firsthand. Her confrontation with her son suggested Mrs. Altahart wasn’t much different. Indeed, they had unusual aspects.

 

But could they really value human life so little? Did money truly make everything else insignificant? The sheer enormity of it made Lisbell’s heart tremble.

 

“Oh dear, I must go.”

 

Julian checked his pocket watch.

 

“Mrs. Altahart knows my theater schedule well. She probably knows I’m back by now.”

 

“…Thank you for answering my questions.”

 

Julian, who had been about to leave, gave a cryptic smile.

 

“A word of advice: if you get entangled with Mrs. Altahart, make sure you’re on her side.”

 

He leaned close to whisper softly in her ear.

 

“Mrs. Altahart is a very scary woman.”

 

Though no one was around, his hushed voice sent a shiver down her spine.


Chapter 79.


Lisbell caressed the rim of her ear where his breath had lingered, then took a step back. With a sly smile, Julian pocketed his pocket watch and turned to leave.

 

Standing alone in the hallway, Lisbell soon encountered a servant. When she requested honey-soaked nuts, the servant offered to bring them to the room, and she nodded, heading back to Noah’s room.

 

“Noah?”

 

As she opened the door and stepped inside, Noah quickly sat down. A quick glance revealed the desk in disarray. The neatly arranged letters and fountain pen were now scattered, indicating that Noah had been examining them in her absence.

 

“I, I didn’t look.”

 

“It’s okay, Noah.”

 

Perhaps due to the years spent in the mansion, the child seemed easily intimidated by the smallest matters. Lisbell gently patted his head to reassure him, and Noah hesitated before clinging to her.

 

As they resumed their interrupted lesson, there was a knock on the door, followed by the arrival of a servant with the requested snack: honey-soaked nuts.

 

“Is it good?”

 

“Yes….”

 

Noah eagerly accepted the treats she offered, sometimes grabbing some with his tiny hands and shyly offering them to Lisbell, who accepted them with a grateful smile.

 

As Noah continued to eat, his mouth grew sticky from the honey-covered nuts. Attempting to wipe his mouth with her sleeve, Lisbell realized it wouldn’t suffice and stood up quietly.

 

Heading to the bathroom to dampen a towel, she noticed a box poking out from under the bed, which seemed too big for Noah to handle alone.

 

“Noah, what’s this?”

 

Still engrossed in eating, Noah glanced over and quickly jumped down from his chair.

 

With small, hurried steps, Noah ran over, grabbed the box, and hugged it while shaking his head.

 

“It’s mine, it’s mine.”

 



 

“You can’t look….”

 

It seemed to be something like a treasure box for the child. Lisbell had seen children in orphanages often create such things. Regardless of age, each child had their own personality and deserved respect in such matters. Lisbell smiled and nodded.

 

“Okay, I won’t look.”

 

“Really…?”

 

“Of course. I won’t do anything Noah doesn’t like.”

 

Only then did Noah relax and lower the box from his arms.

 

While Lisbell went to the bathroom as planned, Noah tidied up the box and returned to the desk. Lisbell carefully wiped his sticky mouth with the dampened towel, glancing at the bed.

 

What could be in there to make him so protective?

 

The curiosity was brief. She had promised not to look, and she intended to keep her promise.

 

Lisbell shifted her gaze from the bed.

 

***

 

It was morning again.

 

Wrapped in soft bedding, Lisbell woke up to the rich aroma of coffee and lifted her head.

 

There was Ulrich, whom she had assumed had already left. Sipping coffee and reading the newspaper, he noticed her movement and greeted her with a gentle smile when their eyes met.

 

“Good morning.”

 

Blinking in disbelief at the surreal scene, Ulrich put down the newspaper and tenderly brushed her long, slender hair with his elegant fingers.

 

“Did you eat honey cake yesterday?”

 



 

“I smell something sweet in your hair.”

 

“I ate nuts.”

 

“Nuts, huh. Do you like those?”

 



 

“You have a child’s taste.”

 

As they continued their dreamy conversation, Lisbell gradually woke up. She sluggishly sat up, while Ulrich leisurely sipped his coffee, leaning against the bed’s headboard. Puzzled by his relaxed demeanor, she had to ask.

 

“Why are you in the bedroom today?”

 

“I have something to tell you.”

 

The nerves that had been relaxed suddenly tensed up. Could it be news about her mother? Seeing her eyes sharpen with focus, Ulrich chuckled and twisted a strand of her hair, his fingers moving like bees drawn to the sweetness.

 

“Let’s go on a date today.”

 

“Date…?”

 

“Let’s watch a play together this afternoon.”

 

She couldn’t understand the absurd suggestion.

 

While Lisbell was left speechless, Ulrich got up from the bed and approached the wardrobe. Humming, he looked through the blouses, skirts, and dresses he had bought in spare moments, finally selecting a white dress and hanging it on the mirror.

 

“Victor will choose and bring the accessories later.”

 

“Wait, hold on.”

 

“Yes.”

 

He turned around, looking leisurely as if wondering what the problem was. Lisbell, too stunned to even tidy her disheveled hair, just stared at him, then grabbed her forehead to pull herself together.

 

“A play?”

 

“It’s currently the most popular play in Laurent. It’s being staged at the theater my mother acquired.”

 

“Why are we going there….”

 

No, that wasn’t the point.

 

“If you have time to watch a play, I’d like to visit my mother.”

 

Yes, that was the crux of it.

 

She had asked to visit her mother so long ago. If he had time for a play, the hospital should obviously come first.

 

Reading Lisbell’s frustrated thoughts, Ulrich responded with folded arms.

 

“After the play.”

 



 

“If there’s time left after the play, we’ll go to the hospital together.”

 

“…Really?”

 

“Why would I lie?”

 

Lisbell gulped. His calm counter-question revealed no insincerity in his expression. It seemed almost indifferent as he toyed with the dress he had chosen.

 

Before long, there was a knock. Recognizing it as a summons for him, Ulrich glanced at his pocket watch and spoke.

 

“I was waiting to tell you this. I have to go now.”

 

“When… will you be back?”

 

He looked surprised at her unexpected question, then smiled like a spring breeze. Leaning over, he brought his face close.

 

“I like hearing that.”

 



 

“Will you wait for me?”

 

“…A promise is a promise.”

 

“Yes, a promise is a promise.”

 

His light laughter carried a transparent joy. Lisbell couldn’t return the smile. The weight of their meanings was different. He dreamed of watching a play, while she longed for a hospital visit, both clinging to the hollow promise of a date.

 

“I’ll come to pick you up. See you then.”

 

His lips settled on her forehead, rubbing gently before moving down to her lips. The urgent knock from outside sounded again. Ulrich, with a slight sigh of irritation, slipped his tongue smoothly into her mouth.

 

“Some people have no sense.”

 

Muttering to the secretary outside, Ulrich planted a final kiss on Lisbell’s lips and straightened his posture.

 

After securing his tie and adjusting his cufflinks, he left the bedroom.

 

Lisbell checked the time. Her heart thumped steadily. It was a different sensation from the desolate anxiety that usually dried her out.

 

She couldn’t believe she was anticipating his return for the first time this morning.

 

The play started well past noon.

 

Sitting beside Ulrich in the car, Lisbell awkwardly fiddled with the necklace around her neck. Not just the necklace, but the hair accessories, the long lace gloves on her arms, the silk stockings, and the high heels all felt uncomfortable.

 

“We’re almost there.”

 

As the driver reported, the car soon arrived at the theater.

 

As the engine quieted, the driver quickly stepped out to open the back door.

 

Ulrich got out first and extended his hand into the car. She wanted to ignore it, but it wouldn’t be wise to upset him. Today, of all days, she needed to be cautious, with the chance of visiting her mother so close.

 

Reluctantly, she took his hand, which he held firmly, more forceful than necessary for mere balance.


Chapter 80.


When both of them got out of the car, a person who appeared to be a theater staff member approached, greeted them, and led the way.

 

The interior was quiet as they climbed the stairs. According to the staff member, the performance had already started. As he said, the inside was intense with the stage lights, and the actors’ clear voices resonated poignantly.

 

The two were guided to the VIP seats on the second floor.

 

The VIP seats, which overlooked the stage, had a long sofa and velvet curtains installed on both sides of the railing.

 

Since the performance was in full swing, Lisbell sat down on the sofa carefully. Ulrich approached the railing, which was set up to prevent accidents, and drew the curtains aside to get a better view of the stage. Only then did he sit leisurely on the sofa, crossing his legs.

 

“Shall I get you some tea?”

 

Ulrich leaned his upper body towards her as he spoke. Lisbell looked back at him at the sudden suggestion. Their eyes met in the dim scenery, and he smiled serenely.

 

“You seem tense.”

 

“It’s okay.”

 

“Relax. It’s not your first time watching a play, right?”

 

Even if she wanted to, it was inevitable to be overwhelmed by the new scene. Moreover, with Ulrich sitting beside her in an uncomfortable environment, she couldn’t feel at ease.

 

“…It’s my first time coming to a theater.”

 

“First time? Really?”

 

“I’ve only seen small church plays until now.”

 

“Small church plays. Haha, that’s cute.”

 

Saying so, Ulrich wrapped his arm around her waist. His well-shaped lips settled on her temple and gently rubbed against it.

 

“The scent is gone.”

 



 

“That’s a shame. You should’ve let it linger a bit longer.”

 



 

“It wasn’t bad having my nose buried in the back of your head while swaying your waist.”

 

He buried his nose once more and sniffed.

 

Lisbell frowned slightly and pushed him away. Even though the lights were off and only the stage was visible, it was a public place, and she couldn’t know when someone might look. Being caught in such an act with him would be quite embarrassing.

 

He should be the one to be more careful. These days, he was a famous person whose name appeared in the newspapers every day. Yet, acting so recklessly was incomprehensible to her. He was a man who, while seemingly fulfilling his duties responsibly, would become indulgent and lascivious without warning.

 

“If it’s your first time at a theater…”

 

Ulrich lifted Lisbell’s wrist, which was pushing against his chest. His even teeth bit the lace gloves covering her fingers and began to take them off. His face, partially illuminated by the light from afar, emitted a dangerous aura.

 

“You must not have had sex in a theater either.”

 

“…You said we were here to watch a play.”

 

“Technically, I said we were here for a date.”

 



 

“You know what a date means, right?”

 



 

“A time for a man and a woman to get to know each other intimately.”

 

Her nervous heart sank as he moved down to the floor. Ulrich’s broad shoulders partially obscured her view. The outer coat draped in the light streaming from outside the railing cast a fearsome backlight.

 

“…Huek…!”

 

He grabbed Lisbell’s trembling knee firmly. With his long index and middle fingers, he leisurely stroked the bony part, playfully lifting the fluttering hem of her skirt.

 

“Ulrich.”

 

“Shh.”

 



 

“Let’s make this a special experience.”

 

Ignoring her attempts to dissuade him, Ulrich lifted her soft clothing. The insides of her thighs, spread wide with the triangle between them, were exposed above her knobbly knees.

 

Even though her underwear wasn’t off, the realization that this wasn’t their usual bedroom but an outdoor VIP seat in a theater, where anyone could come in, filled her with shame. She could feel the heat gathering on her foot, wrapped in the strap of her shoe.

 

“Ulrich…!”

 

“I’d rather you call my name when you moan.”

 

He chuckled in the darkness, partially revealing his face. The man’s breath brushed against her leg, making her shoulders hunch involuntarily.

 

Ulrich brought his soft cheek to her inner thigh. His delicate lips made a sucking sound as they kissed her tender skin, moving upwards. He then reached her still-covered vulva.

 

“Ugh.”

 

Lisbell covered her lips with the back of her hand. Her eyes moved anxiously. Even though it was dark and only the stage lights shone, it felt as if she were being watched, making her limbs freeze.

 

Sensing Lisbell’s tension, Ulrich laughed softly and rubbed his nose against her central part. Even with the thin underwear in between, his high nose and occasional long breaths stimulated her senses sharply.

 

“Wait… Ah…”

 

Ulrich finally brought out his tongue. His reddish tongue licked the fabric-covered hole. Seen in the partial backlight, it looked like the lethal tongue of a snake.

 

Lisbell’s hips twitched as she grabbed Ulrich’s shoulders.

 

His tongue moved so diligently that the thin fabric got soaked helplessly. It felt as if it wasn’t his saliva but her own arousal making it wet.

 

“Ugh…”

 

She repeatedly tried to push his shoulders away. However, Ulrich only moved his head closer, concentrating on licking the outline of her vulva. He sometimes buried his nose and nibbled with his whole lips, making Lisbell’s fingers lose strength helplessly.

 

“Even licking through the clothes feels good.”

 

“Ugh…”

 

“Your hole is really soft.”

 

Ulrich, praising her as if she were praiseworthy, finally slipped his hand under her skirt.

 

The feeling of her underwear being removed planted an unprecedented sense of alertness. Lisbell, who had been reaching out to stop him, froze as she glanced at the stage below.

 

Julian Scott was on stage. The lover of Mrs. Altahart.

 

Oh, right, he said he was a member of the troupe.

 

She hadn’t cared about the troupe, but it turned out to be the one performing the play they were watching today.

 

If she had simply watched him perform, she wouldn’t have felt so shocked.

 

For a moment, she felt as if she had made eye contact with Julian.

 

That couldn’t be. Unlike her unobstructed view of the stage, the backlight would prevent the actors from seeing the audience.

 

Yet… Julian Scott, continuing his performance, didn’t turn his head, as if he could clearly see her.

 

To others, it might have looked like part of his stage presence, but to Lisbell, it wasn’t. She remembered the ambiguous smile he had given her whenever they met at the mansion.

 

“Ah…!”

 

While her mind was distracted, her underwear was removed and thrown aside. Lisbell tried to get up from the sofa, but Ulrich swiftly grabbed her ankle and lifted it. He placed her left leg over his shoulder and angled her right leg on the sofa’s armrest, bringing his tongue eagerly to her exposed vulva.

 

“Ung!”

 

Lisbell quickly covered her mouth with her hand. She could hear the sticky sucking sound below.

 

An embarrassing sensation climbed up her bare skin.

 

The tongue that had been busy through her clothes was now greedily licking her bare skin. The entrance was quickly moistened, sending shivers down her inner passage. Ulrich seemed determined to raise her sensitivity quickly, softly parting her labia and sucking on the protruding clitoris.

 

“Ugh, wait… Ulrich…!”

 

The stimulation was relentless, leaving her no escape as his lips fully enveloped her. Each sweep of his tongue over her clitoris sent a ticklish thrill through her.

 

Lisbell moaned like a cat and threw her head back. Julian Scott’s voice still echoed in her ears, twisting her insides strangely. It felt as if she were not the spectator but the one being watched, exposing scenes she shouldn’t to him, making her mind flicker on and off.


Chapter 81.

“Haah, huh… uh…!”

 

Ulrich mischievously bit the reddish clitoris while quietly moving his fingers. Soon, his middle finger plunged deep inside. He ruthlessly ravaged Lisbell’s lower body, poking at the tight inner walls that wrapped around him.

 

Under the influence of his caress, her rationality quickly crumbled. She knew she had to keep her composure, but it was impossible.

 

Barely managing to straighten her head, which had been helplessly rubbing against the backrest, her eyes met Julian’s on the stage once again. It was as if he was really looking this way. The fixed gaze made her inner thighs twitch and convulse. Another rush of liquid poured out.

 

“Haah, you’re dripping like crazy.”

 

“Huh… uh…”

 

“Do you like doing it here so much? Do you get more excited thinking someone might see us?”

 

He commented, pinching her n!pple through her clothes, showing a subtly perverted side. Pressing his body against hers, Ulrich’s entire body stuck to her trembling form.

 

A massive something brushed against and rubbed against her exposed skin. The silhouette of his erect cock, visible through his right thigh, was intimidating. Ulrich, too, was aroused as he licked between her legs.

 

His bulging flesh, full of blood, was protruding so much it seemed like it might burst through his pants. Even though he was clothed, the friction felt as if it was bare skin rubbing against her.

 

Standing up straight, he swallowed Lisbell’s confused lips while leisurely unbuttoning his pants. With a few gestures, his trousers were pulled down, and his erect shaft sprang out, bare and exposed.

 

Grasping it in his palm, he gently stroked it up and down, causing it to twitch dramatically. His pen!s, looking like a living entity, was soon at the entrance of Lisbell’s hole. With a slow, twisting motion of his hips, he penetrated smoothly, meeting no resistance.

 

“Ah… huh…!”

 

“Haah…”

 

As it plunged in up to the root, heavy breaths burst from both of their mouths.

 

Ulrich, marveling at the soft inner texture that made his whole body relax, buried his face in her chest and slowly began to move his hips.

 

Squeak. Squeak.

 

The poorly constructed VIP seat sofa, incomparable to a bed, made a grating noise. Despite her wide-open lower body, Lisbell’s eyes widened in embarrassment at the sound.

 

Ulrich chuckled, lightly shifting their positions.

 

“Uh…!”

 

Now Lisbell was sitting on top of him, leaning against the backrest. Facing away from the stage for the first time, Lisbell couldn’t hide her confusion at the new position.

 

“Why… why…”

 

“This way, it will be quieter.”

 



 

“You’re not fine moaning and groaning while being penetrated by me, right? You don’t like it.”

 

He lightly shut her mouth, sweeping his sweaty forehead back, and slapped her buttocks that were perched on his thigh.

 

“Try rotating your hips.”

 



 

“This way, it will be quieter than if I moved.”

 

Indeed, the more men indulged in pleasure, the less they held back. If she made such noises here, not only the stage but the guests in the VIP seats on both sides would know exactly what they were doing.

 

Lisbell, her complexion pale, reached out.

 

Grabbing his shoulder with difficulty, Ulrich positioned himself so she could move her hips more easily.

 

As he moved, the object inside shifted direction, poking at her tender spots. She had to bite her lip hard to suppress the reflexive moans.

 

Biting down hard enough to draw blood, she timidly started to move her hips. Holding onto his shoulders was too burdensome, so she moved her hands to the backrest and wiggled her hips slightly.

 

Even if she didn’t want to, the sensation of the shaft parting her flesh caused her hole to shiver on its own. Lisbell’s awkwardly rotated pelvis frowned, as if she was rolling in pain rather than engaging in an act of pleasure.

 

“Ah, as I thought, this outfit suits you well, Lisbell.”

 

“Huh, uh…”

 

“I thought it would feel amazing to see you riding on top of me in this dress.”

 

He lifted the hem of her white lace dress, pulling her hips towards him. The deepening connection made Lisbell’s pupils quiver weakly.

 

Ulrich, throwing a savage gaze that seemed to want to lick her entire iris, grabbed her buttocks tightly. With the pen!s lodged inside, every squeeze of her buttocks caused the vaginal walls to be scraped.

 

The creepy, electrifying sensation of her lower abdomen being torn apart heated her entire body. As she moaned and bent her waist inward, Ulrich supported her from behind, pulling her closer and whispering.

 

“Doesn’t it look like a wedding dress?”

 

“Huh…”

 

Ulrich made her lean on him completely, grabbing Lisbell’s buttocks with both hands. Then, he fiercely thrust his hips, which had been still until now.

 

“Huh, ah! …Uh!”

 

With the sudden rapid movements, Lisbell had to bury her lips in his shoulder to suppress her scream-like moans. Unable to endure any longer, she ended up biting his shoulder. Clinging on for dear life, her gums throbbed painfully. She looked like someone being tortured rather than engaging in sex.

 

Ulrich enjoyed the peculiar sensation of his flesh-covered shoulder being bitten, thrusting his lower body deeply.

 

Each time he thrust deeply, it felt as if his entire shaft would be swallowed to the base. The smooth suction offered no resistance. Regardless of the owner’s psychological state, the interior was unbelievably seductive.

 

In the artificially darkened space, their entwined bodies never ceased to move. Two shadows falling on the floor, trembling like candles in the wind, painted the walls.

 

The narrow VIP room heated up with their fervor.

 

Lisbell couldn’t withstand the constant thrusting inside, sliding down helplessly. Ulrich, not missing the opportunity, switched their positions again.

 

Lisbell’s small back collided with the sofa backrest.

 

“Haa…!”

 

“Right?”

 

“Uh, uh…! Uh…!”

 

“This position suits us best.”

 

They returned to the initial position. Lisbell leaning against the sofa, with Ulrich on top, occupying the space between her legs, conducting the sex.

 

After removing his bothersome pants, exposing his cleanly shaved genitals, he thrust faster. Lisbell’s wet pubic hair clung to his lower body. Ulrich smirked, enjoying the traces of their union.

 

“This, really, huh, feels good, you know?”

 

“Huh, uh, ah…!”

 

“Your hair wrapping around my body… ah… haah.”

 

The pleasure from his relentless thrusting seemed to overflow, making his voice raspy. His heavy groans, like those of a beast, echoed.

 

Squeak, squeak, squeak.

 

The sofa started to groan again from the relentless pounding. But now, Lisbell had no strength to stop him. Holding onto his shoulders, she was overwhelmed by the overwhelming pleasure spreading from her insides.

 

“Huh, huh, uh…!”

 

All she could do was bite her tongue to stifle her moans. Staring blankly into space, struggling to keep her cries from escaping, her vision blurred.

 

As the position changed, Julian, who had been out of sight, came back into view.

 

Just then, Julian, who was looking towards the central seats, spread his arms wide and fixed his gaze on them again. The wave of shame rose from her chest and surged high.

 

“Ugh… uh… huh…!”

 

Closing her eyes tightly, the thunderous pleasure pounding her insides struck harder. Unable to escape, her eyes grew hot with tears.

 

Lisbell grabbed his shoulders, turning her head away as if to hide.

 

Her chin was immediately grasped. The face she barely managed to hide was forcibly returned to its original position.

 

“Since earlier, haah… what are you so concerned about?”

 

Displaying a waist movement that seemed to exude the scent of a horny male, Ulrich stuck out his tongue. He leisurely licked the moisture collecting at the corner of Lisbell’s eyes and laughed.

 

“Julian Scott?”

Chapter 82

At that moment, Lisbell’s fingers tightened so much that they turned pitifully pale. Her gaze, which had been deliberately distant, hurriedly returned to him. She didn’t even realize she was taking a very suspicious posture due to the sudden onslaught.

 

Facing her up close, Ulrich suddenly pulled her limp legs. He wrapped her slender thighs around his waist and pressed their lower bodies together as one.

 

Feeling the simultaneous pressure on her organs and the resulting sexual arousal, Lisbell frowned as if in pain.

 

“Making friends isn’t bad, but…”

 

“Ah…!”

 

He embraced her hips and lowered her to the floor. Both of them quickly fell beneath the sofa, out of sight of the stage.

 

“You should know how to choose your friends.”

 

In the darkness, skillfully avoiding the light, Lisbell looked up at him with difficulty.

 

His eyes, half-buried in shadows, were entirely black and somehow chilling. An unknown tension seemed to spread through every corner of her being.

 

Before she could ask what he meant, Ulrich placed her legs over his shoulders. Her lower body was pulled tight, and he pressed his organ against an even deeper point.

 

“Behave yourself.”

 

“Hnn…!”

 

“If you make friends with just anyone, you’ll get in real trouble.”

 

Soon, a loud, slapping sound resounded as he thrust strongly. Though he said that, it felt as if a severe punishment had already begun.

 

It was uneasy yet pleasurable, futile yet stimulating.

 

The unpredictable intercourse felt like being beaten.

 

***

 

Thankfully, the curtain call was long.

 

If it weren’t, they wouldn’t have been able to get dressed and put on their scattered accessories properly. They wouldn’t have been able to leave the VIP section on time after the play.

 

Exhausted, Lisbell sat on the sofa, swallowing her still-excited breath. Ulrich stood behind her, tying her messy ash-gray hair into a single ponytail. Making a neat ribbon with the tie, he sat down next to her.

 

Meanwhile, the curtain call ended. The red curtain came down like a wave, covering the stage. Lights gradually came back on. A bustling noise arose from the seats below, indicating people were preparing to leave.

 

“Let’s go too.”

 

Following Ulrich, Lisbell got up from the sofa.

 

As soon as she took a step, she stumbled. Her legs, still not fully recovered, gave her trouble. Fortunately, Ulrich, watching her, turned and caught her in his arms.

 

She needed to straighten her back but couldn’t. Biting her lip at the discomfort in her skirt, she felt the remnants of his climax, which he had done several times between her thin waist and thighs, running down one leg despite her efforts to clean up.

 

As she stood still, looking down awkwardly, Ulrich, seemingly understanding the reason, chuckled and lowered himself leisurely, taking a handkerchief from his jacket.

 

“Did I come too much?”

 

He nonchalantly lifted her skirt, letting her hold it, and wiped away his traces with the handkerchief.

 

Though it seemed he was cleaning her for hygiene, there was a subtle malice in his touch. There was no need to brush against her underwear, but his hand deliberately touched that area, lingering before pulling away.

 

Putting the handkerchief away, Ulrich smiled as if savoring the sight of Lisbell, who had stumbled like a fawn moments before.

 

“I’ve given you a special experience.”

 



 

“When will you ever have weak knees in a theater again?”

 

Too drained to respond, Lisbell quietly let down her skirt. He wrapped his arm around her waist, leading her out of the VIP section.

 

“Mr. Altahart?”

 

Unlike the noisy atmosphere below, the exit for the VIP section was quiet. As they approached the stairs they had climbed earlier, someone called out to Ulrich. It was an elderly gentleman in a fedora.

 

“Mr. Bates.”

 

Familiar with him, Ulrich readily shook the extended hand. His smile was formal and polite but nothing more. Thinking he might be a business partner, Lisbell stepped back and bowed her head.

 

“You must be here for the play too, Mr. Bates.”

 

“My wife loves theater, so I always try to make time for it once a week. But I’m surprised to see you here, Mr. Altahart.”

 

“Do I not seem like the type to enjoy such leisure?”

 

Mr. Bates quickly shook his head.

 

“Not at all. But isn’t today the opening of the Schwaben Art Museum exhibition? I thought you’d be there.”

 

“Why would I be there?”

 

“I met the Schwaben curator at the Foylewood family’s charity event the other day. He mentioned that you were planning to attend the exhibition, so I assumed you’d be there.”

 

Ulrich smiled knowingly.

 

Indeed, while this play was being performed, the Schwaben Art Museum exhibition was also in full swing.

 

If Daphne had spread the word that he would attend, it would only be to his advantage.

 

Thinking of Daphne, who was always overly optimistic, he pulled Lisbell closer.

 

Suddenly drawn to his side, Lisbell tensed her toes in surprise. But the lingering aftereffects of their intimacy, coupled with his overpowering grip, made her cling to his side.

 

Naturally, Mr. Bates’ gaze shifted to her.

 

“The curator must have been mistaken.”

 

Ulrich deliberately caressed Lisbell’s waist.

 

“I had a prior engagement today.”

 

His tone was factual yet intentionally suggestive. Mr. Bates, falling into the trap, brightened his eyes and looked at Lisbell from head to toe with curiosity.

 

Soon, he lowered his fedora and winked.

 

“I must have interrupted a private date.”

 

Leaving a courteous farewell, Mr. Bates quickly departed. Ulrich watched him whisper something to his waiting wife, smiling in satisfaction.

 

Word would spread quickly that Ulrich had attended the theater with Lisbell, a stranger to society.

 

This would create a small obstacle for his mother, who was hastily arranging his engagement. Remembering the faces of the two women who had plotted against him, he turned his steps.

 

However, leaving wasn’t easy. Known faces in the VIP section repeatedly called and stopped him. Each time, he subtly kept Lisbell by his side, attracting their gazes.

 

As people gathered, talk of the latest business matters emerged, making the dreary VIP corridor even more serious than a hotel meeting room.

 

Ulrich, surrounded by this group, glanced sideways. Lisbell, caught with him, looked incredibly tired.

 

Making a gesture of excuse to the one speaking to him, he leaned down and whispered in her ear.

 

“Go down ahead.”

 

Lisbell, wanting that, nodded slightly and started down the stairs. Outside, the wind gently brushed her cheeks, clearing her mind.

 

Rubbing her flushed cheeks with her hand, Lisbell saw the driver approaching. Bowing, he led her towards the car.

 

“Lisbell?”

 

Just as she tiredly followed, she heard her name from afar.

Chapter 83.


In this capital city, where she had no connections, the woman’s delicate voice sounded even more out of place. Lisbell instinctively turned her head. And there, she saw a woman holding up her dress in a rather rough manner to get into a car.

 

The woman had luscious red hair that seemed capable of dimming even the distant sunset. Her blinking eyes were a fresh, vibrant green.

 

There was only one person in Lisbell’s memory who adorned herself with such vivid colors.

 

“Bianca…?”

 

Lisbell was just as taken aback.

 

She never expected to run into someone she knew, even slightly, from Laurent.

 

“Oh my! Oh my, oh my.”

 

Bianca quickly withdrew her foot from the car. Then, in a flash, she dashed over to Lisbell. She wore high heels under her fluttering dress, yet she didn’t stumble once, just as Lisbell remembered.

 

“Lisbell! It’s really you, Lisbell?”

 

“Bianca, what are you doing here…?”

 

“I was dragged here by my mother, hoping to find a suitable husband! It was so boring I couldn’t even yawn. I would have rather been horse riding.”

 

Even now, she was as strong-willed as ever.

 

Despite that, Lisbell couldn’t quite believe it and stared blankly at Bianca, who was gripping her hand tightly.

 

Bianca was the only daughter of the Count of Cliquemont. Lisbell had taught her briefly during her university vacations, introduced by Theodore.

 

Since Lisbell last saw her, Bianca had grown into a mature lady.

 

“And you, Lisbell? Why are you here? I never dreamed we would meet in Laurent!”

 

“I… have my reasons…”

 

“Reasons?”

 

Bianca tilted her head. Lisbell’s lips felt heavy. Seeing her innocent face brought back old memories that were hard to confront. At the end of those memories was her irreversible breakup with Theodore.

 

“How’s Theo doing?”

 

Lisbell’s heart pounded fiercely since their encounter, fearing Bianca would mention him.

 

And now, in this unavoidable reality, Lisbell’s mind went blank. Her mouth was dry, and her tongue felt rough, a typical reaction of someone at a loss for words.

 

“You two were supposed to get married after graduation. I was so disappointed I couldn’t attend the wedding!”

 

Bianca was unusually open-minded for a noble. She valued essence over the dignity high-borns cherished, often worrying her parents with her rebellious nature. 

 

Her parents even wrote a regretful letter explaining that Bianca couldn’t attend their prearranged wedding, fearing she’d see something untoward and develop an unhealthy curiosity. In hindsight, it was a miracle Lisbell had been allowed to teach her at all.

 

“Theo and I… broke off our engagement.”

 

“Broke off the engagement?”

 

Bianca’s voice grew louder.

 

“Why? Did something happen?”

 

Lisbell clammed up again. Bianca rolled her eyes, pondering.

 

“Now that I think about it, I recently heard news about Theo from my father. So, naturally, I assumed you’d be…”

 

“News?”

 

It had been a long time since Lisbell had ended the engagement and left her tearful fiancé at the Marnia villa. She hadn’t heard anything about Theodore since then, intentionally or otherwise.

 

Knowing she had ruined their relationship with her stubbornness, Theodore’s memory remained a painful shard in her heart.

 

Thinking of him always brought pain. So she avoided any news about him.

 

Yet, curiosity flared up now, driven by Bianca’s proximity to Theodore. It was unlikely she’d relay incorrect information. Lisbell couldn’t help but listen intently to what Bianca might say.

 

Bianca was about to speak.

 

“Lisbell.”

 

Arms wrapped around her waist from behind. She took a few steps back in her small-heeled shoes, colliding with a firm body. Bianca’s gaze shifted from Lisbell to Ulrich, who had whispered, “Couldn’t find the car?”

 

It was a gentle reprimand for not being in the car yet. Ulrich’s eyes, having looked at Lisbell, soon turned to Bianca. Lisbell nervously clenched her fingers.

 

“Alta… Hart?”

 

Bianca, looking startled, glanced back and forth between Ulrich and Lisbell. She seemed unable to fathom their connection.

 

“Are you two…”

 

Ulrich, not recognizing her, squinted. Having received some social education during her coming-of-age ceremony, Bianca quickly straightened up, composed herself, and smiled.

 

“Hello, I’m Bianca Cliquemont.”

 

“Ah, the young lady of Cliquemont. So, that’s Lady Cliquemont back there.”

 

Back there?

 

Bianca turned to look.

 

Her mother, waiting in the car, had finally lost patience and was getting out. Her expression was fierce. Gasping, Bianca hurriedly said, “I forgot my mother was waiting in the car. It was an honor to chat, but I must go…!”

 

Bianca glanced back as she hurried to the car. Lisbell couldn’t decipher her intent. The car carrying Bianca soon smoothly left the theater.

 

“Let’s go.”

 

Lisbell thought Ulrich might ask how she knew Bianca, but he simply guided her to their car. He seemed oddly hurried.

 

When they reached the waiting car, he personally opened the back door for her.

 

Before getting in, Lisbell looked up at him to confirm if they were still going to the hospital. Ulrich, already watching her, met her eyes.

 

He gave a suspicious smile.

 

“I’m sorry. You’ll have to go back to the mansion alone.”

 

“What?”

 

“Something urgent came up that I must attend to right away.”

 

Lisbell grabbed his arm before he could close the door.

 

“What do you mean? What about the hospital… seeing my mother?”

 



 

“You promised. You said you’d visit the hospital after the play…!”

 

“Lisbell.”

 

He leaned closer, lowering his voice. Lisbell flinched, feeling as if he was physically covering her mouth.

 

Ulrich always had a way of overwhelming others without raising his voice. Though often smiling, his formality made his lack of expression unnerving.

 

And now, Ulrich was not smiling.

 

“Don’t raise your voice.”

 



 

“I don’t want others to think we’re arguing.”

 

He pulled her waist close. Their eye contact was sharp, like rubbing against broken glass, but to others, it might seem affectionate.

 

He leaned in as if to kiss her, but Lisbell turned her face away, making his lips brush her cheek.

 

She couldn’t react because she noticed onlookers nearby, still mingling outside the theater.

 

Finally, she understood why Ulrich was so cautious.


Chapter 84.


“…It’s a relief there are no reporters here.”

 

“If they were, they would have shoved their cameras in our faces to capture this scene.”

 



 

“Luckily, the theater’s security is pretty strict, isn’t it?”

 

Even with his sarcastic comment about being conscious of others’ eyes, the man grinned even wider. Lisbell glared at him and pushed his arm off her waist. Ulrich, of course, did not budge. Instead, he pulled her closer and kissed her defiantly.

 

She could feel the sharp gazes from all directions cutting into her skin. Her entire body froze with tension. A bleak premonition struck her, suggesting she might have to endure such awkward situations countless times in the capital and while staying close to this man.

 

“And…is there something you’re hiding from me?”

 

At this point, the small spark of doubt had grown into a tinder capable of pricking at something significant.

 

She still believed that provoking Ulrich wouldn’t bring her any benefits. However, the missed opportunity to meet her mother, which she had been looking forward to, made it unbearable to remain silent.

 

No matter how busy he was, couldn’t he at least stop by for a moment since he was here? It now seemed much more plausible that he was hiding something from her.

 

Maybe he was doing it deliberately….

 

“Well.”

 



 

“Do we need to share everything between us?”

 

Lisbell’s eye twitched. Ulrich had lifted her cheek with his hand. Distracted by his gesture, it took her a moment to comprehend his words. But before she could fully process them, Ulrich diffused the situation with a carefree laugh.

 

“I was joking.”

 



 

“Today’s events were really unexpected. While talking with other guests inside, I realized there was an urgent matter to check on. Victor will be here with the car soon, and we have to leave immediately.”

 

His detailed explanation made sense logically, but still… her heart felt uneasy and uncomfortable.

 

Yet, having doubts didn’t provide any solutions. She couldn’t stir up a commotion here by arguing with him, nor could she leave without Ulrich and head to the hospital alone.

 

A bitter sense of helplessness swallowed her whole.

 

Lisbell lowered her head. Ulrich patted her hair gently before kissing her temple.

 

The next moment, she was forced into the car by the weight on her shoulder.

 

As the door closed and the space was sealed off, Lisbell looked at Ulrich standing outside through the moving car window. Moments later, the car left the theater grounds, heading not toward the hospital, but toward the mansion.

 

“Do we need to share everything between us?”

 

Those cruel words echoed like those of a spiteful poet.

 

She couldn’t just sit still like this. She had to find out something. Ulrich had said there would be no issues with her mother unless otherwise contacted by the attendant at the hospital, but there could be some falsehoods in his words.

 

Or perhaps everything could be a lie.

 

What part should she believe? 

 

What part should she doubt?

 

Holding her forehead, Lisbell closed her eyes tightly.

 

Over her muddled thoughts, Bianca’s voice, which she had set aside for a while, floated up.

 

“Come to think of it, I remember hearing news about Theo from father recently. So naturally, Lisbell, you must also…”

 

News.

 

What news was it?

 

And do I even have the right to be curious about it?

 

Piling one doubt on top of another would only leave her treading in place.

 

She simply didn’t know.

 

What was she clinging to right now?

 

And what exactly did she want to give up?

 

In a life filled with questions, she had become accustomed to the bitter taste of self-reproach.

 

***

 

Afterward, Lisbell returned to her usual routine.

 

Teaching Noah, writing letters to her mother in her spare time, and being embraced like a straw doll by Ulrich’s arms that returned only at dawn, shaking her limbs. Just when the theater visit began to feel like a brief deviation from her daily life, unexpected news reached Lisbell.

 

“How do you know Miss Cliquemont?”

 

Ulrich, who had been playing with her chest absently, suddenly withdrew his hand and asked.

 

It was curious why this question, which hadn’t come up on the day they visited the theater but several days later, arrived now. Wanting to grasp his true intention, but feeling sluggish all over, it was hard for her to turn and read his expression.

 

Lisbell stared at the wall and spoke.

 

“I used to teach her briefly.”

 

“You did?”

 

“Yes.”

 

“Hmm… That’s unexpected.”

 



 

“Did the Cliquemont family really have such an open mind?”

 

Ulrich, who had gotten off the bed, took out a cigarette.

 

Even though the lights weren’t on, the moonlight streaming in through the window brightly illuminated his face. The shadows cast in the right places made his profile resemble a sculpture meticulously crafted by many hands.

 

Watching him light the cigarette, Lisbell let out a tired sigh.

 

“They are similar to you. But… there was no teacher available for Bianca in the capital, which was the problem.”

 

She quickly understood what Ulrich was puzzled about.

 

No matter how advanced perceptions became and how weakened the power of social hierarchy was, the world was still fundamentally structured around classes.

 

Nobles lived in the world of nobles, and commoners in the world of commoners. It was still rare for someone to cross that firm boundary. Hence, it was indeed extraordinary for a commoner like Lisbell to have temporarily taught the daughter of a count in the capital.

 

“Come to think of it, wasn’t the daughter of that family notorious for being quite a tomboy?”

 

So they weren’t completely unfamiliar; he had at least heard some rumors.

 

As Ulrich mentioned, Bianca was still unruly now but was even more so in the past. Though she was born into nobility, she was more focused on exploring her curiosities rather than adhering to the virtues expected of a young lady.

 

Because of this, she often clashed with the tutors her parents had hired. Tutors who couldn’t handle Bianca’s fiery nature would quickly resign, leading to a frequent turnover at the Cliquemont household.

 

But that approach didn’t last long.

 

There were no more tutors left in the capital willing to take on Bianca, and the rumors about her made others wary of teaching her.

 

Nonetheless, they couldn’t just abandon her education.

 

In a rapidly changing world, knowledge remained the unshakable foundation and truth, serving as a weapon for the future.

 

Thus, Count Cliquemont, desperate to ensure his daughter’s education, discussed the matter with Mr. Motier, a factory owner from Renbruck who was visiting their mansion.

 

The two had maintained a friendship from previous business dealings and were well acquainted with each other’s families. Knowing Mr. Motier’s son, Theodore, was attending university in Misley, Count Cliquemont inquired if he knew any suitable teachers.

 

Knowing Theodore’s character, he was eager to entrust him with the task, but his daughter was unmarried and a noble. Having a male tutor for an underage noble girl was unthinkable in the capital.

 

Hearing this, Theodore introduced Lisbell, who was looking for something to occupy her upcoming vacation. Concerned about the rumors that might arise from a commoner teaching a noble, the lessons were conducted at a separate villa owned by the Cliquemont’s maternal side in a foreign country.

 

Though previous tutors had fled in horror, the two got along unexpectedly well.

 

Lisbell, being a commoner, was more lenient towards Bianca’s unruly nature, which had previously terrified other tutors. Initially wary of Lisbell, Bianca gradually opened up to her as she accepted her unconditionally.


Chapter 85.


As Lisbell got to know Bianca, she felt sorrowful, thinking that Bianca seemed trapped in the superficial label of nobility. Though Bianca had a genuine heart, the world of the capital and high society only highlighted her background and appearance.

 

Realizing that Bianca was stressed about this, Lisbell always listened to her sincerely and empathized with her.

 

Before parting, Lisbell encouraged Bianca, emphasizing that one’s background is innate and can’t be discarded, hoping Bianca would find a way to live well by making appropriate concessions and compromises in that world.

 

When they met again, Bianca seemed to have found the answer. Although they had a brief conversation at the theater, it was clear Bianca had become adept at compromising where necessary.

 

“But why did Bianca suddenly….”

 

Ulrich lowered the cigarette held between his lips as Lisbell softly asked.

 

Exhaling a puff of smoky breath, he crossed his legs and held something barely visible in one hand.

 

“Lady Cliquemont sent an invitation addressed to you.”

 

“…What?”

 

“She wants to invite you to a tea party in a few days.”

 

“How could that…”

 

“She saw me with you the other day. Maybe she sent it here, hoping I’d pass it on.”

 



 

“I found it amusing. Seeing her act so recklessly, the rumors of her being a wild girl aren’t unfounded…. You can sense the Cliquemont couple’s struggles.”

 

As he sat on the bed, Ulrich handed the invitation to Lisbell. Hesitantly, Lisbell took it. While she quietly read the invitation, Ulrich leisurely smoked his cigarette.

 

Occasionally, he would twist Lisbell’s waist-length hair around his fingers. After about five times of this playful act, Lisbell raised her head.

 

“But I can’t go there.”

 

“Why?”

 

“Because… I’m not a noble.”

 

A tea party.

 

Just hearing it made her feel as though her whole body was being pricked. It was clearly not a place for someone like her. Despite liking Bianca, Lisbell felt a bit resentful about receiving such an invitation.

 

However, in a way, it was just like Bianca. She wasn’t a high-nosed noble who drew lines based on class. Of course, she sent the invitation believing it wouldn’t be an issue for Lisbell to attend.

 

“Shall I go with you then?”

 

“…What?”

 

“You seem like you want to go.”

 



 

“If you’re with me, there’s no need to worry about lacking qualifications.”

 

Indeed, in the capital, the name Altahart was like a passport to enter anywhere. If she was with him, Lisbell could go anywhere, regardless of being a commoner or even a pauper.

 

Moreover, snippets of Bianca’s words drifted back to Lisbell’s mind.

 

“Come to think of it, I remember hearing news about Theo through my father recently.”

 

She knew she should forget, but the human heart isn’t that simple. If it were, life wouldn’t be so burdensome.

 

She wanted to hear the rest of the conversation interrupted by Ulrich’s appearance. For that, she needed to meet Bianca again, but the difficulty of arranging such a meeting turned it into a quietly held personal wish.

 

Yet, the opportunity had come on its own.

 

An unknown curiosity swelled in her heart, making it beat faster. However, she couldn’t easily agree because of Ulrich’s unclear proposal.

 

Going to an unknown person’s invitation, simply because she wanted to?

 

He wasn’t such a considerate man.

 

Unless he had another motive….

 

“Your gaze is intimidating.”

 



 

“You’re looking at me with suspicion.”

 

His tone, knowing full well yet asking, was equally dubious. Ulrich laughed as he lightly kissed the back of Lisbell’s hand.

 

“It’s my way of apologizing.”

 

“Apology?”

 

“I couldn’t visit your mother the last time.”

 



 

“This time, I might only be able to spare a little time from my schedule, so even if I can only stay briefly, I’ll go with you if that’s okay.”

 

Given that he didn’t need to accept the invitation, his willingness to go suggested genuine regret and offered goodwill. Indeed, Lisbell hadn’t raised the issue since that day, making this a decision he’d come to on his own.

 

Her thoughts clashed intensely.

 

If she had time to attend such an event, visiting her mother at the hospital would be the right thing. However, she was also curious about Theodore’s situation. Without Bianca, Lisbell would never have known anything about him.

 

Her mind began to ache again.

 

She didn’t understand.

 

Hadn’t she resolved the conflict between her mother and Theodore in Marnia? Why did it still persist? Why did she still feel like a lost child, suffering from the relationship between the two?

 

She thought she had definitively cut ties with Theodore, but was that not the case?

 

Lisbell looked down at the invitation in her hand. Her vision blurred, making the letters look distorted. Her mind felt heavy. She rubbed her eyes, feeling the itch she had temporarily forgotten rising again.

 

“…Can you come with me?”

 

She still had lingering regrets.

 

If she could just confirm that Theodore was living well, it would settle her uneasy mind. She was clinging to the more promising option for confirmation.

 

Last time, she chose her mother; this time, she chose Theodore.

 

Even a marionette with strings hanging loosely from its back wouldn’t look as pitiful.

 

***

 

“Are you serious?”

 

Ulrich, tilting his coffee cup, glanced towards the window. When he brought Lisbell to the capital, it was just turning into a chilly autumn. The wind had quickly become cold enough to rival winter.

 

Speaking of winter, he thought of the fireplace in his bedroom that warmed his nights during that season. Specifically, the mantelpiece above it, where small letters were placed nearly every day.

 

The handwriting saying ‘To Mother’ was as round and neat as her personality. When in a particularly good mood, he found the letters so adorable he wanted to kiss them.

 

“Ulrich, tell me. You’re not serious, right?”

 

“You need to speak clearly, Mother. If you’re vague, how am I to know what you’re referring to?”

 

“There’s no way you’re serious.”

 

“Is this a demonstration of improved acting skills? If so, you should seat a partner more suited to you than me.”

 

Finally, Lady Altahart surrendered.

 

“I am referring to the winter tea party hosted by Lady Cliquemont. You said you’d attend.”

 

“Oh, that.”

 

Ulrich nodded as if just realizing it, then tilted his head in another direction, puzzled.

 

“It was conveyed through Victor, but how did you know, Mother? Are you spying on me?”

 

“You know perfectly well, so what’s the point of asking?”

 

“It was a verification process. Anyway, you admit you’re spying.”

 

“Don’t blame Victor. He was just following my orders.”

 



 

“And without such surveillance, I wouldn’t have had the chance to curb your recklessness, so I don’t regret it.”

 

Although she said this, it was clear Lady Altahart wasn’t pleased. Surveillance or not, her son’s sudden revelation of attending a single noblewoman’s tea party wouldn’t undo the fact.

 

“Ulrich, what’s gotten into you lately?”

 

“Still speaking vaguely. Please be clearer.”

 

“You’re hopeless.”

 



 

“Is it because I set up a meeting with Daphne at the hotel without warning? Or are you still upset about my scolding for skipping the Schwaben Museum exhibition?”

 

“I’d like to ask you, Mother.”

 

Ulrich, having taken a sip of his coffee, finally directed his gaze towards her. Their eyes, of the same color and intensity, met in the air. His eyes carried a slightly sharper glint.

Chapter 86


“The one who taught me not to indiscriminately accept invitations for the sake of our family’s dignity was none other than my mother.”

 



 

“The reason I acted according to that teaching was because the head of the Schwaben family, who should know our family’s principles, dared to send me an invitation. I didn’t attend without discernment, and instead, I did what I wanted to do.”

 



 

“But Mother wasn’t pleased with that. The day after I went to the theater, she called me here and held me for an hour asking why I didn’t respond to the invitation meant for me.”

 

Ulrich tilted his head slightly, his soft platinum hair swaying.

 

“So this time, I accepted the invitation indiscriminately.”

 



 

“I’m merely acting according to Mother’s principles, so I really want to ask what exactly is so displeasing about it.”

 

Listening to her son’s lengthy defense, the lady felt the urge to hold her forehead. It was truly a case of being caught in one’s own trap.

 

To collect herself, the lady sipped the tea in front of her. Meanwhile, Ulrich looked out the window and hummed a small tune.

 

The lady often felt that this son was an unpredictable creature. Despite being siblings, he was so different from Gwen, who was born from the same womb. Although Gwen wasn’t particularly easy to raise, he wasn’t as difficult as Ulrich.

 

The eldest, who had passed away, was straightforward, making it easy to steer him in the desired direction. But Ulrich often had thoughts that were hard to understand.

 

The past few days had been similarly trying. Today, the lady finally grasped her son’s true intentions.

 

He wasn’t simply holding a grudge.

 

Perhaps he had meticulously planned and drawn a blueprint from a very shallow starting point to reach this moment.

 

The more she thought about what she was about to say, the more convinced she became.

 

“…Is the engagement with Daphne really that undesirable?”

 

“I never intended to come to the capital so early.”

 

“What could we do? Gwen ended up like that.”

 

“Indeed. He was of no help when he was alive.”

 

“Ulrich.”

 

She pretended to sternly warn him not to belittle his deceased brother, but Ulrich just shrugged and calmly sipped his coffee.

 

Knowing better than anyone the outrageous acts her second son committed whenever he was displeased, the lady couldn’t say more. Now was not the time to engage in a petty argument over minor remarks.

 

“Fine, I understand. I’ll inform the Cliquemont family that you won’t be attending.”

 

“What inform?”

 

“That you won’t be able to attend the tea party… Ulrich, do you really intend to go? Is it not enough that you accepted the invitation of a family you have no ties to, but now as a man, you’re going to attend a tea party in the middle of a busy time?”

 

“Anyone would think a tea party is highly inappropriate.”

 

Ulrich showed no sign of backing down.

 

The lady knew well what he was trying to elicit with this stance.

 

Finally, she sighed.

 

“Alright… Do as you wish. Just make sure to inform them quickly. Thinking about the rumors that will spread about you attending a tea party with a single lady after the theater incident shortens my lifespan.”

 

“Break off my engagement.”

 

Finally, a clear proposal came from him.

 

“…Ulrich.”

 

“I don’t intend to live as Mother’s puppet.”

 

At his firm resolve, the Altahart lady closed her eyes gently and then opened them.

 

“It sounds like a threat.”

 

“It couldn’t be.”

 



 

“I’m giving you options. Will you just watch as your son’s honor is tarnished, or will you understand and respect your one remaining son?”

 

Ulrich’s leisurely gaze met his mother’s. He smiled beautifully.

 

“If it’s the mother I know, the latter is the more suitable choice.”

 

Anyone else would have stubbornly insisted on their own way. But the Altahart lady was also a parent. No parent could win against their child. Pushing Ulrich further was futile.

 

Moreover, it was a pointless fight.

 

The more she pushed Ulrich, the more he would erode his dignity, and in turn, tarnish her name as well. They were connected by the bloodline of ‘Altahart.’

 

The Altahart lady set down the empty teacup she had used to calm herself and sighed lightly.

 

“I can’t just stand by and watch my beloved son’s honor be ruined.”

 

Ulrich smiled serenely. It was the smile of a victor.

 

“I’ll inform the Cliquemont family as soon as possible.”

 

“I’d appreciate that. Also, the young lady of the Cliquemont family has many rumors, so I’d prefer if you didn’t get involved further.”

 

“You mean the rumor that she’s an incorrigible troublemaker?”

 

“That’s a very simplified version of the true story, which is even scarier.”

 

“Aha.”

 



 

“Well, I wasn’t particularly interested in her anyway.”

 

Thinking the matter was settled, Ulrich rose from his seat.

 

Just as he was about to leave, he stopped suddenly.

 

“Ah, wait a moment.”

 

“Hmm?”

 

“Although I won’t attend the tea party, I have to meet the young lady of Cliquemont separately.”

 

“What do you mean?”

 

“I have a promise to keep.”

 

The lady’s expression turned curious.

 

Recalling Lisbell from the previous night, Ulrich realized they seemed quite close. The invitation, sent so proudly after he thought they wouldn’t meet again, was not a one-sided acquaintance.

 

Therefore, Ulrich decided to respond willingly. He felt the need to appease Lisbell a little.

 

“Do you have something to hide from me?”

 

He wasn’t sure when, but the time wasn’t yet.

 

He needed to drag this out a bit longer.

 

The recent days spent with her, the occasional tension, the situations he maneuvered to his advantage using her—all of it was enjoyable.

 

Enjoyable.

 

A very unfamiliar term for his monotonous life. It had been a long time since he felt such vibrant stimulation. Amidst the busy chaos, the thing that kept him sane was his time with Lisbell.

 

Hoping to maintain this, he knew how to offer the right incentives. Even if the secret would eventually come out, there was a right time for everything.

 

He didn’t want her leaving the mansion any more than necessary. The more she saw of the world, the more she would think. He needed to thoroughly suppress her thoughts.

 

“…Could it be.”

 

The lady’s face hardened slightly as she opened her mouth after a brief silence.

 

“Is it because of that woman?”

 

“Since you’re so worried about others seeing me with the young lady of Cliquemont, I’ll consider inviting her quietly to the mansion. It’s just a one-time meeting, so you’ll allow that, right?”

 

“She looked at you with fearful eyes.”

 



 

“It was barely enough to even call her a mistress.”

 

The lady’s serious gaze was one of reminiscing the past. It wasn’t hard to pinpoint the time. It must have been when they accidentally met in the dining room.

 

“Even though you’re my son, sometimes I can’t understand you.”

 



 

“Ulrich, many things change depending on how people think. Relationships are like that too. Did I ever tell you to kick that woman out of the mansion immediately? Did I ever hint that to you? No, I only advised you to be cautious so rumors wouldn’t spread.”

 



 

“I won’t mind if you have multiple mistresses. Just ensure the right person is in the proper place. Choose a respectable woman to be your wife, hold a ceremonious wedding, and once everything is settled, you can have as many mistresses as you like.”

 



 

“A man’s curiosity is just a seasonal whim. You might cherish her now, but there will come a time when that curiosity fades. When that happens, you’ll regret the actions taken under the influence of fleeting desires. It will all seem like the foolishness of a trivial mind. This is advice purely for your sake, so I hope you don’t take it badly.”

 

Her mother’s doctrine was long and pointless.

 

He understood it in his head but found it utterly unconvincing.

 

He couldn’t understand why things had to be that way.


As my mother said, it might be a momentary desire.

 

No matter how intense it becomes, it will eventually fade away, like the temperature of that season.

 

But is it wrong to be fully immersed in that desire?

 

If the interest will fade anyway, is it wrong to savor it to the fullest beforehand?

 

If even that is impossible, then why do the burdens and values of AltaHart exist that constantly weigh on my shoulders?

 

It raises many questions, but there are no sharp answers. Ulrich thought that his mother’s theory wasn’t absolute either. Such instability couldn’t be used as a benchmark.

 

He smiled softly, as if to hide his stiffened inner self.

 

“It doesn’t matter if you don’t understand.”

 

Ulrich walked towards the door with firm steps. Only when he reached the door did he turn to look at his mother.

 

“Just as you have your own romance, I must have my own.”

 

***

 

As soon as the door opened, the sound of someone standing up abruptly was heard. In this mansion, which was chilly all day long as if only corpses lived here, it was rare to encounter such bustling signs of life. But because of that, it exuded a strong human scent.

 

“Lisbell!”

 

Bianca, who stood up, pounding the table, was highly excited. It was a face that hinted at what thoughts she had while staying here after receiving an invitation. Anxiety and nervousness, corresponding expectations and thrills. Well, such complex things.

 

“Bianca.”

 

Even if we were to reunite, I never thought it would be here. Contrary to Lisbell’s thoughts, Bianca was now at the AltaHart mansion. As a guest invited by Ulrich.

 

“What, what is all this? I still can’t believe it. That I’m in the AltaHart mansion…. I can’t believe it even after saying it out loud. Could you pinch my cheek for a second?”

 

Bianca couldn’t wait and pinched her own cheek. Ouch, a weak groan escaped through her twisted lips. Bianca’s expression became even more blank.

 

Lisbell sat her down to calm her. The table was already splendidly set for guest hospitality. Lisbell smiled inwardly as she saw that a few cookies were missing.

 

“Bianca, calm down.”

 

“Calm down? If you knew what kind of smile my mother gave me today, you wouldn’t say that. And her tone! She gently interrogated me about how I came to know someone from this household, making my whole body shiver…. And she patted my shoulder three times while seeing me off. Three times. Not two, but three times. Lisbell, this is truly astonishing!”

 

As Bianca’s fuss grew longer, Lisbell’s mouth dried up.

 

She hesitated, then took a sip of the coffee she had poured into her empty cup.

 

“Your mother probably thought this was an opportunity to build a connection with AltaHart, but in reality, you’re meeting with me instead.”

 

“What? What does that matter! I’m so happy to see you again, even like this. I was so disappointed that you couldn’t come to my tea party. But then I found the letter inviting me to this mansion right after that.”

 

Bianca stuck out her tongue as if she was still stunned by the thought. Lisbell brought a small plate with cookies to her. Bianca eagerly ate another cookie, finding it to her taste.

 

“Rather, say something. I’m so curious I’m about to stand my hair on end. Since when have you been so close with the nobleman?”

 

The nobleman. She must be referring to Ulrich AltaHart. Lisbell felt the distant sense and responded awkwardly.

 

“We’re not close.”

 

“Not close? You live in the same mansion, he received your invitation as if it were his own and returned it to you, and in this intimate situation, how can you say that? I naturally thought you were in a romantic relationship with the nobleman!”

 

If I had been holding a teacup, I would have dropped it.

 

A romantic relationship.

 

Does it seem to others that the man and I are in such a tender relationship?

 

My stomach tightened.

 

There was a gap between speculation and reality. In reality, Lisbell was merely a scarecrow, bound tightly in the prison the man had made, deprived of her freedom with her mother held hostage.

 

“Wrong.”

 

“What?”

 

“Don’t say such things.”

 

Bianca, rarely looking puzzled, was taken aback.

 

Realizing that she had been too sharp, Lisbell quickly tried to make amends.

 

“I owe Mr. AltaHart a debt, so I’m staying with him for a while. That’s all, we are nothing more.”

 

“Then what about the time we ran into each other at the theater? The play we watched, it’s very popular among couples in Laurent these days. You two clearly came together that day.”

 

“He was exhausted from overwork recently, so he took me along to relax and watch the play. Like you said, it’s unbecoming for a man to go alone to such a famous place.”

 

“Then why did he invite me to the mansion today?”

 

“Since I couldn’t attend your tea party as a commoner, he invited you here instead. It’s purely out of his kindness.”

 

“Hmm… really?”

 

Bianca’s enthusiasm waned. Although her doubts hadn’t completely disappeared, she thought it would be impolite to pry further when Lisbell had been so clear-cut. Soon, she skillfully changed the topic.

 

“Have you been well? When did you come to the capital? You should have contacted me if you came!”

 

Realizing that the avoided topic had finally subsided, Lisbell relaxed and engaged in the conversation.

 

Just like when they met at the theater, Bianca was the same.

 

Still honest, and that aspect was charming.

 

She burst into laughter at a certain story, then looked around as if someone was watching her. After a while, she seemed to realize this wasn’t her mansion but a place she was invited to, so she laughed openly without worrying.

 

It felt odd to sense a commonness from a noble, but that was the Bianca Lisbell had known.

 

“Then, once you’ve settled your debt, are you going back to the countryside? Was it Misley?”

 

Bianca asked as her laughter subsided.

 

For a brief moment, her thoughts halted.

 

When did it start? Whenever she faced something complex, her mind would send red signals, turning her thoughts white. In an instant, she became a fool who couldn’t think. This must be the ‘don’t think’ Ulrich often referred to.

 

Lisbell rubbed her eyes to wake her frozen brain.

 

Afterwards.

 

What happens afterwards….

 

Come to think of it, I had never thought about the future.

 

Why hadn’t I considered that moment?

 

Why did I think I would be tied to him for life?

 

When his interest in me fades, I will be free.

 

The freedom I have longed for so much….

 

“Lisbell?”

 

“Huh?”

 

“Why did you suddenly go quiet? You’re speaking less.”

 

“Oh, it’s nothing.”

 

I have to take care of my sick mother.

 

And I have to do what I want to do.

 

The blueprint I had belatedly conceived felt thin, as if something important was missing.

 

Is it because I haven’t decided where to live?

 

Because I haven’t made any future financial plans?

 

Or maybe.

 

…Ah.

 

The absence of Theodore, who was naturally part of that blueprint, left a void. The emptiness made everything feel clumsy and inadequate.

 

“Bianca.”

 

“Yes?”

 

“Remember the thing you were about to tell me last time?”

 

“What thing?”

 

“The news about Theo.”

 



 

“What were you trying to tell me then?”

 

This impromptu meeting had its purposes. Ulrich felt guilty for not accompanying her to visit, Bianca wanted to reunite with an old friend, and Lisbell… wanted to hear the news about Theodore she hadn’t heard.

 

“Ah, right,” Bianca said, her attention piqued. She dusted off the cookie crumbs from her hands and leaned closer.

 

“Recently, Mr. Mortier came to Laurent regarding a delivery issue and visited our mansion as a courtesy. I mean, Theodore’s father.”

 



 

“Apparently, Theodore returned to his hometown, Renbruck.”

 

“To Renbruck?”

 

“Yes. I wasn’t there long, so I’m not certain, but it seems he’s preparing to take over as the factory owner, following in his father’s footsteps.”




 

“Yeah. Thinking about it, that was strange. You two said your dream was to run a small elementary school in the countryside after getting married. But then Theodore suddenly decided to take over the factory owner’s position, which he claimed he had no interest in, and you, Lisbell, appeared in Laurent out of the blue.”

 



 

“You two really did break up, didn’t you?”

 

Bianca’s tone was bitter. But it was nothing compared to Lisbell’s heart. The words that firmly confirmed their separation felt like they were digging into the core of her being. The unresolved pain weighed heavily on her heart, causing the once smooth surface of her emotions to collapse.

 

“Relationships are terrifying when you think about it. They’re the deepest connections, but they’re also the most transient.”

 



 

“I just… I wish you and Theo happiness in your own ways.”

 

“…Yeah, thank you.”

 

Factory owner.

 

He who loved children the most had discussed with her and was the first to give up that path and future. For him to take it up again… meant that Theodore had also given up on their future together. Just as he no longer appeared in her blueprint, she no longer appeared in his.

 

Is it like this for everyone?

 

Do people slowly become strangers like this?

 

Lisbell half-listened to Bianca’s words as she gazed at the sky, where blue clouds were drifting by.

 

The wind blowing through the closed window was unusual.

 

Winter was coming.

 

No, summer had already ended long ago.

 

***

 

Bianca left after staying for about an hour longer.

 

Lisbell wanted to see her off outside the mansion, but the old butler stopped her. Knowing what it meant, Lisbell had no choice but to say goodbye to Bianca with a hug inside the building before returning to her bedroom. Just inviting Bianca over had been more kindness than she deserved.

 

Walking down the unusually long corridor, Lisbell kept mulling over the news Bianca had brought about Theodore.

 

He had returned to their hometown of Renbruck, was preparing to take over the factory owner’s position….

 

That’s good.

 

Despite her sadness, such thoughts came to her. It seemed like he had properly taken care of their ruined wedding and future, and was now planning and establishing something new. Perhaps that path suited Theo better. Given his inherently diligent and cautious nature, he would do well as a factory owner.

 

…Theo is doing that.

 

And the more she felt relieved, the more despair about her own situation overwhelmed her.

 

Even the ex-fiancé who received such a notification was living well, so what was she doing here?

 

When she went to meet Bianca, she had conflicted thoughts about whether this was right, whether holding onto regrets about Theodore was even acceptable, but upon meeting her, her thoughts changed completely.

 

Instead, she resolved.

 

She couldn’t keep being dragged around by Ulrich like this.

 

Having wrapped up the lingering issue with Theodore, it was time to face her mother’s matters. She could no longer just watch Ulrich’s reactions and be cautious. Her patience was wearing thin.

 

Pondering the most appropriate approach, she opened the door to her bedroom. Without her, Ulrich’s bedroom was always quiet and cold like a wooden doll. As Lisbell turned inward, she caught sight of herself in the mirror. Suddenly, she stopped.

 

Seeing this, she understood why Bianca thought of her as Ulrich’s lover. Even today, she was wearing a high-quality dress Ulrich had personally chosen for her. She had planned to wear anything, but he had somehow read her thoughts in advance and left the dress hung neatly in the closet.

 

Suppressing the revulsion, she had worn it to meet Bianca. Now that she had achieved her goal, she wanted to take it off immediately. As she raised her arms to unbutton the neckline at the back,

 

Thud-

 

A strange sound spread in the otherwise empty space. Lisbell stopped adjusting her dress and quickly turned around. The sound came from her makeshift wardrobe, arranged to Ulrich’s taste.

 

“…Is anyone there?”

 

It was a ridiculous question.

 

If there was no one, there would be no answer.

 

Just as she expected, there was no response. She tried to ignore it, but in the unnerving atmosphere of the bedroom, it was hard to dismiss. Lisbell cautiously approached the wardrobe. Confirming her suspicion, she heard a faint rustle from inside.

 

Without hesitation, Lisbell opened the wardrobe.

 

Her eyes widened immediately.

 

“…Noah?”

 

Noah, whom she thought was in his bedroom, was inside her wardrobe. His eyes were tearful, likely scared of the dark. Startled, Lisbell bent down. The child extended his short arms as if asking to be held. Lisbell quickly picked him up.

 

“Noah, why are you here…? No, how did you get here…?”

 

“Came to see Liz…”

 

Noah mumbled, pressing his chubby cheek against her chest. Lisbell quickly guessed the reason for his actions.

 

“You missed me?”

 

“Yes…”

 

“So you came all the way here?”

 

Noah’s small head nodded up and down. Lisbell, stroking the back of his head, noticed the wide bed behind them. The memory of last night with Ulrich flashed through her mind. Suddenly, the space felt suffocating. She didn’t want to keep Noah in Ulrich’s room, a place that tainted her spirit.

 

Lisbell hurried towards the door.

 

“Noah, even if you miss me, you can’t just come here.”

 

“Why? Why…?”

 

“Because this isn’t my bedroom. You know it belongs to someone else.”

 

“Yeah.”

 

She gently stroked Noah’s side hair. Opening the door, she finally felt relieved. Lisbell thought it might cause trouble if someone saw them, so she tried to put Noah down, but he clung tightly, not wanting to let go.

 

“Actually…”

 

“Yes?”

 

While practically running towards Noah’s room, he spoke shyly.

 

“Did you… write today too?”

 

“Write what?”

 

“A letter… to mother.”

 

“Not yet today. Why do you ask?”

 

“Just because…”

 

Noah fidgeted with his hands. Maybe he was thinking about the pendant. Lisbell didn’t give it much thought and quickened her pace. Shortly, they reached Noah’s bedroom. Despite Noah’s reluctance to part today, she managed to calm him down and put him to sleep. After tucking him in, Lisbell gently stroked his cheek and stood up.

 

Something brushed against her foot.

 

It was the box Noah had hurriedly hidden the other day. The lid had slightly opened from being kicked. After a moment’s hesitation, Lisbell quietly closed the lid and pushed the box back under the bed.

 

If he wanted to keep it hidden, he should have stored it properly.

 

She chuckled inwardly and carefully tucked the blanket around Noah before leaving the room.

 

“Did you come to watch my performance last time?”

 

She was halfway up the stairs.

 

Julian Scott was standing at a corner where he could look outside through the window. The sharp, cold wind blew in through the window he had opened, dissipating the smell of his cigarette.

 

She should have passed by without looking, but his words stopped her. They brought back unpleasant memories. The day she had gone to the theater due to Ulrich’s coercion, meeting Julian Scott on stage while she was entangled with Ulrich.

 

Julian let out a smirk at Lisbell’s lack of response.

 

“You said you weren’t a mistress.”

 

Julian finally said what she had feared. She wanted to believe it wasn’t true, but reality was always harsh. His words could only mean one thing. He had clearly seen her and Ulrich’s actions from the dark, beyond the balcony.

 

Was today a lucky day or an unlucky one?

 

It was a day when she could fully hear about Theodore and close that chapter, but also a day when she was twice mistaken for Ulrich’s mistress or lover.

 

Lisbell took a deep breath to calm herself.

 

“I told you last time.”

 

“What? That you’re being blackmailed because of a weakness?”

 



 

“You didn’t look like it.”

 

“Are you trying to insult me?”

 

“Of course not.”

 

Julian crossed his arms and leaned against the windowsill.

 

“I can help you.”

 

His dubious offer approached her like a dark hand.

“Didn’t we have this conversation once before?”

 

“Yes, and I also told Lisbell, who was wary of me like now, that there was no need for that.”

 



 

“Why do you keep trying to distance yourself? Lisbell, I just want to get closer to you.”

 

“Is there any reason to do that when we won’t see each other soon anyway?”

 

Hmm, he hummed deeply.

 

“It seems like the lady wants to kick you out of here.”

 

“…What?”

 

“I told you not to make an enemy out of the lady.”

 



 

“It seems she got really pricked by this incident. She ordered her secretary to investigate you.”

 



 

“I heard your mother is hospitalized at the Laurent Royal Hospital. Is that the weakness that the second young master found?”

 

Kick out. Don’t make an enemy. Pricked. My head ached from trying to unravel these nonsensical words.

 

Lisbell was soon startled.

 

No need to ask if it was true, if the lady had ordered an investigation on her. Knowing about her mother, which even Julian hadn’t mentioned, made it undoubtedly true.

 

“Did the lady tell you?”

 

“Not exactly. The secretary came to report while the lady and I were enjoying ourselves in the bedroom.”

 



 

“So, it was by coincidence.”

 

“Ha….”

 

“Was this really blackmail material?”

 

Seeing no reason to hide anything further, Lisbell slowly nodded, judging that this man could exert less influence on her than Ulrich. Julian let out a disbelieving laugh.

 

“The mighty Ulrich catching a woman’s weakness and playing with it.”

 

“…So, why did the lady investigate me?”

 

“Ah, she thinks you’re making the second young master act strange.”

 



 

“So, I intend to help you to earn some favor with the lady.”

 

“What do you mean by that?”

 

“If the reason you’re here is because of your mother’s weakness, then solving that problem means you no longer need to be here with the second young master. Isn’t that right?”

 

“That’s….”

 

It was true.

 

The only reason Lisbell was entangled with Ulrich was that her sick mother was held as a hostage.

 

“If I help solve that problem, your weakness will disappear, and you won’t need to stay in this mansion anymore. That seems like the best outcome the lady wants right now.”

 

“…Just for that reason?”

 

“Haha. You still don’t understand the people in this household, do you?”

 



 

“Unlike you, who claims to be held here against your will, I stay in this mansion by my own choice. I even came in here as a lover, hoping for the leftovers.”

 



 

“The lady’s favor is that very leftovers for me.”

 

He kindly explained as if worried she wouldn’t understand. Thanks to that, she understood very clearly. So, he wasn’t helping her to get on her good side but to get on Lady Altahart’s good side.

 

Trying to accept that Ulrich’s mother saw her as a thorn in her side, along with his offer, made her head spin. Lisbell wiped her face as she stood there.

 

Then, all thoughts vanished in an instant.

 

A bubble, two, three, emerged.

 

The news of Theodore from Bianca.

 

Julian’s purpose now clear.

 

And Ulrich’s attitude of hiding something.

 

“…The hospital….”

 

When the three bubbles overlapped, her lips parted as if swept by a wave.

 

“Ulrich admitted my mother to this hospital without my permission.”

 

“Wow, didn’t expect him to use such rough methods.”

 

“But since coming to the capital, I haven’t seen my mother even once.”

 

“Not once?”

 

“Ulrich said visits were only possible if he was present.”

 



 

“But he’s been too busy lately to take me to the hospital.”

 

Julian smirked.

 

Next, his question formed the suspicion that had been brewing in her heart.

 

“Could he really not spare any time to visit the hospital?”

 



 

“Our second young master, despite his looks, has a rather shady side.”

 

“…You’re right. It seems like Ulrich could make time but isn’t doing it, or it’s an excuse.”

 

“An excuse. That means….”

 

“Yes…. I think my mother might not even be in that hospital.”

 

“Then where is she?”

 

“I don’t know. I’m not sure, but… Ulrich is definitely hiding something from me. The most plausible scenario is that he didn’t admit her to the hospital and is hiding that fact.”

 

If not….

 

There was another possibility, but Lisbell shook her head to dismiss the thought. It couldn’t be.

 

“So, you want me to find out if your mother is really admitted there?”

 

“…Is that possible?”

 

She recalled the hospital she visited the previous day. Her mother’s room was located beyond the general access area, heavily guarded. She didn’t even have the courage to try getting in herself.

 

Julian put the short cigarette back in his mouth. Seeming deep in thought, he soon locked eyes with her.

 

“It is possible.”

 

“Really?”

 

“It’s probably true that you can’t visit without the second young master.”

 



 

“The special ward at the Royal Hospital, where your mother is supposed to be admitted, is a building established under the royal family’s influence, backed by influential noble lords who invest large sums every quarter in exchange for top-notch medical treatment unlike any other. Being such a discreet organization, it’s strictly off-limits to outsiders. Only those approved by connections, like needing to be accompanied by the second young master, can enter.”

 

She hadn’t known such details.

 

She had always wondered why the procedures were so stringent, why visits were restricted by the presence of another. Without Julian, she might have remained ignorant forever, making her neck tingle with fear.

 

But as she got closer to the truth, the situation felt even more daunting.

 

“Can you really look into such a place?”

 

Hearing about its standing and authority felt like it was in the clouds. It was something unimaginable to Lisbell before her entanglement with Ulrich.

 

Seeing what she found daunting, Julian exhaled smoke. The swirling cigarette smoke felt unsettling as it hung in the air.

 

“I once heard that the family of a lady I served had connections there. I can try to use that network to look into it.”

 

Perhaps it was his status in this mansion or the unsettling gaze he gave her that made Lisbell recall Ulrich calling him a “gigolo.” Even trying to interpret it positively seemed impossible.

 

The lady he once served.

 

He had been a gigolo for noblewomen from the start.

 

“Don’t look at me like that. I did it to survive. Did you think I joined the theater troupe purely by luck? Unfortunately, the world doesn’t work so easily.”

 



 

“I don’t take pride in crawling between old women’s legs. Especially considering my preferences. I prefer young and beautiful women if I can.”

 

His gaze subtly swept over her, unmistakably sticky. His eyes couldn’t be blamed on smoke now. Julian’s gaze was undeniably lewd.

 

His eyes crawled over her like saliva, making her feel like a bug was crawling on her skin. In short, it was unpleasant. Lisbell instinctively stepped back.


Mocking the sudden rise of her wariness, he curled his lips into a smirk. The sight of his upturned smile felt prickly, as if it would taint her consciousness. Ignoring his eerie grin, Lisbell brought the diverted conversation back on track.

 

“…If you can do something for me, I’ll show you some sincerity.”

 

“How so?”

 

“I could steal something of Ulrich’s and give it to you…”

 

Julian’s eyes widened before scrunching up in a distasteful grimace, a sign he was holding back laughter.

 

“Planning to filch some jewelry?”

 

“His bedroom’s full of it. He probably wouldn’t notice if one went missing.”

 

When she responded indifferently, he clutched his stomach and burst into loud laughter. She couldn’t understand what was so funny. The tension that wouldn’t fade made Lisbell moisten her dry lips. Julian, who had barely managed to lift his head, turned his sharp gaze to her.

 

“You still don’t realize how scary the people in this house are, do you, Lisbell? Even if you had the guts to steal something, don’t give it to me. I don’t want to get caught up in anything, so I’ll pass.”

 



 

“How about something else? There’s something simpler.”

 

“What…?”

 

Julian unconsciously leaned closer. The distance was already short enough that their lips almost touched. Lisbell’s face froze with shock. The man who nearly committed a botched kiss only smiled smugly.

 

“A kiss?”

 



 

“A show of sincerity like that would be enough.”

 

Julian winked at her, as if to ask what she was going to do. Lisbell stared at him blankly before letting out a dry chuckle. After Ulrich, now this man was treating her like a prostitute. It was humiliating and made her feel sick, but she had to endure it. If she thought about it, it was all Ulrich’s fault she was being treated this way. Only with Julian Scott’s help could she find a way to escape from Ulrich’s side.

 

At this moment, there was no other option. Wasn’t she already searching for a better method?

 

Julian’s plan was solid enough, and it would be foolish to reject it just because she felt uneasy about a brief kiss. It wasn’t like she could break through the hospital’s tightly guarded ward all by herself.

 

There was nothing else to consider.

 

Think only of your mother.

 

The only person left by her side, her mother….

 

Resolving herself with painful determination, Lisbell nodded. Julian, seeming satisfied with the agreement, deepened his smile and straightened his previously relaxed posture.

 

“A wise choice.”

 



 

“If I learn anything, we can talk again. For now, I’ll be going.”

 

Leaving behind a rather theatrical nod, he descended the stairs first and disappeared. Once his retreating figure finally vanished, Lisbell turned and walked in the opposite direction, rubbing her mouth with the back of her hand.

 

She marveled at how simple it all seemed.

 

Offering her body to Ulrich to pay for hospital bills had become so routine that giving up a kiss wasn’t even something to think twice about. She hadn’t even kissed Julian yet, but she already felt unbearably uneasy.

 

Lisbell scrubbed the spot with the back of her hand. As she kept repeating the motion, her delicate lips became swollen from being rubbed raw. Eventually, she couldn’t withstand the rough force, and they slightly split.

 

Lisbell, standing with her hand awkwardly raised, turned her head slightly. Her faint reflection appeared in the hallway window. Amid the blurred, muted colors, only the drop of blood on her lips stood out clearly in her vision.

 

It made her feel oddly creeped out, so she hurriedly averted her gaze. The only sound in the hallway leading to her bedroom was the echo of her own crossing footsteps. The corridor of the mansion felt particularly desolate today.

 

***

 

Looking back, that day was strangely off.

 

If asked what was off, it would be hard to pinpoint exactly, but everything, from beginning to end, was odd.

 

It started with the dream she had just before waking up.

 

Even the dream she had that night was unsettling and ominous.

 

When Lisbell opened her eyes in what she thought was reality, she found herself standing in an endless field. The sensation at her feet was similar to weeds brushing against her, but it wasn’t the familiar green.

 

It was all pitch black.

 

It was like a web of inky black dye had been splattered everywhere, or like someone’s long hair had been scattered all around. The sight was so chilling that she couldn’t stand still and kept walking.

 

Rustle Rustle

 

The feel of the ground against her bare feet was indescribably strange. The entirely black surface was soft and yielding, making her feel as if she were walking on someone’s scalp. Was it really hair wrapping around her feet? Was she stepping on someone’s skin?

 

The further she went, the more bewildered she became. Lisbell began to feel scared. Even if she were to be trapped in a labyrinth for the rest of her life, it wouldn’t be as terrifying as this.

 

“Haah, haah…”

 

When she came to her senses, she was running, unable to catch her breath. A cold wind blew from somewhere. Maybe it was what caused the black foliage to sway in unison.

 

Whooo, whooo—

 

The sound of the surrounding foliage was like the wailing of a mournful soul.

 

She couldn’t comprehend it. Everything was beyond understanding. Without even glancing back, Lisbell continued to run forward, her eyes fixed straight ahead. The more she ran, the more the feeling of the foliage wrapping around her legs intensified. By the time it started climbing up to her calves, the constriction became unbearable.

 

“Haah haa… ugh!”

 

It felt like her knee was being bitten. Without even a chance to resist, Lisbell fell forward. The ground, which had seemed soft enough to trip over just moments ago, was now unbearably hard as it slammed into her body. This couldn’t possibly be someone’s skin.

 

As she tried to assess her aching body, she barely managed to sit up.

 

Caw!

 

Caw!

 

The eerie sound of the foliage was replaced by the sinister cawing of crows.

 

The noise scraped at her brain. Lisbell clutched her ears and winced. While she was struggling with the pain in her eardrums, something caught her eye. Just a few steps ahead of where she had fallen was a crow, as big as her own body.

 

Caw!

 

The crow spread its wings wide and flapped them vigorously, tilting its head back. Its sharp beak was stained with blood. The sight, as if she were witnessing a gruesome murder, sent a shiver down her spine.

 

Don’t go near it.

 

Turn back and get away from that horrifying thing.

 

She knew she should do that, but despite her thoughts, Lisbell found herself stumbling toward the giant crow. She had spotted something resembling a dried-up hand near the crow’s body.

 

It was a form she was all too familiar with.

 

Steeling herself against the gut-wrenching tension, she took a step forward. Finally, she was close enough to see what lay before the crow. The sight made Lisbell’s head spin.

 

It was her mother.

 

Her mother, lying there as she had been the last time Lisbell had seen her in the pouring rain in Marnia.

 

But it wasn’t exactly the same.

 

The murderous crow dipped its pitch-black head down and began pecking at her mother’s insides, its beak drenched in blood.

 

Lisbell tried to scream.

 

But no sound came out. Instead, the pressure from holding back the scream clawed at her throat, choking her like hands wrapped around her neck. Gasping and wheezing, she crumbled to the ground.

 

As she frantically grasped at her throat, something began to take form around her neck. The sensation, which she had earlier thought was similar to the feel of grass, began to change.

 

It felt soft and resilient, like fabric.

 

Almost like neckties….

 

It was as if dozens of neckties had been tied around her neck, dragging her around like a noose. Lisbell, reduced to a state barely distinguishable from a corpse, crawled aimlessly through the darkness.

 

Caw!

 

As the crow’s cries, coming from who knows where, cut through her ears for the third time, Lisbell finally woke from the dream.

 

Shhhhh

 

Her entire body was drenched in cold sweat. Still unable to fully shake off the nightmare, Lisbell turned her head.

 

Heavy rain was pouring outside the window.

 

It was the winter rain, heralding the change of seasons.
