Time passed quickly.

 

Day by day.

 

Each morning, her mood changed. Some days she was excited, some days overwhelmed. Some days she felt suffocated as if the future was invisible, and other days she was calm, believing things would work out somehow.

 

The one thing that lightened her heavy heart was the recent news from her mother.

 

Her mother had officially submitted her resignation and would stay on as a caretaker only until the end of the month.

 

Despite returning safely to Misley, many things were still bothering her. Among them was her mother’s safety, who was still working under Ulrich Altahart. She had always been uneasy about it. There was even a bit of resentment wondering why her mother hadn’t listened to her pleas to leave.

 

So, hearing the news about her resignation was a small relief amidst the misfortune. Lisbell reminded herself that there were only a few days left until she would no longer need to call that villa.

 

Everything was slowly getting sorted out.

 

Her mother would soon be free from that devilish man, and she would marry Theodore and leave for another country. The emotional turmoil she felt here would soon be resolved.

 

With the wedding date approaching, the preparations were in their final stages. Today, she and Theodore had chosen plumbago to decorate the venue after much discussion. The blue hue of plumbago, often associated with summer, made her heart flutter thinking about the decorated venue.

 

When they reached the orphanage, Lisbell’s steps stopped involuntarily.

 

“So… Lisbell?”

 

Theodore, who had been talking with gestures, turned his head curiously. But Lisbell couldn’t meet his eyes.

 

A sedan was parked in front of the orphanage. Its presence was unsettling in this rural village, where such a car was uncommon.

 

“Oh, whose car is that…. Is there a visitor?”

 

Theodore mumbled, following Lisbell’s gaze. She couldn’t respond. In fact, she couldn’t react at all.

 

No way….

 

It can’t be.

 

A sharp sense of foreboding hit her chest. A tense feeling crept from her toes. This feeling wasn’t entirely unfamiliar; she had felt it before.

 

When was it?

 

Perhaps it was….

 

“You’re finally here!”

 

A teacher noticed them and waved from a window. Lisbell looked at her with a pale face. The teacher, looking unusually excited, pointed inside.

 

“Lisbell, you have a visitor. Hurry to the reception roomi”

 

“A visitor?”

 

Theodore tilted his head.

 

“Lisbell, were you expecting someone today?”

 



 

“Lisbell?”

 

“Uh? Oh, well, I guess I’ll find out when I go.”

 

Her vision blurred again. As Lisbell entered the orphanage, she clenched and unclenched her fists. Despite the lingering heat of summer, she felt a strange chill.

 

The usually short-seeming corridor seemed unusually long today. When they arrived at the reception room, Theodore opened the door. The slowly widening gap felt like the entrance to a swamp.

 

And her fear was confirmed.

 

“Oh.”

 

The person inside turned toward the door. Platinum hair that remained bright even under the dim lighting.

 

“You’re finally here, Lisbell.”

 

Her anxious heart finally stopped.

 

Ulrich, he was right there.


Chapter 36.


The man had grown up properly.

 

While Lisbell stayed in Marnia, she had never seen him wear a tie properly. Additionally, she found out yet another fact she was not curious about. That black tie was not only a gift from her but also the very thing that had brutally strangled her neck that night.

 

Instinctively, Lisbell touched her neck. The bruises had healed to the point where they were no longer visible. There was no reason for her to feel pain, yet it hurt as if it hadn’t healed at all.

 

Why is this man here?

 

Lisbell thought and thought again. But she couldn’t figure it out. No matter how much she racked her brain, she couldn’t understand why someone she thought she’d never encounter again had appeared in front of her.

 

Of all times.

 

“Who… who are you?”

 

Of all times, when she was with Theodore.

 

Since she couldn’t readily speak, Theodore voiced it instead. Ulrich’s blue-grey eyes, which had been fixated on Lisbell since his appearance, shifted slowly.

 

He smiled a smile beautiful enough to make any man tremble.

 

“Theodore Motier, I presume?”

 

“Yes, that’s correct.”

 

Ulrich approached with the grace of a swan gliding over the water and extended his hand.

 

“Nice to meet you. I’m Ulrich Altahart.”

 

“Alta…”

 

As Theodore reflexively extended his arm for a handshake, his eyes gradually widened.

 

“Al, Altahart?”

 

“Yes.”

 



 

“Are you refusing to shake hands?”

 

Ulrich remained calm in front of the stunned Theodore. The composure he exhibited in Marnia was unchanged here in Misley. Theodore, urged by the noble pressure to hurry up and shake hands, quickly responded.

 

Lisbell gazed distantly at the two men shaking hands.

 

It was a surreal scene. But it didn’t last long. The moment Ulrich’s gaze returned to her, she was dragged back to this dizzying reality.

 

“Lisbell.”

 

Ulrich called her name as if he were very glad to see her. Even the playful laugh at the end, where he rolled his tongue, remained the same.

 

He was, as expected, himself. Unlike her, who was anxious, his calm demeanor was chilling. Lisbell, frozen, quickly noticed Theodore’s eyes turning towards her and hurriedly snapped out of it.

 

“What brings you here…?”

 

“Sorry for showing up unannounced. I have something urgent to tell Lisbell.”

 

He smirked. It was as if he was mocking her cautiousness. Seeing that, the guilt that had corroded black in her chest came alive, unmistakably vivid.

 

Whether this rhythm would quicken or slow was entirely up to Ulrich’s deceitful lips.

 

So, it was appropriate to send Theodore away quickly.

 

There was a risk that Ulrich might drop a bombshell in his presence. However… she hesitated because she didn’t want to be alone with Ulrich. And Ulrich seemed to sense this too, tilting his head thoughtfully.

 

“Shall I bring it up with Mr. Motier here? I don’t particularly mind.”

 

Her heart twisted. Despite being its owner, it felt as though her heart was in another’s grip. Ah, it was because this was an unmistakable threat. Ulrich was subtly pressuring her to send Theodore away.

 

If she didn’t…

 

“Theo.”

 

“Yes?”

 

“Could you… leave us for a moment?”

 

Theodore’s eyes widened. He was astonished not only by the fact that someone with the name Altahart had come here but also by the implication that Lisbell knew him well enough to talk privately.

 

“Ah, sure. I’ll be outside, so please feel free to talk.”

 

Theodore bowed his head and exited the reception room. The sound of the door closing felt like a thin barrier between Ulrich and herself breaking. It was as if the protective layer that had provided some comfort by merely existing had crumbled.

 

“How have you been?”

 

Lisbell flinched at the warmth touching her cheek and stepped back.

 

Her back hit the closed door with a thud.

 

Ulrich’s hand, which had naturally cupped her cheek, found itself awkwardly suspended in the air. He looked at his empty hand and clenched and unclenched it. Soon, he laughed as if it were amusing and withdrew his arm.

 

He turned and walked to the dresser in the reception room. He began to fiddle with the frames, nameplates, and figurines displayed there as if examining them. While he leisurely explored the interior, Lisbell stood frozen by the door.

 

“I hear this chapel is your wedding venue?”

 

“…Did you investigate me?”

 

“Investigate?”

 

His response indicated it was preposterous.

 

“I learned it all here. When I mentioned your name, the person who guided me here eagerly shared information. It was quite bothersome, listing things I wasn’t interested in.”

 

Shaking his head slowly as if expressing fatigue, he would occasionally let out a deflated laugh.

 

“How could you think of holding a wedding in such a shabby place…”

 



 

“But it oddly suits you, so I can’t complain.”

 

Lisbell clenched her fists tightly. She wondered why she had to listen to such evaluations from a man like him.

 

“Please answer me now.”

 

“Hm?”

 

“The reason you came here.”

 

“Ah, that.”

 

Despite the gravity of the subject, his demeanor remained nonchalant. Even when addressing the most crucial topic, he acted as if it was of no importance. His playful gestures with the antler-shaped figurine reflected this.

 

“Mrs. Osborne has collapsed.”

 

He said it with such a casual attitude that it was hard to accept.

 

“…Pardon?”

 

“To be precise, she collapsed and had to undergo emergency surgery. I covered the entire cost.”

 



 

“She’s currently in a hospital in Marnia, but there’s no sign of her regaining consciousness.”

 

Lisbell doubted her ears.

 

“Wha… What are you…”

 

“The doctor said she seemed to have been suffering from symptoms for quite some time. Did you not know?”

 

“Mother collapsed…”

 

No matter how many times she chewed over the sentences, they were hard to accept. But contrary to her mind, her chest stirred as if she had already understood.

 

Briefly, a hairline of doubt surfaced.

 

Could it be true?

 

Given that it was Ulrich delivering such tragic news, it was only natural to doubt. He had once deceived her using her mother. There was no reason he couldn’t do it twice.

 

Suppressing the tumult within, Lisbell stared directly at him.

 

“I’m sorry, but I can’t believe you.”

 



 

“My mother was healthy when we last met. Just a week ago, we talked on the phone.”

 

“That would make sense. She collapsed four days ago.”

 



 

“Previously, when she tried to bring me coffee, her hands shook and she broke the cup. Considering she never had tremors, it seemed odd. So, I intended to call a doctor from the capital. You know better than anyone that she recently submitted her resignation. I thought it was a final gesture of kindness.”

 

Kindness.

 

The word he used reeked of insincerity.

 

“But she refused, saying it was too much of a fuss for a mere favor. She found it burdensome. Like mother, like daughter; both fuss over trivial matters.”

 



 

“Anyway… she refused, and eventually, an accident happened. The doctor said if my secretary had found her any later, it would have been disastrous.”

 

What was he saying?

 

Though he kindly explained, Lisbell’s mind grew emptier. The only thing that came to mind was her mother’s complexion, which she had to ask about each time they met.

 

Saying she was fine, nothing was wrong. Her mother’s assurances had made her overlook the signs, thinking nothing more of them…

 

“I need to contact her.”

 



 

“I need to contact my mother.”

 

“I told you she’s unconscious.”

 

“You’ve already deceived me like this once beforei”


Chapter 37.

The shrill voice filled the reception room.

 

Despite being just a single sentence, Lisbell was out of breath. No, maybe she was suffocating. She couldn’t tell. It was that suffocating. If there were no eyes on her, she would have clutched her chest long ago.

 

But she didn’t want to show any weakness in front of Ulrich, that man. She wanted to hide it so he would never see it. Because his wickedness would dig into each of those aspects and try to use them as a weakness.

 

Ulrich clicked his tongue as if to be heard, looking at the resistant Lisbell.

 

“I understand you don’t trust me, but if you try to be hostile to the person who came all the way here to deliver this news, only Lisbell will be at a loss.”

 



 

“Even if you vent your meaningless anger here, it won’t bring your mother back to consciousness.”

 

He threw a heart-piercing statement and headed to the sofa in the reception room to pick something up. It was a bouquet that Lisbell hadn’t noticed, so focused was she on his presence.

 

Tuberose with long green stems and layers of pure white petals.

 

As he walked over, holding it in one hand, Lisbell reflexively stepped back. But her back was already against the door. There was nowhere else to retreat.

 

The remaining distance was just a step. He could touch her with a slight lift of his hand. Lisbell stiffened completely in astonishment. Ulrich grabbed her chin, lifting it so their eyes could meet.

 

“Why are you trembling like this?”

 



 

“I haven’t done anything…”

 

His subtly flowing tone wrapped around her limbs like a snake with fangs.

 

Ah, a strong sense of déjà vu.

 

It wasn’t much different from when she saw him in the backlight, kneeling. Knowing she couldn’t match him, yet having to face him, the psychological pressure crushed her insides. Like facing a vast ocean that threatened to swallow her whole if she made one wrong move…

 

“Listen well. I won’t say it three times.”

 



 

“Your mother is currently hospitalized at a hospital in Marnia after surgery, and I came here to inform you as her family.”

 

He tightened his grip on her chin.

 

Pulling her face to a slightly better angle, he kissed her pale cheek.

 

“If you don’t believe me, Lisbell can go to Marnia herself and check.”

 



 

“Oh, and this is a gift.”

 

He handed her the bouquet he was holding. The closer scent of the flowers was overwhelmingly strong. Was that why she felt so dizzy? Or maybe…

 

With those words, Ulrich left the reception room. Lisbell, left with the bouquet in full bloom, scrubbed her cheek with the back of her hand until it hurt. Yet, she couldn’t get rid of the feeling. Knowing nothing was actually there, she still couldn’t stand it.

 

“No.”

 

It must be a lie.

 

“That can’t be true…”

 

Mother was healthy.

 

There were no problems at all.

 

He might be trying to deceive her again and drag her into danger.

 

It must be.

 

It must be…

 

Lisbell, standing there, threw the bouquet he handed her to the floor.

 

With a thud, the loosely wrapped flower stems scattered around. The white petals lay scattered at her feet, looking both beautiful and miserable. Lisbell staggered, looking down at the sight.

 

No, no, no.

 

Repeating it to herself did no good. There was a thin thread of anxiety welling up, pushing through the narrow gaps of her consciousness.

 

What if it’s true?

 

What if, as he said, her mother suddenly collapsed and underwent surgery?

 

And what if she still hasn’t regained consciousness?

 

What then?

 

In a moment of weakness, her energy drained. Despite the intense contemplation, the conclusion was surprisingly clear. There was no other way. Unless she went to Marnia herself, she couldn’t confirm it.

 

Believing her mother would be fine while ignoring the increasingly thin face she’d seen from time to time, and as her guardian, she should be by her side if any problem occurred.

 

So, in the end.

 

I have to go to Marnia… again.

 

Lisbell’s head slowly dropped.

 

The white petals scattered around looked just like snowflakes. Was it summer or winter now? The seasons briefly overlapped, confusing her. Why was her whole body growing so cold if it was summer?

 

“Lisbell?”

 

Suddenly, her arm was grabbed.

 

Lisbell shuddered as if in a fit. The recollection of a night in Marnia made her react hypersensitivity.

 

“Ah, The, Theo.”

 

Her wildly shaking focus found its place only after confirming the person was her fiancé.

 

“What’s wrong? Why are you like this?”

 

The voice, genuinely worried about her, finally reminded her it was summer. A distinct warmth approached and embraced her. Lisbell looked at him with a melancholy heart.

 

Theodore’s palm cupped her cheek.

 

“More importantly, what’s this about Altahart? Isn’t he the owner of the villa where your mother works? Did you have such a close relationship for him to come looking for you? What was so urgent between you two?”

 

“Theo.”

 

Lisbell took a shallow breath and spoke slowly.

 

“I need to go to Marnia.”

 

“What?”

 

“I have something to confirm.”

 

She grabbed his hand, which was on her cheek, and pulled it down. Theodore, who seemed to follow gently, soon changed direction and grabbed her shoulder.

 

“Lisbell. Did something happen?”

 



 

“Your complexion is too pale. What did that man say to you?”

 

“I’ll tell you…”

 



 

“I’ll tell you everything when I get back.”

 

She didn’t want to share her burden of worries with Theodore when her mother’s situation wasn’t confirmed yet.

 

The future also depended on this situation’s outcome. For now, she assumed her mother would be safe, but if not, there were many things to consider.

 

If her mother required intensive care… Lisbell might have to reconsider this marriage for financial reasons.

 

Though her situation was one thing, she knew well how much Theodore had looked forward to this wedding. She couldn’t let him be rooted in anxiety for something that wasn’t yet certain. Hadn’t she caused him enough worry last time? She didn’t want to push him into another period of anxious waiting.

 

“So, can’t you wait for me?”

 

“Lisbell…”

 

“I know the wedding is soon. I promise I’ll be back before then.”

 

The strength left his hands on her shoulders. Feeling this, Lisbell bit her lip. The sensation of her body being roughly kneaded was vivid. Anxiety spread like a disease.

 

“Okay.”

 

His touch didn’t completely leave her. Instead, he moved behind and hugged her tightly.

 

“Okay, so calm down.”

 



 

“You’re still shaking.”

 

His voice, reminding her of her unnoticed state, was full of concern. Lisbell, who hadn’t reacted for a moment, buried her tear-streaked face in his comforting embrace.

 

I also want to stop trembling now.

 

I want to stop being driven by this unknown dread…

 

Words she couldn’t voice piled up inside her. They were as murky as a sewer.

 



 

Even with urgent thoughts, she couldn’t change the physical distance.

 

Clunk, clunk. It was unclear whether the shaking was from the train or her insides.

 

In such a state of anxiety, she finally arrived in Marnia.

 

As she hurried out of the station, she noticed a familiar figure cutting through the morning light.

 

Victor, the man she had briefly been introduced to in the garden of the villa last time, was standing by a stopped car, looking her way. It was as if he had come to pick her up. Confirming her suspicions, he bowed his head slightly in greeting.

 

“Master sent me.”

 

With a short explanation of his presence, he opened the back door of the sedan. Lisbell clenched her sweaty hands once, then released them.

 

Though she didn’t want to accept his kindness, she knew better than anyone that such resistance would be futile. She had to head to the hospital anyway, and this car would take her there. Moreover, she had to find traces of Ulrich Altahart, and his secretary was right in front of her.

 

Lisbell silently got into the car.

 

As it started moving, the small scenery of Marnia flowed in like liquid through the window.

 

It had become so blurry that it no longer looked beautiful to her.


Chapter 38.



It was a small city, so they arrived at the hospital quickly.

 

Lisbell followed Victor, who was leading the way.

 

The hospital in the morning was quiet. Every time she saw a patient lying in bed, she flinched. She feared that someone with their face hidden by the blanket might be her mother, a fear that lingered instinctively.

 

Victor didn’t stop walking for quite a while. He finally halted deep inside the hospital, in a secluded area. He opened a closed door and stepped aside as if to tell her to go in.

 

Lisbell didn’t step forward immediately but raised her head first.

 

Beyond the doorframe, like a boundary, sat a man in front of a window where a gentle breeze blew.

 

His golden hair, easily swayed by the slightest breeze, his straight posture, crossed legs, and the book in his hand created a refined appearance that seemed unbelievable for someone who had once trampled on her dignity.

 

He sensed her presence and lifted his head. Upon seeing Lisbell at the door, he closed the book with a soft “Ah.”

 

By then, Lisbell’s gaze had already shifted.

 

Her eyes, lukewarm when directed at the man, now trembled. Her face turned pale. She crossed the threshold, her cautious steps betraying the wariness that had kept her standing. Her dragging steps resembled someone being pulled by the nape.

 

“Uh…”

 

Her legs nearly gave out several times. Despite her staggering, Lisbell headed inside the room, determined to reach the one lying in bed.

 

“Mother…”

 

Reaching the bed, Lisbell collapsed. She couldn’t believe it, couldn’t accept that her mother was lying there like a living corpse, as the man had said. Her vision blurred with tears.

 

Lisbell pulled back the blanket and touched the hand beneath it.

 

She tried to feel the warmth of life, but it was different from her expectations. It was cold, like touching a corpse. Shocked, she quickly covered the hand with the blanket again. Covering it didn’t change anything, but she couldn’t face the reality. Lisbell, her face stained with tears, stared blankly at the bed.

 

“Why…”

 



 

“How much pain were you in…”

 

She could hardly breathe.

 

She hadn’t known her mother was in such a state until now, and the man who had taken care of her mother, who had been so dangerous, was the same one who had dragged her into this abyss. Now, he was the only one who could verify her mother’s condition.

 

The layered despair tightened around Lisbell’s throat.

 

“It seems the problem started with her bronchial tubes.”

 



 

“It would have been good if something had been done then, but it was neglected and spread to other organs, resulting in this critical state. I heard she was suffering from several illnesses even before she collapsed.”

 

Ulrich placed his book aside and approached the bed. He crouched next to Lisbell, who was sitting beside the bed, meeting her eyes.

 

“If you don’t believe me, I can call the doctor who operated on her to speak with you directly.”

 

His sharp gaze was another form of intimidation.

 

Accusing her of disbelief to her face, challenging her to deny the reality before her eyes.

 

Lisbell felt as though her nerves were coiling like they were facing a giant wave. Instinctively, she turned her head away, only for her chin to be grabbed and pulled back sharply.

 

“So, you should say thank you.”

 



 

“If it weren’t for me, your mother might be in a grave by now.”

 



 

“Despite me saving your mother’s life out of goodwill, Lisbell doesn’t even say thank you.”

 

It wasn’t a mere criticism but a quiet reprimand. Once elegant, now it wasn’t. In the room with just two people and a living corpse, he showed his true nature without hesitation.

 

Lisbell, her face soaked with tears, trembled. Ulrich smiled at her pitiable state. He wiped her wet cheek with his fingers, an act that felt almost coercive, forcing Lisbell to respond.

 

“Th-thank you.”

 



 

“Thank you for saving my mother.”

 

The man who instilled deep-seated fear within her, she had to thank him. The reality was wretched. She hated him for diluting her hatred in this way. With a twisted heart, Lisbell expressed her gratitude.

 

Could anything be more ambivalent?

 

The man who had temporarily crushed her was the same one who saved her mother. She had no choice but to thank him. It was like kneeling before resentment. The nauseating contradiction returned as invisible arrows tearing at her heart.

 

Satisfied with Lisbell’s compliance, he smiled serenely. His hand remained on her face, and so did his gaze. Ulrich’s eyes bore into her tear-streaked, distorted face.

 

When his gaze became unbearable, he finally withdrew his hand.

 

Lisbell quickly raised her arm to wipe her face.

 

From now on, she needed to pull herself together. Knowing her mother’s condition was so severe, there were many practical matters to consider.

 

In truth, she wanted to escape Ulrich’s realm as soon as possible. She couldn’t bear him grasping her weaknesses one by one.

 

“I will never forget this favor. I will take care of my mother from now on…”

 

“Who said you could?”

 

“…What?”

 

“Who said you could take her away?”

 

“What do you mean…”

 

“The surgery costs, the hospitalization fees…”

 



 

“You can’t be so naive. Are you so unaware of the ways of the world?”

 

Lisbell’s expression stiffened.

 

Yes, he was right.

 

It was a considerable amount of money that Ulrich had spent on her mother’s treatment, a sum that was meant for Lisbell’s family.

 

Knowing this, it was still hard to conceal her bitterness.

 

While in Marnia, he had willingly paid for even her personal expenses. She knew it was improper, but this amount wouldn’t even dent his finances. Yet, mentioning costs now was…

 

“Are you saying I should repay you?”

 

“Everything should be accounted for.”

 



 

“If word gets out that I let someone off without paying, what will happen to Altahart’s reputation as a businessman?”

 

Resigned to the inevitable, Lisbell closed her eyes tightly. Unwiped tears rolled down her pale cheeks. Ulrich watched her as if he might lick away the traces and then stood up.

 

He handed her a document from a table. With trembling hands, Lisbell took it.

 

The detailed figures made it clear it was an estimate from the hospital.

 

But the amount was much larger than she expected.

 

How could she pay this?

 

Even if she abandoned her wedding plans and used all her savings, it was doubtful she could cover it. Moreover, if she used all the money for the surgery, what about the future treatment costs for her mother?

 

The more she thought, the more hopeless it seemed.

 

Each clash with reality extended her thoughts into pathetic directions. Finally, she had to speak.

 

Could anyone in Rechem boast of wealth before this man? She rationalized, telling herself now wasn’t the time for pride, and her flimsy justifications became her only solace.

 

“I’m sorry, but I don’t have the means to repay…”

 

“No money.”

 



 

“Then what else?”

 

Was he talking about valuables? Lisbell, who had lived as a commoner with no interest in adornment, had none.

 

“I don’t have any.”

 



 

“I have nothing.”

 

“You have nothing?”

 



 

“You have your body.”

 

Before her hesitant words could reach him, Ulrich’s fingers touched her body. His hand moved to her chest, an area too intimate for anyone else to touch so casually.

 

“You have this body.”


Chapter 39.


Tap.

 

With a firm push, his playful gesture nudged her body backward.

 

Thus, Lisbell understood his hidden intention a beat too late. But even understanding didn’t mean she could act immediately. In reality, she was frozen with another meaning, unable to blink an eyelid.

 

“I could do it right now.”

 

The corners of the man’s eyes folded like a hawk’s wings. Smiling leisurely and beautifully, he slowly lowered his fingers.

 

From her chest to her solar plexus.

 

“I want to go in here.”

 

Past her navel, sinking in a little lower…

 

“…Ah…!”

 

The movement was sudden. It might even be called a desperate struggle.

 

The moment Lisbell realized where Ulrich’s hand was headed, she twisted her body. However, Ulrich, who had anticipated her move, pushed her down forcefully.

 

Her ash-gray hair spread across the cold hospital floor. Lisbell stared dazedly at the sinister figure looming over her.

 

“…I’ll pay it back somehow.”

 

“How?”

 

“By any means necessary…”

 

“By any means?”

 

“So please… don’t do this.”

 

“What have I done?”

 



 

“Naive and yet so scared…”

 



 

“See, I told you you’re just like a cat.”

 

Ah, his playful attitude only made her feel more ridiculous.

 

It wasn’t as if he was recklessly charging at her like last time, but she felt no relief. His eyes, looking down at her so detachedly, only reflected the primal joy of a beast cornering its prey for sport.

 

“My wedding is not far off.”

 

“I know, it’s late summer now.”

 

“I’m getting married…”

 

“Do you want me to congratulate you again?”

 

It felt like talking to a wall. Whether he felt the same way or not, Ulrich squinted as if he couldn’t understand, then let out a soft “Ah” and smirked. He lifted his damp fingers to her cheek.

 

“Do you think I’m asking you to give up on your wedding?”

 



 

“I’m not. If you want to be the bride in late summer, then go ahead.”

 



 

“But can you really do that?”

 

Though his tone was gentle, his words pierced her heart savagely.

 

“You plan to offer your body to another man and then still go through with your engagement? Do you think you can handle that with your weak nature?”

 

His sneer was biting.

 

He always ridiculed her.

 

Only now was she vaguely realizing that this was how he always saw her. Ulrich might have always been mocking her. She had thought he might be good at acting, but that didn’t mean she was exempt from being his target.

 

Ulrich’s flawless social skills might have extended even to her.

 

“You…”

 

As soon as she uttered a word, she realized her mistake. Her pale face and trembling lips revealed her fear.

 

“Have I made a mistake towards you?”

 

“Mistake?”

 

“If not, then why…”

 



 

“Why do you keep doing this to me…?”

 

It was no coincidence. Amidst the continuous incidents, Ulrich’s malice was vividly alive. Even if it was an elaborate plot to bring her down, it was no exaggeration.

 

The theft incident that never happened didn’t need to be mentioned, and this time was no different. While her mother’s condition might have been a coincidence, the fact that he covered the surgery costs to use it against her was entirely his intention and choice.

 

At this point, it was clear to her.

 

Ulrich continuously put her in difficult situations.

 

So, it was all intentional.

 

He had a natural talent for creating situations. With his background and money, there was nothing he couldn’t do, instilling both reverence and fear in her. No matter how much she struggled, she realized it was futile against him…

 

She couldn’t understand why, so she finally voiced it.

 

Mocking me, tormenting me, constantly pushing me like this. What is the underlying reason? Lisbell had no choice but to become genuinely curious.

 

“Why are you doing this?”

 

He looked as if he had been asked an obvious question.

 

“It’s simple.”

 



 

“I can do this.”

 

His eyes, now fully revealing their depths, were chillingly clear. They showed the truth, ideals, and reality. Ulrich truly, without a shadow of a doubt, believed it.

 

“Lisbell, you want to marry Mr. Motier.”

 



 

“I’m doing this because I want to.”

 



 

“Does desire need any more reason?”

 

He whispered, simply saying he wanted to, as if his words were an inexplicable noise in the distance.

 

Lisbell’s eyes fluttered. Tears that hadn’t yet dried flowed down her cheeks.

 

Ulrich eventually wiped them away with his fingers and brought them to his lips. Although it was just a drop of tears, it felt as if her soul had been sucked out… Was this feeling connected to the despair slowly consuming her whole body?

 

Cicadas chirping.

 

The sound of cicadas, a symbol of summer, disrupted the morning hospital atmosphere.

 

The intense sound would fade with time, as was the nature of the returning seasons.

 

But Lisbell couldn’t imagine the end of summer as clearly as before. No matter how hard she tried, it remained blurry as if smudged by her hands.

 

She was certain of one thing.

 

If she hadn’t set foot in Marnia, his paradise, she wouldn’t have ended up at this foolish crossroads.

 



 

Her pupils, widened in shock, gradually calmed.

 

People often make foolish choices even when they know they’re wrong.

 

That’s how Lisbell was now.

 

Her mother lying unconscious in a hospital bed, the secret she hid from Theodore, the insurmountable financial problems, and the precious future she still wanted to protect…

 

Cicadas chirping.

 

The sound of cicadas was still intense.

 

Summer, the season of breeding.

 

Lisbell couldn’t shake off the thought that her misfortune, which fell upon her suddenly, was also breeding like that.

 



 

“…Ugh.”

 

Her curled-up body shrank even more inward. Like a small pill bug rolling away after being tapped by someone’s foot, Lisbell only showed movements of wanting to hide somewhere. Each time the man’s persistent breath fell on her back, it was the same.

 

“Hah…”

 

His breath was as hot and heavy as if he had swallowed the scorching summer sun.

 

Each drop felt like a heavy rock, difficult to bear. It didn’t just settle; it poured down. The unusual temperature and rhythm made it clear what he was doing now.

 

“Ugh, Ah…!”

 

Lisbell, who was rubbing her forehead against the sheet, wanted to bury her face entirely to muffle the inevitable moans.

 

But just the other day, she had been severely scolded for trying to stifle her moans. The man had developed a new hobby of listening to her moans. Any attempt to disrupt his newfound pastime was met with harsh retribution.

 

Ulrich, exhaling warm breath, pushed aside the slip covering her back.

 

The rough feel of the lace trim on the slip was strange. Lisbell normally didn’t wear such lacy slips. The fact that she was wearing this and on this bed was entirely his doing.

 

Under the ‘repayment contract’, a few bedroom rules had been established.

 

First, when called, Lisbell must stop whatever she was doing and come to Ulrich’s bedroom. Second, she must wear a slip that was easy to remove.

 

Because of this, with just one movement of his hand, Lisbell had to expose her clean, dry back.


Chapter 40.


Ulrich poked at her sharply raised shoulder blade with his fingertip and pressed the soft flesh firmly with his penis.

 

“Uh…!”

 

Lisbell’s rounded shoulder line trembled. It wasn’t just there that convulsed. The lower part, filled with his entire length, also trembled as if strained.

 

“Lisbell, huh….”

 

In that state, he pressed his pubic bone fully against her perineum, making their lower bodies one. As he gently scratched the entrance with the veins on his penis, Lisbell, who was lying down, vibrated as if hit by a spark.

 

Ulrich, wearing a languid smile, rubbed and ground the deep spot with his glans fully inserted.

 

“Ha, ugh! Ah….”

 

“The place you feel is deep.”

 

“Huh, huh…!”

 

“I noticed you react when I touch deep inside your throat too.”

 

“Ah, Ah…!”

 

“I thought it was because it was your first time… but it seems you were born with this preference.”

 

It was Ulrich’s talent to speak elegantly yet crudely. Using that talent without filter, he grabbed her buttocks that curved temptingly. The slight flesh of her buttocks fit perfectly in his hand as he traced the overall outline.

 

Holding it tightly, not allowing any escape, Ulrich relentlessly pounded the inside. The penis, already covered in her fluids, squelched as it moved out, spraying sticky droplets.

 

Licking his lips, he observed the debauched traces. Twisting her buttocks until the flesh was mashed, he spread them wide, making the eager entrance, swollen with small wrinkles, more visible.

 

When he fumbled with one finger, feeling the fervent traces, Lisbell shrank her reddened nape. Smiling silently at her sensitive reaction, he adjusted his posture and thrust deeply into her inner wall.

 

“ugh! Ah, Ah…!”

 

Her split buttocks crumbled without resistance, struggling to contain his forearm-sized cock.

 

“Do you know that your belly tenses whenever I rub inside like this?”

 

“Uh, ung….”

 

A snicker. This time, a rather loud laugh descended. Lisbell was now afraid of his laughter. Ulrich no longer hid his sneer towards her. She feared what kind of ridicule it would be, a learned response from past experiences.

 

“You said you wanted to do it from behind first.”

 

“Uh, uh, ah, ah….”

 

“Was it all for this? Hm?”

 

He straightened his spine and slapped, slapped, slappedi pounded Lisbell’s buttocks as he thrust fiercely. Every time the tip of his penis, snaking its way through the curves, hit the stimulation point, white spots burst in her head. She could only clutch the hapless sheet and gasp.

 

No. It wasn’t for that reason at all.

 

The reason for insisting on this position….

 

“You’re trying to have fun in your own way… right.”

 

“Huh….”

 

“Well, I agree. If you’re going to have sex, it’s better to enjoy it together. Probing and touching where it feels good….”

 

Ulrich, panting shortly, quickly shook his pelvis. Each time the man thrust his hips fervently, Lisbell felt as if she were sinking deep somewhere. Even though she was on the bed, it felt like being driven into the cold, hard floor below, inducing a sense of self-loathing.

 

“Huh! Uh…! Ah… uh…!”

 

A large hand crawled inside her nearly stripped slip. Already overwhelmed with tingling and heat, she was disoriented, but his hand still grasped her breast, hitting the peak. The pulling sensation, as if to tear the scant flesh away, spread a numbing sensation. His hands, twirling her nipples, immediately soothed the pain. It was a disorienting caress.

 

“Ah, uh! Ugh…!”

 

“Ah… tight again. Unless you’re trying to turn me into a premature ejaculator, why don’t you relax a bit.”

 

Ulrich, snickering, grabbed her breasts firmly without wasting any motion and thrust forcefully.

 

Between Lisbell’s reddened buttocks, Ulrich’s clean penis moved in and out relentlessly.

 

As a result, only Lisbell’s pubic hair, moistened with fluid, stuck to her skin. Ulrich, finding the hair similar in color to her own, fondled it curiously while continuing to thrust.

 

Every time he forcefully penetrated the pleasingly tight interior, a thrilling tension pulled at the back of his neck. Like an animal savoring a taste, he licked his lips multiple times, thumping her buttocks rhythmically with his pelvic bone.

 

Even a single thrust pushed so deep that the pressure of organs being squeezed was unrelenting. This made Lisbell, while being penetrated, subconsciously feel her lower abdomen several times. Though knowing it was impossible, she worried her belly might bulge bluntly.

 

“Huh, ah, ah, Ah…!”

 

The erratic speed, alternating between fast and slow like a playful game, began to quicken again.

 

This time, it felt a bit different. Lisbell sensed he was ready to release the built-up sexual tension and clenched her toes, bracing her lower belly.

 

He twisted her erect nipples, hoping she’d better swallow his swollen penis. The force was such that her coral-colored breasts might be pulled out whole. Sometimes he would neglect to exert force where needed and, conversely, handle delicately areas that needed careful attention roughly.

 

“Aah! ugh! ah! Ah, Ah…!”

 

Lisbell’s high-pitched moans filled the dark bedroom as Ulrich, grabbing her split buttocks, pulled back. His penis, hard with imminent ejaculation, swelled. The robust organ barely exited, scratching the wet entrance.

 

As Lisbell gasped, her prone body was grabbed, flipping her vision upside down.

 

Having kept her eyes closed throughout the ordeal, the invading light in her barely opened eyes was faint. Unable to gather her sprawling limbs, Ulrich grabbed her chin.

 

“Time to do it.”

 

And third, instead of ejaculating inside, she must always receive his semen orally.

 

Lisbell, with her moist eyelids trembling, slowly parted her lips.

 

Straddling her face, Ulrich looked at her red, crumpled eyes and stroked his trembling penis. His hand movement was obscenely suggestive.

 

The veins on its surface pulsated violently. The thick shaft and the split testicles below seemed impatient to release their fluid, responding obscenely.

 

He shifted his gaze to her slightly open lips and stiffened tongue. As if imagining a rough suck, he eyed her fiercely and pressed his blunt glans into her small mouth.

 

“Uh, ugh….”

 

White semen spurted out thickly. Not a single drop of the arousal byproduct escaped Lisbell’s mouth.

 

The sticky taste sweeping through her mouth was torturous. Knowing he wouldn’t like it, Lisbell nonetheless couldn’t help but frown.

 

He smirked, touching her face, which was marred with unsightly wrinkles.

 

“Warm.”

 



 

“Lisbell seems to have a knack for taking things in, either from above or below.”

 

Ulrich, making that comment about Lisbell’s mouth filled with his glans, didn’t withdraw immediately after ejaculating but lightly shook his hips. Although only the glans was inserted, its sheer size made it feel like her mouth was completely full. It was like having someone’s clenched fist in her mouth.

 

The overwhelming weight of the penis, threatening to tear her inner walls of mouth, made Lisbell struggle.



Chapter 41.


Ulrich persistently shook his waist to extract all the liquid before finally pulling the tip out of her mouth.

 

As the accumulated semen inside was pushed out, the white mucus trailed along his organ and her parted lips. Ulrich chuckled at the messy sight and gestured to his genitals.

 

“Will you lick it clean?”

 



 

“You promised to eat it all.”

 

Lisbell stared at him with teary eyes before slowly sticking out her tongue. As she extended her tongue like a cat to lick his erect glans, she felt like a cheap prostitute selling her body for a few coins.

 

Wanting to break away from these self-destructive thoughts, Lisbell hurriedly licked his glans.

 

Ulrich, letting out a deep moan, adjusted the position of his head to make it easier for her to lick.

 

Her soft, wet tongue grazed the thick skin of his glans, the erotic curves on the top, and the small urethral opening in the center.

 

Though slightly softened after one ejaculation, his penis quickly became stimulated and began to swell again under the delicate movements of her tongue. Fully aware of his reaction, Lisbell closed her eyes in despair. Even in this situation, fearing his wrath, she couldn’t stop her tongue. It was the submissive stance of a weakling.

 

“You’re quite good at this now.”

 



 

“When I first told you to do it, you were drooling all over the place.”

 

After confirming that his penis was clean with no traces of semen, he pulled back. Lisbell, withdrawing her tongue which had become numb from the teasing, looked troubled.

 

Ulrich quickly grasped the reason. Like his straight, erect penis, his neatly sprouted fingers pried open Lisbell’s half-closed lips.

 

“…Ugh!”

 

“Swallow it.”

 

As expected, he confirmed the accumulated semen inside her mouth and sneered. Suspecting she would spit it out when he wasn’t looking, Ulrich pushed his fingers deeper.

 

The intruding fingers soon reached the back of her throat. Lisbell’s legs, pinned beneath him, thrashed as if she were being strangled.

 

Ignoring her violent resistance, Ulrich pushed his fingers deeper into her narrow, wet mouth.

 

Gulp.

 

The taste that finally went down her throat seemed to spread a fishy smell throughout her body.

 

Lisbell, having accidentally swallowed with his fingers still deep in her throat, couldn’t help but retch. As soon as he withdrew his fingers, which had been buried so deep that no knuckles were visible, Lisbell turned her body sharply.

 

“Ugh, ugh…!”

 

As she gagged and curled up, Ulrich gently stroked her tangled hair as if feeling sorry for her.

 

Comforting someone suffering from his actions was truly something only Ulrich could do.

 

Though she wanted to immediately brush away his hand, disgusted, she had no strength left. After a few dry heaves, Lisbell finally regained her composure, but before she could hold onto it, her body was dragged.

 

“Swallowing is nice and all.”

 

“…Ung…”

 

“But it’s a bit disappointing that I can’t kiss you afterward.”

 

“Ung… ugh.”

 

“Sucking on Lisbell’s tongue is surprisingly pleasant.”

 

His gaze, staring at her still-wet lips, was displeasing. Despite his penchant for bizarre acts, it seemed he couldn’t bring himself to kiss her mouth filled with his own semen.

 

Instead, he bit her nipples, visible through the thin slip.

 

“Ung…”

 

Lisbell’s hands grabbed his shoulders as if to push him away. Her normally numb nipples felt a sharp thrill from just one flick of his tongue.

 

A man who pulled her to bed every single day, he never forgot to torment and nibble at her breasts. Despite her complaints, he never let go once he bit down.

 

He showed such attachment that sometimes he would bury his face in her flat chest and dawdle.

 

Due to these frequent teases, her breasts had become so sensitive that even a slight pinch or bite could make her back twist.

 

“Mm, mm…”

 

Lisbell moaned under him as he persistently licked her nipples through the slip. It was her desperate attempt to resist the strange sensation.

 

Has it been about two weeks?

 

Since they began sleeping together.

 

The pain that had dragged her to a living hell on the first night was, fortunately or unfortunately, no longer present. After a few nights, Ulrich learned her sensitive spots, and his quick, efficient lovemaking left Lisbell trapped in waves of unfamiliar pleasure instead of the splitting pain.

 

And each time she realized she was feeling it, she was filled with crushing self-loathing.

 

Feeling sexual pleasure from another man’s touch, not Theodore’s, in such a demeaning way, was unthinkable.

 

She was no different from a beast driven only by instinct.

 

Yet her body, betraying her reason, continued to commit this unimaginable act. The burden on her conscience grew heavier each day.

 

“Ha, ugh… stop…”

 

“Stop?”

 

Ulrich, catching her slip of the tongue as she inadvertently voiced her restraint while struggling, asked back as if to catch her off guard.

 

He lifted his head slowly, letting go of her nipple through the slip. His crooked gaze sent a shiver of unease, and then he smirked.

 

“You don’t like it through the clothes?”

 

He immediately pulled the slip aside. Her barely protected breasts were now fully exposed. Burying his nose in her non-existent cleavage, he circled his tongue around the protruding tip.

 

“Ah…!”

 

Lisbell twisted her waist and let out a scream.

 

The difference between being sucked through the clothes and directly on her skin was subtle yet significant. The transfer of saliva from his tongue and how it trailed was conveyed clearly.

 

Indeed, as if substituting for the kiss he couldn’t give, Ulrich stubbornly clung to her nipples.

 

Even the slightest friction from his tongue was enough to make her waist twist, showing how sensitive her breasts had become. He deliberately made a loud sucking sound as he slid his hand down to her groin.

 

“Ung, stop… ah…”

 

Resistance was futile. Before she could even fully voice her protest, two fingers entered her at once, spreading her open.

 

Already melted from several rounds of him tonight, her inner walls parted easily as he scissored his fingers and licked her nipples.

 

Lisbell threw her head back. At some point, her mouth had filled with saliva, unable to swallow as her breath hitched. Meeting Ulrich’s gaze, she knew she couldn’t stop.

 

“No, I don’t want this…”

 

“You don’t want it?”

 

“Ung, ah! Ung…”

 

“Yet you’ve already taken three fingers?”

 

Without her realizing, the number of fingers increased to three, stretching and probing her inner walls. His fingers skillfully targeted her sensitive spots, making her shake her head. The more violently she reacted, the more Ulrich teased her nipples and moved his fingers faster inside her.

 

“Ah, ah… ahh… mm…”

 

Her groin grew wetter as her body trembled with each pulse. She felt her insides heating up, a terrifying and unpleasant sensation.

 

In the end, her face turned red as she clung to Ulrich’s arm.

 

Finally, the fourth finger.

 

“Ah, from behind, ah, from behind, Ulrich…i”

 

The position was always so she couldn’t see his face, with Lisbell on her stomach.

 

As could be inferred, the rules of their bed play were a strict compromise. For every term from Ulrich’s side, there was a term considering Lisbell’s stance.

 

She saw the contract on the day she returned to this villa and signed it with trembling hands in front of him. How did he react?

 

Ah…

 

He smiled, just like now.

 

Mocking her desperate behavior, Ulrich firmly held Lisbell’s trembling thighs and thrust inside as he pleased. The three fingers, now moving rapidly, turned into a thick rod, tearing her insides apart.

 

“Ah, ah, ah… ah!”

 

Feeling the mess between her legs, goosebumps rose on her skin. Again, the familiar mixture of strange pleasure and self-hatred overwhelmed her.

Chapter 42.


“Wasn’t it just for sex that you wanted to do it from behind?”

 

“Ah, ah, ah, yes…i Ahhh…i”

 

“This isn’t sex. This is, um….”

 

While prodding and rubbing her wet hole with three fingers, he casually remarked.

 

“This is me helping Lisbell have some fun.”

 

“Ung, ah…i Ah, Ah…!”

 

He relentlessly played with Lisbell’s insides as she desperately tried to escape.

 

When she curled up on her side, he continued his actions by lifting one of her overlapping legs. Eventually, he removed two fingers, leaving only his longest middle finger to stir the murky liquid flowing below.

 

“Ah, ah… ugh…!”

 

Caught in a near ecstasy, Lisbell reached a trembling climax.

 

As soon as she came, Ulrich withdrew his finger, which had been twisted so erratically it defied rhythm. An opaque liquid trailed down his fingertip.

 

“Haa, ha…”

 

Her vision blurred, her mind shattered.

 

The lingering pleasure left all over her body pushed her deeper into a twisted guilt.

 

Every time she did this with Ulrich and felt it intensely, Theodore’s face would come to mind.

 

It felt like committing adultery.

 

She couldn’t stop crying when suddenly her waist was grabbed, and she was dragged, face down, onto the sheets.

 

The strength spreading her buttocks revealed an unseen lust.

 

An insatiable, grotesque sexual appetite.

 

A terrible sensation of a slippery, massive volume slowly pushing into her cleft.

 

Lisbell buried her tear-streaked face in her arm and quietly wiped away her tears.

 

Opening her weary eyelids, Lisbell realized she had fallen asleep. Curled up in the middle of the bed without a pillow, she blinked sleepily.

 

Just then, the sound of water from beyond ceased.

 

Soon after, Ulrich, with a nightgown over his sculpted naked body, appeared, running his hand through wet hair.

 

“Did you wake up?”

 



 

“You were sleeping so quietly, I thought you might be dead.”

 

Ulrich, making a statement that seemed like a joke, nonchalantly approached the drink table in the bedroom.

 

He always had a whiskey after sex. Though, it seemed not just because of sex. He appeared to be a drinker. Eventually, she found out that there were drink tables with decanters scattered throughout the villa.

 

Today too, he filled his glass generously and took a sip before turning back to the bed.

 

Seeing him, Lisbell pushed away the loosely covered blanket and tried to sit up. The idea that she had slept soundly here felt absurd.

 

Having just woken up, she intended to return to her own bedroom but couldn’t manage it. Every action, from bracing herself on the sheets to lifting her torso and properly sitting down, was more exhausting than she had imagined.

 

The pain from the sex might have subsided, but the lingering muscle soreness was still there. Honestly, she felt too weak to even move a finger. Thinking about returning to her bedroom on another floor made her sigh.

 

More than returning, she wanted to wash away his remnants on her body. When she touched her abdomen to pull off the blanket, she felt something sticky. As soon as she wiped it with her palm, she knew what it was.

 

It was Ulrich’s semen.

 

She remembered it vividly. She had fallen asleep during the act, so he had ejaculated all over her body as if in frustration.

 

Her entire body felt dirty with traces of fatigue and bodily fluids. But she was so exhausted that she couldn’t do anything about it. Even though she was awake, she felt like she was still wandering in a dream.

 

“Want a drink?”

 

Ulrich, watching her from a tilted stance, shook his empty crystal glass.

 

Lisbell touched her lips.

 

It was strange. She hadn’t been conscious of it a moment ago, but the mention of a drink made her want to rinse her mouth. It felt as if the semen he had discharged into her was still filling her mouth.

 

She wanted to run to the bathroom and rinse, but in her current state, even that seemed impossible.

 

Besides, would water be enough to rid her of this taste?

 

She thought it might be better to use the high-proof alcohol, so Lisbell nodded slightly.

 

He poured the crystal glass generously. The sound of pouring filled the quiet bedroom. The space that had been filled with her moans and his breath always felt awkward.

 

Lisbell took the glass he handed her.

 

As soon as she carefully swallowed a sip, she started cough!ng violently.

 

Lisbell grabbed her throat. It was just a sip. Yet it felt like her esophagus was burning. She had heard whiskey was strong but hadn’t imagined it would taste this harsh.

 

The glass slipped from her grasp and rolled off the bed, spilling its contents and wetting the floor. Ulrich looked at the spill and then at Lisbell, who was still cough!ng with a flushed face, and burst into laughter.

 

“…ugh…!”

 

The next moment, he pounced on the bed.

 

As his damp blonde hair rustled, Lisbell’s body had already crumpled. He had jumped on her and hugged her tightly.

 

Lisbell felt like dying in a different way.

 

Her whole body already ached as if trampled, and now, on top of the effect of the strong liquor, being pinned down by a much larger man left her disoriented.

 

But her dismay was brief; Lisbell wriggled to escape his embrace.

 

“Let go, let me go. I need to go back to my room….”

 

“Why not stay here tonight? You look too weak to even get up.”

 

Lisbell opened her mouth but then closed it firmly.

 

From her experiences, she knew he was very stubborn. Once he decided on something, he would make sure to see it through. He might say she could do as she wished, but the reality was different. She already saw him in a negative light.

 

Dragging her tired body into an argument, risking another session starting, would be bad for her. She was so exhausted that she could fall asleep immediately if she closed her eyes.

 

I must smell right now….

 

Unlike Ulrich, who had cleaned up, she hadn’t even gotten rid of the sweat accumulated overnight. Falling asleep during sex meant she wasn’t in a clean state.

 

Thinking about it briefly, she changed her mind.

 

Lisbell remembered the repayment contract he had handed her in the parlor. He had proposed replacing her debt with sexual intercourse, specifying the term clearly.

 

The period extended to late summer, almost the end of autumn.

 

Seeing that, Lisbell realized clearly that contrary to his words about not interfering with her marriage to Theodore, he was intent on ruining it. Otherwise, there would be no reason to keep her until late summer.

 

“The period written there could change.”

 



 

“If I get tired of you before then, the contract will end there.”

 

His nonchalant comment while holding a cigarette had struck her deeply. For her, a situation shaking the foundation of her life was just a whim for him, ending whenever he got bored.

 

Was he telling her to have hope or to sink into despair?

 

His words left her uncertain.

 

Ultimately, both despair and hope remained for Lisbell. The nightly endurance was despair, while hope was naturally….

 

[- What do you mean, Lisbell? Postpone the wedding?]

 

When she signed the contract, she didn’t cry. But tears welled up when she called Theodore.

 

Listening to his urgent voice on the other end, Lisbell couldn’t respond immediately. Leaning against the wall, hearing him ask what happened made her feel choked up.

 

All she wanted was to marry Theodore.

 

But why had things turned out this way? Lisbell felt confused and overwhelmed, fearing she might never escape this maze. By the time she realized, her face was already drenched in tears.


Chapter 43.


Drip, drip.

 

I lifted my head hurriedly after only watching the traces of falling droplets on the floor. Theodore’s insistent questioning, sensing something was wrong from my lack of response, demanded my attention.

 

[What’s going on? Are you in trouble? If you’re in Marnia right now, I’ll come to you. Lisbell. Let’s meet and talk.]

 

“No.”

 

[No?]

 

“Don’t come, Theo. You… there’s no need for you to come here.”

 

Swoosh~

 

Guilt stirred again, like a mischief.

 

What started as a small seed had grown to the size of a fist, pounding relentlessly against Lisbell’s heart.

 

[No need…?]

 

Such words born from that kind of heart only led to awkward misunderstandings.

 

Lisbell bit and released her lips as she listened to his reaction over the receiver.

 

Even in this moment, intense dilemmas flooded her mind.

 

Should I tell Theodore everything?

 

Should I tell him that this is happening to me, that the current situation is such that I cannot leave Marnia, that my mother’s life is tied to that man, and that I cannot irresponsibly abandon her to return to you…?

 

Her fingers gripping the receiver turned pale.

 

Soon, a dry laugh slipped quietly.

 

What If I tell him?

 

If I tell him, will all this misfortune that has come to me be resolved?

 

No.

 

Of course, if it were Theodore, he would surely step in wholeheartedly. If I told him I was held hostage for my mother’s surgery costs, he would help with all he had, even if it meant using the funds meant for the wedding. But even if he stepped in, the wedding would still have to be postponed.

 

Even if we managed to repay my mother’s surgery costs and secure our livelihood, what about after that?

 

The repayment contract Ulrich presented included all hospitalization fees for the specified period. The price for her being in his bed was that high. The thought that her mother’s future treatment costs would not be insignificant kept her from stopping such self-destructive judgments.

 

Misfortune doesn’t lessen when shared. It only increases the burden, creating two hardships instead of one. Comforting herself would be brief, but the heavy reality would continue to tighten its grip.

 

That’s why misfortune is called misfortune.

 

Lisbell thought it was enough for her alone to tumble within this misfortune. She loved Theodore too much to drag him further in.

 

In reality, she knew well that, for his sake, she should be asking for a breakup to prevent him from getting hurt any further.

 

But she couldn’t bring herself to do it.

 

Now, this was the only hope she could hold onto…

 

If even this were gone, she wouldn’t be able to endure her time in this villa. Even if it was merely a result of her selfishness, without that small straw, she had nothing else to grasp…

 

“Sorry, Theo. I’ll explain everything later. I’d like to postpone the wedding date to winter.”

 

Her selfishness manifested so clearly. Even if it seemed difficult, she couldn’t utter the words suggesting a breakup. She was fully aware that Theodore might end up disappointed in her and take such a step himself, but still…

 

In truth, she knew Theodore wouldn’t do that.

 

Since she was the one who loved him the most, having known him to always be kind and gentle.

 

That phone call was her last contact with Theodore.

 

And two weeks had passed since then.

 

Lisbell recalled the phone call she ended without hearing an answer and shivered. A strong arm pulled her back firmly by the waist. Ulrich’s gestures were always like this. Whenever he wanted something, he had to pull it right in front of him, never hiding his rudeness.

 

If he were someone who understood such things, he wouldn’t have put her in such trouble in the first place. This method had been ingrained in Ulrich since childhood.

 

“Lisbell, your hair is tangled again.”

 

Ulrich, who was hugging her warmly from behind, buried his face in Lisbell’s ashen hair, tickling her skin.

 

“It tangles so easily.”

 



 

“Is it because it’s thin and wavy…”

 

He pointed out her flaws, but his actions were contrary. He swayed his face leisurely as if enjoying something pleasant.

 

Lisbell closed her eyes, ignoring his warm breath on the back of her head. She wanted to fall asleep like this, but she was bothered by Ulrich constantly stroking her flat lower abdomen with his broad palm. She had an uneasy feeling that it would soon change its demeanor and threaten her.

 

“Do you know the large farm in Crimpford?”

 

So, she couldn’t easily fall asleep, and Ulrich suddenly asked. Lisbell didn’t answer. It seemed he wasn’t expecting a reply as he continued nonchalantly.

 

“When I was a child, my father took me there to broaden my horizons.”

 



 

“I didn’t expect much, but the farm’s scale was impressive. The green fields stretched endlessly to the horizon.”

 

Her head felt heavy and dizzy. Could a single sip of whiskey make her drunk? Lisbell curled up inwardly. Ulrich persistently stuck to the back of her head, following her like a caterpillar. Occasionally, he stretched out his arms and pulled her curly hair.

 

“While my father was meeting the farm owner, I wandered around, exploring the outdoors. Do you know what amazed me the most?”

 

I don’t know.

 

And I don’t want to.

 

One sip had made her mind feel loose, while this man’s pronunciation and speech were perfectly intact. Was this rambling a drunken behavior? I don’t know. I just don’t want to know.

 

“It was the cotton field. It was a hot season like now, and the cotton bolls were in full bloom.”

 



 

“The white bolls looked as if snow had fallen in summer.”

 

What he said kept reminding her of someone, making it harder to kill her consciousness.

 

Theodore, who was born as the son of a textile factory owner. He, too, often talked about the farms and cotton fields in his hometown, just like Ulrich was doing now.

 

Thinking of Theodore while being entwined naked with another man on the bed made her feel disgusted with herself.

 

“Lisbell’s hair feels like the cotton bolls I held then.”

 



 

“It’s a cute texture…”

 

The slight intoxication and the heavy drowsiness combined, and her mind was completely dazed. She wished the sound would slowly fade, but unfortunately, everything was clearly audible. It was exhausting.

 

The words she just heard were something Theodore had once said.

 

He had told her that her naturally curly hair often tangled and was annoying to manage, but he found it cute like a cloud. Her fiancé had once uttered such ticklish words.

 

Now, hearing Ulrich dirty those words Theodore had once said, while mentioning things that reminded her of Theodore, made her feel cursed.

 

Her loosening mind gradually lost strength.

 

Just before falling asleep, she envisioned Theodore’s radiant smile towards her like the sun. In her fading consciousness, she ran into his arms.

 

A mirage-like sensation that would disappear the moment she grasped it.

 



 

Swoosh-

 

Twisting both ends of a soaked towel, water droplets fell refreshingly. Lisbell, who watched it silently, folded the towel twice, leaving it with just enough moisture. Then, she carefully wiped her mother’s arm that was sticking out from under the blanket.

 

If only her mother’s eyelids would flutter even once, she would have no more wishes, but her mother’s face remained as serene as always, continuing her quiet sleep.

 

After the surgery, Mrs. Osborne had been transported to this villa the moment Lisbell signed the contract. Now, in this cozy bedroom, she received lavish care beyond their means.

 

Under normal circumstances, such expensive medicine being administered morning and night, and the personal physician of the Altahart family coming to Marnia to check on her daily, would be unimaginable.

 

But even in such a perfect environment, her mother showed no sign of waking up. Lisbell’s days passed by caring for her mother. Except for the times when Ulrich summoned her to his bedroom, she spent all her time here.



Lisbell stared blankly at her mother, who lay as if only her body remained, devoid of her soul.

 

“…Mother.”

 

Knowing there would be no response, she still opened her mouth. Her parched and cracked voice, a testament to her broken expectations, echoed in the beautiful yet desolate room before fading away.

 

Lisbell hesitated again as she moved her hand, which had paused for a moment.

 

Why didn’t you tell me?

 

If her mother were to regain consciousness, that was the first question she wanted to ask. It simmered with many emotions.

 

There was guilt for not recognizing the condition of her only family member, relief that her mother had survived in some way, and, on the other hand… a thinly veiled question of why her mother hadn’t informed her earlier, leaving her to be caught like a hostage in a man’s grasp.

 

Lisbell, lost in thought, shook her head.

 

The strange thoughts made her shrink back. Almost scolding herself, she diligently continued to clean her mother’s body.

 

Her mother’s frame, usually hidden beneath clothes, was emaciated. It was like a fragile straw that couldn’t withstand the harsh winter winds.

 

Lisbell bit the inside of her cheek and quickly pulled down her mother’s dress.

 

After making a round of the bed to clean her mother, she sat back in the chair. She hung the now dry towel over the basin and picked up a book she had taken from the study.

 

Opening to the page she had left off, she cleared her throat. She worried that her hoarse voice from the previous night’s distress might sound unpleasant to her mother.

 

Even though her mother was unconscious, Lisbell wanted her to know she was there, so she always read aloud quietly. Today was no different. Her slightly husky voice filled the silent room like a constant background noise.

 

She was about to turn a page full of lines of text.

 

Late summer wind blew through the open window. Her loose ash-gray hair swayed gently.

 

Lisbell lifted her eyes from the book.

 

The midday sun blazed fiercely in the sky. At such moments, Lisbell often felt dazed. She was engulfed in thoughts, wondering what she was doing in such a peaceful scene.

 

Really, what am I doing now?

 

Although she was sitting upright, it felt like she was faltering like someone who had lost their balance. As she realized that the previously stifling hot wind of Marnia no longer felt so intense, she felt more disoriented.

 

The realization that the summer she had once eagerly awaited was passing by so meaninglessly deepened this feeling.

 

Knock, knock.

 

An unexpected knock approached like an unwelcome guest.

 

Lisbell hurriedly turned to the door. Ulrich, whose appearance she hadn’t noticed, was leaning against the door with his arms crossed.

 

It felt strangely surreal for him to be in her mother’s bedroom. During the week she spent caring for her mother, he had never shown his face here.

 

She didn’t know the reason, but she was just grateful. She no longer wanted to be in the same space with him and her mother. The frustration from the hospital room, which had been so brightly lit that she felt even more insignificant, still lingered deeply within her.

 

“You were here.”

 

His tone was monotonous, as if it were obvious she was there.

 

Lisbell closed the book and stood up. Even though he hadn’t completely entered the room, it felt uncomfortable for the three of them to be together.

 

“You have a visitor, Lisbell.”

 

As she was about to leave and ask about the visitor, Ulrich spoke first.

 

Visitor?

 

Noticing her puzzled look, he added with a smile.

 

“Theodore Motier.”

 

Lisbell’s steps halted abruptly. Ulrich tilted his head, not taking his eyes off her face. Leaning against the wooden door, he continued to smile enigmatically.

 

“Your fiancé is here.”

 

As Lisbell stood frozen in disbelief, Ulrich knocked on the door again. The knocking sound seemed like a command to snap her out of her daze.

 

Finally, Lisbell, whose vision was blurred, muttered.

 

“Theo… is here?”

 

“Yes.”

 



 

“I’ve instructed him to wait in the drawing room.”

 

Theodore was… in the drawing room, in this villa. Her fiancé was in the same city, the same area, the same building. What should have been an exciting prospect felt eerily disturbing. Lisbell unconsciously rubbed her arm.

 

“Are you going to meet him?”

 



 

“If not, I’ll send him away.”

 

“Noi”

 

She hastily grabbed Ulrich as he interpreted her silence and turned to leave.

 

“I can’t… just send him away…”

 

She quickly understood why Theodore had come all the way here. If it had been her, she would have done the same. If he had suddenly left saying he had an urgent matter and then only sent a message to postpone the wedding, she would have done the same. So, there was no need to ponder why he was here. The answer was in her actions.

 

Ulrich watched Lisbell in silence. His dry gaze, like sand in the desert, did not waver from her confused face.

 

He soon smiled subtly and entered the bedroom.

 

“Alright, then let’s meet him.”

 

Lisbell backed away as he approached. But Ulrich, with his long strides, caught her arm first.

 

Without a moment to react, she was dragged and seated somewhere. It was the vanity table that stood like a decoration in a corner of the room.

 

“Ouch…”

 

As his hands suddenly dug into her scalp, Lisbell reflexively bit her lip. Her loose ash-gray hair, now untied, gathered under his skillful hands.

 

He combed through the stray hairs and tidied the messy parts before loosening the tie around his neck.

 

Just before summer, he had often left his shirt buttons open freely. But at some point, he had started wearing ties, mostly black ones, similar to the one Lisbell had once given him as a gift. Lisbell decided not to care about him anymore.

 

Ulrich gently untied his tie and used it to tie Lisbell’s hair.

 

“It looks much better.”

 

Was it because her unruly hair was now neatly tied, or because the tie he used was his own? His ambiguous words were puzzling.

 

Lisbell’s uneasy expression was reflected in the mirror.

 

“You know where the drawing room is, right?”

 

He grabbed Lisbell’s ponytail and kissed the nape of her white neck.

 

Their eyes met in the mirror.

 

His eyes were like a blue chain. The feeling of being bound tightly, just by looking, could only be described this way.

 

It could be an unconscious manifestation. The guilt she felt toward Theodore made her feel remorse just by facing those eyes.

 

As her entanglements with Ulrich increased, the secrets she couldn’t share with Theodore weighed her down like a heavy burden. Since arriving at this villa, she had never felt light-hearted or free from worry.

 

“Please, enjoy your time with your fiancé.”

 

Leaving behind these oddly elusive words, he exited the bedroom.

 

Lisbell, left alone, still couldn’t move. Her face in the mirror looked as pale as a sheet. She sat there, unable to do anything, until the church bells tolled, filling the entire villa with their sound. Finally, she managed to get up.

 

Because Theodore was waiting.

 

As the twelfth bell rang, Lisbell arrived in front of the drawing room.

 

Standing in front of the closed door, she couldn’t describe her feelings. The drawing room was where everything had begun. She had come to apologize on behalf of her mother for a crime she hadn’t committed….

 

Lisbell closed her eyes tightly and gently placed her hand on the door. Then she slowly pushed it open.

 

The drawing room in the afternoon was filled with small rays of light. In the wavering sunlit waves, someone stood up abruptly. The simple gesture conveyed feelings of joy, surprise, longing, and tenderness.

 

No, perhaps it was her own feelings.

 

“…Lisbelli”

 

It was no wonder, for her fiancé, who had always been like a mirage, was now truly in front of her.

* * *


It was Theodore.

 

It wasn’t a dream, but the reality of him.

 

Unable to believe it, Lisbell stood by the door for a long time, unable to react. Theodore couldn’t just stand there quietly watching. As soon as the door opened and Lisbell’s face appeared, he ran over and grabbed his fiancée’s hand.

 

“Lisbell.”

 

Warmth spread from where he touched her. Despite the season, the warmth that had somehow been elusive, felt like summer. This brought her dulled senses back to life.

 

“Theo. How did you get here…?”

 

“Of course, I came to see you.”

 



 

“I couldn’t accept that one phone call telling me you wanted to postpone the wedding. So, I came to ask you directly.”

 

Theodore suggested they sit down and led Lisbell into the drawing room.

 

At the end of the hallway, the unchanged sofa from the past greeted her. The memories of what happened here came back, making her stop instinctively. Fortunately, the reaction was so slight that Theodore didn’t notice.

 

In front of Theodore was a cup of coffee, seemingly prepared for a guest. There was no steam rising from it, suggesting it had gone cold, and it looked like he hadn’t taken a single sip. This reflected Theodore’s anxious state, causing her heart to ache.

 



 



 

She never imagined such a moment would come while being with Theodore. Holding hands, sitting close enough for their knees to touch, looking into each other’s eyes but unable to speak easily, feeling the awkwardness first and foremost.

 

The atmosphere was tense, unlike a couple who had promised to marry. Lisbell didn’t know how to break the silence and looked down slightly. She stared at the back of Theodore’s hand, tightly holding hers.

 

“Lisbell, look at me.”

 

“…Okay.”

 

What will he ask first?

 

Why are you here?

 

What exactly happened suddenly?

 

What’s the exact reason for postponing the wedding?

 

There were so many questions she couldn’t guess. And it saddened her that she couldn’t guess.

 

When she first saw Theodore, she felt like she had finally woken up from a nightmare. But now, stepping out of that shattered dream, a reality where she couldn’t take a single step forward awaited her like a beast with its jaws wide open.

 

All that remained was to be swallowed up.

 

So, she wanted to turn around and run away….

 

“Did you have something to eat?”

 

Among the many expected questions, Theodore asked something completely unexpected.

 

Lisbell doubted her ears for a moment. But the next moment proved there was nothing wrong. The familiar smile on Theodore’s face and his comforting hand caressing her cheek were evidence.

 

“You seem to have lost some weight. Your complexion doesn’t look good…. Are you eating well?”

 

“Theo.”

 

“Are you sick?”

 

As the affectionate questions continued, Lisbell felt herself breaking down bit by bit. The many fears that fueled her avoidance gradually subsided, leaving only a strong yearning.

 

Yes, Theodore was this kind of person.

 

She loved him because she knew his nature and this type of kindness. No, she still loved him. His kindness, which made her lean on him whenever something tough happened, hadn’t changed despite the uncertain situation.

 

“No, Theo. I’m fine. So don’t worry.”

 

“Really?”

 

“Yes, really…”

 



 

“I’m sorry. For making you come all the way here.”

 

“You don’t need to apologize. I came on my own.”

 

Lisbell leaned into the palm caressing her cheek and closed her eyes. Something lightly touched and then left her forehead. She knew it was his lips without even seeing.

 

They were officially engaged. Despite that, Theodore’s cautious and tender behavior contrasted sharply with someone who had treated her worse than a discarded toy.

 

“Lisbell… Is there something wrong with your mother?”

 

Before coming to the drawing room, she recalled wiping her arms and legs with a towel.

 

Even covered with soft bedding, her emaciated body and deathly pale complexion, almost devoid of any warmth, made her worry if she had already stopped breathing.

 

“No matter how much I think about it, I can’t guess anything else. Lisbell, you always think and worry about your mother, no matter where you are. If there’s nothing wrong with her, then you wouldn’t be acting like this.”

 

“Theo.”

 

“Tell me. Is something wrong with your mother?”

 



 

“Even if it’s not that, if something is troubling you, don’t hide it from me and tell me.”

 

What’s troubling me?

 

It’s this villa where we’re together right now.

 

Facing you like this in this prison-like place is unbearable.

 

So many visible things are pressing and weighing me down.

 

For example, the pavilion in the garden over your shoulder, the memories of crouching in this drawing room without feeling sunlight, even the tie that feels like it’s gripping my hair….

 

Because of all that, even the time spent with Theodore couldn’t be separated from the man. And that was the very hardship Theodore was painfully curious about.

 

Theodore suddenly clasped her hands.

 

“Lisbell,” he whispered softly, his voice full of sorrow. Through her tear-blurred vision, she saw Theodore gritting his teeth.

 

“Damn it. Something did happen, didn’t it? Why are you crying? Tell me what happened. I need to know. Okay?”

 



 

“This is just my guess, but… coming to Marnia, not answering about your mother…. Is it related to that man?”

 

Theodore continuously wiped her silent tears with his palm. He didn’t realize what kind of misunderstanding he was creating, but his face grew increasingly serious.

 

“Is it? It’s related to that man, the owner of this villa, isn’t it?”

 



 

“Is it a financial issue?”

 

Lisbell involuntarily curled her shoulders. Theodore, who was fully focused on her, couldn’t miss the change. His face hardened further. Certain he was right, Theodore resolutely grabbed her shoulders.

 

“I’ll help you, Lisbell.”

 



 

“I’ll help you.”

 

“What….”

 

“I’ll find a way to raise money. Even if we have to delay the wedding, I’ll gather as much as I can. If that’s not enough… I can contact my parents in Renbruck.”

 



 

“I heard my father recently signed a new farm and supply contract. I was worried about the sudden investment amount, but the broker who introduced the farm seems to be reputable. He trusted the investment, so once the contract is done, the factory sales will increase effectively in the first half of the year. If that happens, helping you won’t be difficult.”

 



 

“Lisbell, we promised to share our future. That naturally includes situations like this. You don’t have to handle everything alone.”

 

At that moment, she could read the responsibility in his eyes. Theodore wasn’t pretending. He was sincere. He genuinely dreamt of a future with Lisbell and was extending his hand to solve the difficulties she faced.

 

The hand she always thought was like a mirage was now a reality she could grasp right in front of her.

 

Lisbell stared at it blankly.

 

She believed she should never rely on him. She didn’t want to drag Theodore into this valley of misfortune, feeling like a cutting north wind at every turn. She firmly believed that was how she protected her love.

 

But he had come, he offered to help, and he was extending his hand.

 

The days she endured in this cruel and lonely space flashed quickly. The more she counted the tough and anxious days, the harder it was to ignore his hand.

 

Should I take it?

 

If I hold this hand, can I escape this valley of misfortune that won’t let go?

 

Hope, thought to be faded and blurred, surged anew, pulsing through her body.

 

Lisbell met Theodore’s eyes. She grimaced, unable to hold back the sob rising from deep inside.

 

“I, I….”

 

Her lips were just about to open.

 

Bangi

 

A gunshot echoed through the drawing room.


The lingering echo left by the sound was extremely sharp and intense. It felt like a drill boring into the brain. It was evidenced by the figures of the two people, frozen solid. Their pupils, containing only each other, trembled as if swept away by the wind.

 

Bangi

 

A gunshot rang out again.

 

The sound was so sudden and startling that it felt as if someone had fired a gun right next to their ears. But it wasn’t so. Only now, a little late, did the sense of distance set in. The space was strictly separated. The gunshot came from outside the window.

 

“What is it…?”

 

Theodore, seemingly just as bewildered, looked towards the window with a dazed expression. Seeing him react this way confirmed that the sound indeed came from outside.

 

So this space remained unharmed, but Lisbell felt overwhelmed as if she had been struck by it.

 

A moment from the past fiercely resurfaced.

 

The savage gunfire that suddenly assaulted the senses while walking down a hallway, just like now. When she peeked outside the window, startled, there was a man aiming at a target in a textbook-perfect stance.

 

“Is someone practicing shooting?”

 



 

“Lisbell?”

 

Theodore’s voice was intermittently cut off because the gunshots still invaded this space. He squinted one eye as if the noise was bothersome. Lisbell, looking at his face, thought of just one thing.

 

After the continuous gunfire sounds, the target board seen in a flash…

 

The pitiful target board, damaged almost perfectly with only the center deeply pitted as if hit every time.

 

Cold sweat trickled down her spine. She felt another chill. The brief summer she had reclaimed was quickly ebbing away like a receding tide. The season was breaking down again.

 

Even amidst this, the continuing gunfire sounded just like Ulrich’s sneering laughter, mocking her. It felt like the sound wasn’t just tearing at her ears but at her heart as well. Recalling his trivial stories she had half-listened to in the past.

 

“Do you know the large farm in Crimpford?”

 

“It was the cotton field. It was a hot season like now, and the cotton bolls were in full bloom.”

 

The topic that used to torment her by associating it with Theodore, so much that she wanted to pass out by forcefully pushing herself to drink, now prickled her sharply for no apparent reason.

 

“Lisbell, this sound….”

 

“Theo.”

 

“What?”

 

Theodore, stretching his neck to figure out where the sound was coming from, looked back at her. Lisbell saw a peculiar seed of despair in his face.

 

“Your father, the farm he newly contracted this time… is it the large farm in Crimpford?”

 

Theodore’s eyes widened.

 

“Yes. How did you know?”

 

Ah.

 

Ah.

 

Ah….

 

The myriad of thoughts occupying her mind scattered. The gunfire, which had been ringing in her ears like tinnitus, ceased. But Lisbell still felt as if she could hear something. Thump, thump, thump. A blunt but heavier throbbing than the gunfire hammered down her entire body like an ax.

 

She realized only a moment later.

 

It was her own heartbeat.

 

Even though the space was clearly separated, making it seem like only the savage sound was transmitted, it wasn’t so. Lisbell was surely torn apart by that gunfire. Anxiety and unease surged in like a black wave through the cracks of her shattered mind.

 

My misfortune has finally transferred to my fiancé.

 

When did it start?

 

The misfortune that swallowed me was now preparing to engulf my fiancé as well.

 

A shiver ran through her entire body.

 

“…Lisbell? Lisbelli”

 

Unable to bear it, she hunched forward, clutching her head. Her fingertips brushed against the frustratingly soft material of a necktie. Lisbell yanked at it neurotically, like someone screaming silently.

 

Her ponytail, leaving a mark, messily cascaded down. She looked at the necktie in her hand in despair.

 

Staring at the black necktie stretching horizontally across her eyes, Lisbell unconsciously grabbed her neck.

 

Her cautious movements gradually turned pathological.

 

Even though nothing was hanging there, she scratched furiously at her white skin until red drops of blood appeared. She was picking at her skin so much that flesh clung to her nails, but the panic splitting her mind was so dominant that she didn’t have time to feel the pain of her skin tearing.

 

“Ah….”

 

Then realization hit her in an instant.

 

It wasn’t just about the money.

 

Even if that were resolved, everything couldn’t be undone as if it never happened.

 

He meant for me to come to him willingly.

 

By betraying the trust with my dear fiancé and going to him directly.

 

Lisbell had already committed the act of betraying this relationship. She had done it. There was even an excuse. She did it to save her mother. She thought she had no choice at the time.

 

And that incident had very clearly turned into her weakness. The leash of this secret was in Ulrich’s hands. That’s why she kept feeling something was tied around her neck.

 

“Ha….”

 

“Lisbell? Are you alright?”

 

“Haha….”

 

A hollow laugh slipped out.

 

“Why? Are you in pain? Is it your head? Does your head hurt?”

 

She no longer felt any warmth from her fiancé’s careful touch. No warmth at all; even if she were at the bottom of a cold ocean, it wouldn’t be as chilling as this. The uncontrollable cold surged as if she had become a living ice block.

 

The trap that had taken her as its prey was silently laid at her feet.

 

As intricate as a spider’s web, as precise as a chessboard….

 

Her foolish self had stepped into it willingly, unaware, step by step. She didn’t even realize it when it was finally wrapped around her neck.

 

Going forward was checkmate, going backward was checkmate.

 

In chess, this was called a mate.

 

Yes, I’m exactly in that state now….

 

In a disheveled state, Lisbell stared blankly into space. Even in this moment, Theodore’s tender hand, with no fault to find, caressed her cheek as he called her name soothingly, “Lisbell,” and brushed back her tousled hair.

 

Feeling his touch silently, Lisbell slowly turned her head.

 

“Theo.”

 

“I’m listening. Tell me.”

 

“…Will you break off the engagement?”

 

The tender hand that had been stroking her sideburns as if prepared to accept anything froze. Lisbell, if she could, wanted to lean her cheek against that palm once more. But she couldn’t anymore. She realized too painfully that she couldn’t anymore.

 

“Now….”

 

“I asked you to break off our engagement.”

 



 

“Let’s break up, Theo.”

 

Holding onto Theodore any longer wasn’t love but obstinacy. As someone who loved him, she couldn’t commit such an ugly selfish act. It was clear that the path ahead couldn’t be a bed of roses, at least not for him, now that she had understood the underlying issues.

 

So this was the right thing to do.

 

It should have been like this from the beginning.

 

Driven by the desire to keep at least one thing within reach, she had done something she shouldn’t have. If she couldn’t correct it now, at least Theodore should be freed from this shadow.

 

She didn’t want to imagine the moment when the swamp holding her down would swallow even his ankles. So the answer was clear.

 

“What are you saying?”

 



 

“Why, why does it have to end like this? Just a moment ago….”

 

Holding her shoulders gently but firmly, Theodore, his face hardening, opened his eyes wide.

 

“You’re doing this on purpose, aren’t you?”

 



 

“You’re saying this because you don’t want to cause me any harm, aren’t you? You don’t mean it, right?”

 

His attitude was unusually earnest, and perhaps he was right; it contained a strong denial. A denial driven by his desperate belief that they couldn’t end like this, that she felt the same way.

 

And it wasn’t just words. His wavering eyes, the way he clasped his hands over hers on her lap, everything expressed his blind desire to confirm the solidity of their relationship.

 

“Theo….”

 

“Say it isn’t true.”

 



 

“Say it was a slip of the tongue.”

 



 

“Lisbell, it’s alright. I told you just a moment ago. You don’t have to feel guilty. It’s all on me. It’s my choice, my decision. So you shouldn’t feel any burden….”

 

This was the second time.

 

Facing a situation where she had no choice but to make a foolish decision, knowing it was wrong.

 

“I don’t love you anymore.”

 



 

“That’s why, Theo.”


Theodore was frozen in place. The news must have been that shocking.

 

In contrast, Lisbell remained calm. For the first time, she realized how easy it was to lie. By simply stripping away her emotions and reciting plausible words that came to mind, it wasn’t that difficult. Above all, she believed this was the best path for Theodore.

 

Now that she had realized this was the best course of action.

 

“You don’t love me…?”

 

His eyes, which had been turbulent, soon regained focus.

 

“Don’t lie.”

 

“It’s not a lie.”

 

“No, it is a lie.”

 



 

“I know you. Have I only known you for a year? As much as you’ve seen me, I’ve seen you too, Lisbell.”

 

Lisbell turned her head to avoid his gaze. Then Theodore got off the sofa and knelt down in front of her, trying to look into her face. She wanted to avoid it, but knowing that avoiding it more would only increase his suspicion, Lisbell remained still as if she were a stone.

 

Theodore scrutinized her small face deeply and closely.

 

“…Why?”

 



 

“Why are you saying such things…?”

 

“They say there are no reasons when love begins.”

 



 

“I think it’s the same when it ends.”

 

Trying to appear as if she had made a difficult decision, Lisbell brushed her face once.

 

“I was confused too, facing this right before the wedding, so I needed some quiet time to think. But seeing you come all the way here… I now have an unshakable certainty. I don’t feel any excitement when I see you anymore.”

 

“Lies.”

 

“It’s not a lie.”

 

“Lies…”

 

His resolute consciousness began to waver.

 

Believing that Lisbell had no reason to hide such things from him, the cruel excuse she presented seemed to validate all her actions.

 

The sudden departure, the rude notification to delay the wedding via phone, and the awkward behavior when they finally met here…

 

“I know this shouldn’t have been avoided in this way. But the time we spent together was precious to me too. That’s why I was scared and afraid of the moment when I would have to tell you this…”

 

Lisbell drove the nail into his collapse.

 



 

Theodore finally looked speechless. The grip on Lisbell’s hand, which he held as if it were a lifeline, had weakened considerably. Lisbell quietly looked down at his hand, which had always felt reassuring. It seemed like she was trying to capture the warmth she would never feel again.

 

“…Then what about your mother?”

 



 

“There must be something wrong with her. I’m sorry, Lisbell, but I can’t help but think that your sudden change is because of her.”

 

“My mother is perfectly fine. Theo, she’s as healthy as ever, your worries were for nothing.”

 

“Then why did you come to Marnia?”

 



 

“You said you needed time to think? But why did it have to be here? Isn’t it because your mother is here? And wasn’t it because something happened to her? If nothing’s wrong with her, then why, why did you pack up and come here all of a sudden? Why here…”

 

His voice had grown slightly harsh. It was a sign that his denial was fading and a faint disappointment that the story might be true was beginning to settle in. Negative emotions always tend to spread quickly. The small bud of pessimism in Theodore would surely follow that trend.

 

“No way…”

 



 

“Then did you come to see that man?”

 

His misunderstanding was clear. Lisbell didn’t respond. She knew it was time to nurture his misunderstanding, not correct it.

 

Saying it wasn’t true would only nullify all the effort she had put into uttering each painful word.

 

She couldn’t say it twice. If she did, she would end up pathetically begging him not to leave her, confessing it was all a lie.

 

So she endured it. Misunderstanding her relationship with Ulrich in that way was excruciatingly painful, but if it was the way to save Theodore, she had to endure it.

 

“No, right?”

 



 

“Say no, Lisbell.”

 



 

“Please, just say no…”

 

The shock and fear that his fiancée might have another man just before their wedding finally broke Theodore down.

 

Lisbell couldn’t bear to look at him resting his face on her knee. Even so, she could tell he was crying. She felt the hem of her skirt getting wet where his face touched it.

 

The traces of tears gathering like puddles in this place, where it didn’t rain, felt like tears he was shedding for her.

 

The simple and kind-hearted Theodore Motier.

 

“I wish you always happiness.”

 

This is sincere…

 

Swallowing back the words she couldn’t bring herself to say, Lisbell looked out the window. Her eyes, reflecting the slightly subdued sunlight, grew as dull as those of a living corpse.

 



 

She didn’t see Theodore off as he left.

 

She just sat silently in the drawing room for as long as it would take for him to leave the villa and go far away.

 

The shadows of the afternoon, now more sharply angled, cast a shape that seemed to cut at her feet. She stared blankly into space as if unable to escape from those shadows.

 

What is this feeling?

 

What is this strangely calm feeling?

 

Even though she wanted to hold onto him and believed she had no hope otherwise, had she been mentally preparing herself for the moment they would part?

 

Oh, is it resignation?

 

Yes, this feeling of a desolate heart with no will left must be resignation. It was a new emotion to her, and though fascinating, it wasn’t welcoming.

 

Lisbell, who had been as silent as a pillar for a long time, finally stood up quietly. Leaving the drawing room, she headed to her mother’s bedroom to return to her routine.

 

Her mother looked exactly the same as before she had left.

 

What would Theodore have done if he had seen her mother like this?

 

He would have hugged her tightly right away.

 

And he would have said something like this:

 

“You’ve been suffering alone, haven’t you?”

 

“Why didn’t you tell me?”

 

“Lisbell, don’t try to bear it all alone.”

 

“I’m here with you.”

 

Just imagining it made it seem like his voice was really there. It was because she had heard those words before. It was the comfort he had given her every time she was struggling, the comfort she trusted and followed.

 

The more she reminisced about him, the more she felt she had made the right decision.

 

While sitting silently in the drawing room, Lisbell had envisioned the future with Theodore as if recalling an unfulfilled dream.

 

The imagination started from the point where she told him the truth.

 

Theodore would probably have run around tirelessly to solve the financial problems, just as he had said. She might have helped him, and the problem could have been resolved more smoothly than expected.

 

The real problem would come afterward.

 

Ulrich, who found her amusing to play with, would use the farm contract as leverage to threaten Theodore’s family. That would bring chaos far beyond the current financial issues. It was about the survival of the factory that his father had built.

 

After resolving that, Ulrich would directly pull the invisible leash he had placed around her neck. He would force her to confess that she had betrayed Theodore and was humiliated under Ulrich.

 

Ironically, the scariest part of her imagination was here.

 

Lisbell’s fear lay there.

 

External pressures and threats could be overcome together. But if distrust was sown from within, breaking their trust and faith in each other, the end would be unpredictable.

 

If that truth was exposed and Theodore abandoned her because of it, she wouldn’t be able to bear it. That fear and horror drove her to let him go first. It was cowardly avoidance, but still, but still…

 

Lisbell imagined the end with him breaking multiple times. Repeating it until Theodore left the villa, she endured it in the same place.

 

If she hadn’t done that, she would have chased after him, telling him not to cry and caressing his cheek.


Lisbell sat down in the chair and opened a book.

 

She calmly resumed reading from where she left off. Her voice flowed smoothly through the first and second lines but faltered on the third. The quiet sound was swallowed by the stillness of the bedroom.

 

After a brief silence, Lisbell started reading again from that part. Yet again, she stumbled. Trying to pretend nothing was wrong, she resumed speaking but soon faltered again.

 



 

Taking her eyes off the book, she looked at her mother’s hand, neatly placed on the blanket. She closed the book, set it down, and stood up to grasp it. Even though she knew it was too frail for her to hold, she couldn’t endure without doing so.

 

“Mother.”

 

No answer came back.

 

She felt disappointed despite not expecting a response.

 

“Did I make the right decision?”

 

It didn’t matter if it wasn’t her mother. She wanted to hear an answer from anyone.

 

“Please, tell me I did.”

 

That I didn’t make the wrong decision.

 

“Please….”

 

Tell me that this regret I’m feeling now is misplaced.

 

Holding her mother’s hand, she sank to the floor and lowered her head. The tears she had held back in front of Theodore now streamed down uncontrollably.

 

Regret always came too late, hitting her with an overwhelming force. Lisbell couldn’t resist it and was buried in it.

 

After crying until her knees on the floor were damp, dizziness washed over her. She leaned her dizzy head against the bed and then slowly stood up.

 

She didn’t want to show such a miserable sight by her mother’s side, not knowing when she might wake up. If her mother, encouraged by her hope, were to wake and see her daughter’s face like this, it would break her heart.

 

Rationalizing that she needed to take a break from caregiving for the day, Lisbell tidied up.

 

In that short time, her swollen eyelids stung every time she blinked. This made her think of Theodore. He must have cried just as much. No, probably even more. His eyes must have stung terribly…. Lisbell bit her lip at the thought that made her heart ache.

 

Today, she wanted to hide in a corner where no one could see her. She wanted to lie in bed, pull the blanket over her head, and sleep as if tomorrow would never come. With such gloomy thoughts, she left the bedroom.

 

She was heading down the hallway to her room when a slightly open bedroom door caught her attention. What drew her attention was not the now familiar interior design or the overwhelming furnishings.

 



 

There was a drink table, as always. A sleek liquor bottle was on it. The type of liquor often changed, apparently according to Ulrich’s taste, but what she saw now was the same one Ulrich had drunk a few days ago.

 

The reason Lisbell noticed it, despite her preoccupied mind, was simple. She remembered the strange exhilaration from that day, when just one glass made her feel as if her brain was relaxing and her body melting away. The taste was awful, but the effect was remarkable.

 

What she needed now was not something else but that effect to escape this oppressive regret.

 

When the thought crossed her mind, her feet had already crossed the bedroom threshold.

 



 

“All duds, as expected.”

 

Ulrich took off his leather gloves, disliking the strong smell of gunpowder, and made a dissatisfied face. Victor, who had been standing a bit further away, approached with an expected look and nodded.

 

While Victor tidied up the firearms, Ulrich turned his head and gazed into the distance, seemingly looking at a specific place at the villa entrance, although it was unclear exactly where.

 

Victor signaled the household staff, who had come out to wait, to tidy up and quickly followed Ulrich.

 

“I’ve sent out the invitations as per the list you provided last time. Once the trial operation is over, we plan to hold the opening ceremony. We’ll prepare the reception party in three parts, similar to the opening of Hotel No. 1.”

 

“Yes, do that.”

 

“I’ve also drafted a speech, but it would be good for you to review it. After all, you’ll be delivering it.”

 

Ulrich’s shoulders slightly rose and fell as he walked ahead. Though Victor could only see his back, he could vividly imagine the sigh on Ulrich’s face.

 

“So, the day has finally come to go to the capital.”

 

“Please endure it for just a few days.”

 

“Just make sure neither Mother nor Gwen gets anywhere near me.”

 

How can they not come, given it’s a family-run business….

 

The thought was obvious, but Victor kept it to himself, knowing Ulrich would loathe it. Getting Ulrich to the capital hotel for the opening ceremony was essential from his standpoint.

 

Having finished all the business matters, it was now time to address personal concerns. Victor put down the notebook he had been holding.

 

“Just to be cautious… have you been taking your medicine, sir?”

 

“Medicine?”

 

“Or administering it.”

 

Ulrich, walking ahead, paused momentarily before realizing Victor’s intent and let out a short laugh.

 

“Neither.”

 

The assistant was referring to the measures to prevent a child from being conceived through his affairs with Lisbell. Ulrich thought Victor was exceptionally meticulous. It was indeed a fundamental part of the education for anyone stepping into this family business.

 

“I don’t finish inside anyway.”

 

It was quite uncomfortable having to listen to such personal matters, but thanks to past experience, Victor had developed the resilience not to flinch.

 

“One can never be too careful.”

 

“Indeed.”

 

“It’s an issue that can’t be taken too lightly.”

 

Absolutely.

 

In high society, where bloodline succession was crucial, the issue of heirs was always a hot topic. It could be a result of tender love or a product of terrible infidelity. Such stories would fuel the scandals that would brighten up Laurent’s social season more than spring flowers.

 

This issue’s magnitude was even greater in larger, more prestigious families. The Altahart family, with their historically poor sense of propriety, had faced this problem numerous times.

 

Blood could be a powerful bond, a weapon, and a form of power in the face of a prestigious name.

 

According to the ancestors’ rule that only those bearing the family blood could inherit the name and the business rights, a wrongly conceived child could potentially consume the entire family.

 

Therefore, Ulrich did not welcome the idea of children.

 

He didn’t want to bear the risk of producing a child just for a night’s pleasure. He didn’t want to create a life from a brief moment of sweetness if it meant bearing that much risk and responsibility.

 

Victor had developed a tolerance for Ulrich’s personal life because he had handled such matters many times. When Ulrich had a regular female companion, Victor would ensure she took contraceptives, and if she seemed particularly untrustworthy, he would recommend Ulrich to take them. They both agreed that a child shouldn’t be conceived carelessly, and Ulrich never resisted taking the medication.

 

“By the way, is that kid still at the main house?”

 

Victor nodded, understanding who Ulrich meant.

 

“Yes, he is.”

 

“How’s he doing?”

 

“Well….”

 

Even a polite response of “well” didn’t come easily. Ulrich, expecting this, let out a resigned chuckle.

 

“Gwen Altahart, of course.”

 



 

“Taking in an illegitimate child and then getting involved with another one… utterly irresponsible.”

 

Victor had some bad news about Gwen. However, it was a sensitive issue that the family was strictly controlling, so even he had to be cautious. Ulrich would find out when he went to the capital anyway.

 

There was no need to bring forward something that would soon cause a headache. Victor decided to keep quiet.

 

“Well, luck might have prevented a child so far, but there’s no guarantee for the future.”

 



 

“From now on, mix the medicine into Lisbell’s meals.”

 

I don’t want a child.

 

That was the implication in his brief order.


“More importantly, the guest?” 

 

Ulrich casually asked as he opened the door to the office they had arrived at. Victor followed behind and closed the door. He glanced towards the office window.

 

“He has left.”

 

“And the send-off?”

 

“As per your instructions, I had a driver ready to take him to the station, but he declined and left the villa alone. The driver said he looked like he was about to cry.”

 

Ulrich, who was about to light a cigarette as he sat down, paused in thought and then quietly laughed.

 

“What is Lisbell doing?”

 

“I heard she is in the drawing room.”

 

“Still?”

 

“Yes.”

 

His smile deepened.

 

“One side is propping up a pitiful pride, while the other is just sitting there without even seeing him off…”

 

Just by their attitudes, the situation was clear. Ulrich, humming contentedly, shuffled through the papers. Victor, watching him, quietly clicked his tongue. He recalled some of the absurd instructions he had silently followed as Ulrich’s secretary.

 

Bribing the Marnia police to send letters about a non-existent incident, investigating an unrelated factory owner in another city, or suddenly driving off to Misley in the east and then returning…

 

He now knew well that a woman was at the end of all those paths.

 

Lisbell Osborne.

 

The daughter of Mrs. Osborne, who once managed this villa, and now, essentially Ulrich’s mistress. He didn’t know when it started, but she had firmly caught Ulrich Altahart’s interest.

 

No matter how many times he thought about it, it was pitiful. How did she catch this madman’s attention? What strange thing had she done?

 

Then his thoughts shifted.

 

No.

 

She might not have done anything peculiar. One must not overlook the fact that this boss was crazy. Madmen are unpredictable because they get hooked on strange points. If he had been capable of rational thought, he would have long been repulsed by the Altahart name and left it.

 

Ulrich seemed to consider himself one of the more normal members of his family, but Victor saw it differently. Based on the obstinacy and persistence he showed in incidents, he was the most extreme among his family.

 

Knowing when to give up was also a skill. But Ulrich couldn’t accept that.

 

He was the type to keep going until he succeeded. He would use everything he had to achieve his goal, even if it meant breaking someone’s spirit. And he felt no guilt about it.

 

That was the essence and dark side of Altahart that no one could deny. Ulrich too, despite his noble name, hid a vile nature underneath.

 

“Then I’ll adjust the schedule to match the hotel opening date. Since you’ll be in the capital, I’ll arrange for you to handle all matters requiring your attention at once.”

 

“Don’t report to the mansion yet.”

 

Despite his hatred for other Altaharts, Victor silently bowed.

 

After his secretary left, Ulrich worked for a while. After reviewing and clearing the piled-up documents, he found that night had fallen. He looked at the darkening sky, then stood up quietly.

 

“I heard she is in the drawing room.”

 

Is she still there?

 

He headed towards the drawing room. The sound of his footsteps echoed in the wide, silent hallway. The night breeze, passing through the occasionally open windows, felt pleasant.

 

“The driver said he looked like he was about to cry.”

 

Ulrich’s smile deepened. He brushed his hair back in the soft breeze. He felt a thrill from the idea that Lisbell and he had shared a thought at that moment.

 

He soon reached the drawing room and opened the door. It was quiet inside. After confirming no one was there, he was about to leave.

 

But something caught his eye.

 



 

Ulrich approached the sofa. A piece of black cloth stuck out. It was a necktie, thrown carelessly. He was the only one in this villa who owned something like that.

 

He quickly deduced its origin. It was likely the tie he had used to tie her hair when she went to meet her fiancé.

 

If it’s here…

 

“Ha.”

 

So, she wasn’t just being prideful.

 

Ulrich picked up the tie, which seemed about to fall off the sofa. A gray hair was tangled at the end, as if it had been forcefully pulled out.

 

He stared at the thin strand.

 

He remembered the taste of her tears he had once licked. He wondered if it would taste the same here, but he didn’t bring it to his lips. If he were to taste it, he’d prefer it fresh from her rather than this discarded state.

 

After staring at the hair for a while, he let it float away lightly and left the drawing room with the tie in hand.

 

He quickly guessed where she might be. Even in such an infuriating situation, she wouldn’t abandon her duty to stay by her mother’s side. Her actions were always predictable.

 

What amazed him was himself.

 

Despite hating boredom, he didn’t find this predictable process tedious.

 

He didn’t know if this change was good or bad, but it wasn’t unpleasant. Ulrich hummed softly as he crossed the corridor.

 

The sky had turned a clean, dark black.

 

Under the particularly dark night sky, Ulrich reached the bedroom he had visited earlier that morning.

 

Knock, knock.

 

Knowing no one would answer, he opened the door immediately. It was quiet inside. But he couldn’t conclude she wasn’t there. Lisbell always sat like a wax doll, barely noticeable.

 



 

So he believed he would see her sitting quietly.

 

…She’s not here?

 

The room was empty.

 

Only the cold, dying figure on the bed was there. It was so unexpected that Ulrich looked around, still holding the doorknob.

 

But no matter how much he looked, he couldn’t find her.

 

Strangely, an unseen tension suddenly gripped his mind.

 

Even realizing she wasn’t there, he stepped into the bedroom. It was close to a malfunction, his assumption shattering.

 

Ulrich approached the bed, moving his tongue slowly. Mrs. Osborne slept like the dead, with the same face as yesterday and the day before.

 

Ulrich, arms crossed, leaned and looked down at her static face.

 

Then his gaze shifted.

 

Wind blew in through a slightly open window. The dark air felt thick under the sky that would soon hold the Milky Way.

 

Ulrich straightened up slowly.

 

The wind, once refreshing, now felt stifling. This was because an unthinkable assumption had emerged.

 

Did she leave her mother behind?

 

With her overly kind nature?

 

Impossible.

 

Even as he thought that, Ulrich quickly left the bedroom.

 

Given the driver’s report of Theodore looking like he was about to cry, and Lisbell’s refusal to see him off, it was clear. Today, Lisbell must have broken off the engagement. All signs pointed to it. It must have been a seismic shift in her life.

 

What if, in such a state, she momentarily lost her mind and decided to abandon her mother to escape?

 

Even thinking it unlikely, Ulrich’s steps quickened as he headed to her bedroom.


Still walking gracefully, it was a posture that anyone who knew him well would notice the distinct difference in an instant. Ulrich arrived at Lisbell’s bedroom without taking a single breath.

 

This time, he skipped knocking and abruptly flung the door open.

 

The interior was dim, barely recognizable. The curtains, which might have been drawn since the previous night or earlier, had not been pulled back, making the room feel eerily cold and silent.

 

Ulrich’s eyebrows twitched slightly.

 

In the desolate atmosphere, there was a faint smell of alcohol.

 

Ulrich quietly walked toward the bed. The first thing he saw was her disheveled hand. Then, he saw her back as she lay on her knees on the floor, leaning against the bed, asleep. Next to her feet lay a bottle of whiskey.

 

It was the whiskey he recently enjoyed.

 

Now he understood why she had been absent from the spot she usually occupied daily to take care of him.

 

Ulrich nudged the empty bottle with the toe of his shoe and looked down. Her sleeping posture, sprawled out without moving, was quite a sight.

 

He lifted his head slightly.

 

Even though it was his first time in Lisbell’s bedroom today, it unmistakably felt like her space despite being under his ownership. Slightly cluttered items and signs of use were noticeable.

 

The live-in staff diligently cleaned and maintained the villa daily, including his bedroom. It was the same kind of work that Mrs. Osborne did before she collapsed.

 

But Ulrich had instructed them not to touch this room. He didn’t want anyone else’s gaze or hands intruding on Lisbell’s domain. More precisely, he wanted to be the only one to touch it. He wanted to enjoy her pure essence untouched by anyone else.

 

And this space was the very presence of the living Lisbell.

 

Ulrich didn’t find the seemingly messy interior particularly unpleasant and bent his knees to sit.

 

“…Ah, it’s wrinkled.”

 

Holding it in his hand all the way here had crumpled his tie.

 

As he looked at it, he firmly grabbed Lisbell’s hair as she slept, lying face down. He didn’t hold back, and as he pulled, she let out a small groan, “Ugh…”

 

Daring to loosen it without permission.

 

Ulrich stroked her fine hair that slipped through his fingers. He never thought a day would come when he’d be so concerned with someone’s hair. The thin strands seemed like they could tear at any moment, but surprisingly, they were tough. It reminded him of her persistence.

 

Nonetheless, Lisbell’s gray hair clung to his fingers without tearing, feeling like a very thin whip. The more he toyed with it, the stranger he felt. Touching it with one hand, he realized the sensation was enough to bring him to climax if he pulled out his cock from his pants with the other.

 

He hadn’t planned on it, but once he became conscious of it, blood rushed to his lower body, swelling it tightly. Just as he wondered if he should go through with it, Lisbell turned her head, murmuring, 

 

“Mmm…”

 

Her thin hair slid smoothly through his fingers.

 

Ulrich stared at his empty hand momentarily before slowly loosening his tie. He slipped it over Lisbell’s head and placed his arm under her bent knees.

 

When he lifted her onto the bed, she tilted her head back, her moist lips slightly parting. Ulrich brought his face close to hers. The strong scent of alcohol in her breath was evident. The whiskey bottle, nearly empty, provided proof of where it had all gone.

 

Kneeling on one knee on the bed, Ulrich tightened the tie he had placed around her neck. As the space gradually closed, it soon fit snugly around her neck.

 

“…Cough.”

 

The tie tightened like a cord around her neck, causing Lisbell to instinctively gasp for breath, curling her fingers. Ulrich watched her struggle indifferently before gradually releasing his grip.

 

As he pulled the tie knot in the opposite direction, a faint mark appeared on her neck. The vague discomfort he felt on his way here dissipated somewhat.

 

Switching his gaze between his still-swollen groin and Lisbell’s pale face, Ulrich straightened up.

 

He hesitated briefly, remembering that he didn’t particularly enjoy the feeling of holding a drunken woman and having sex as if he were the only one indulging in lewdness.

 

His hand, which had been brushing against the tie’s wide end, was about to retreat into the air.

 

“Mm…”

 

Then, Lisbell trembled and opened her eyes, which had been closed all this time.

 

Her pale purple eyes, slightly clouded with tears, searched the void meaninglessly before slowly focusing on the man occupying part of her vision. Ulrich reached out to close her eyes, which were clearly drunk.

 

“…Theo?”

 

But unexpectedly, his arm was grabbed.

 

Lisbell, with a voice that sounded like she had cried a lot, called out.

 

“Theo, is that you?”

 

Her pronunciation was more slurred than usual. Ulrich easily allowed himself to be pulled closer by the hand gripping his arm.

 

To be precise, it was the first time Lisbell had held onto him like this, so he was slightly bewildered and let himself be pulled.

 

“Don’t go.”

 



 

“Don’t go, Theo…”

 

Clinging to his arm with desperate hope, Lisbell mumbled, rubbing her face against it. Witnessing this, Ulrich quickly concluded.

 

She’s drunk.

 

Indeed, having drunk such a strong liquor on an empty stomach, it was impossible to avoid getting thoroughly drunk.

 

Nevertheless, seeing Lisbell, who usually stayed calm and barely smiled in front of him, clinging like this was quite novel. So, Ulrich remained still, allowing her to pull him further until he was practically lying on top of her.

 



 

Ulrich’s eyes gleamed softly in the darkness.

 

Even her lips, which occasionally pressed against his, carried the remnants of the intoxication lingering in the room. As he remained motionless, Lisbell, seeming to take his stillness as a sign, lifted her head and pressed her lips more firmly against his.

 

“Mm…”

 

The soft moan leaking between her slightly parted lips was different from what he usually heard from her, more sensual. He found it amusing and slightly smiled, causing Lisbell to think he had given her permission and to gently suck on his slightly parted lips.

 

Ulrich maintained his half-bent posture, supporting himself with one hand on the bed. His dark gray eyes, gleaming in the darkness, were unusually calm for a man engaged in a kiss.

 

Mistaking him for her fiancé, whom she had tearfully sent away earlier, Lisbell kissed him, believing it was Theodore.

 

“Did you always kiss like this?”

 

He criticized the lukewarm kiss, with her timidly sucking on the surface of his lips. Every time he thrust his tongue deep into her mouth, she trembled like a rabbit caught by the tail, and now he understood why. If this was how she kissed her fiancé, it made sense.

 

“Even a child would do better than this.”

 



 

“I wonder if you even had a proper first night.”

 

His low voice murmured ambiguously, making Lisbell, thinking he was interrupting her kiss, let out a soft “Mm…?” with a drawn-out moan.

 

Ulrich gently pressed her slender chin with his fingers.

 

Even in a room where it was difficult to find a single ray of light, the soft movement of her lips was visible and felt smooth. Whenever he approached her, it always felt like she reluctantly complied, but if this was how she kissed her fiancé, it made sense.

 

Ulrich smirked but felt a strange chill in the back of his mind.

 

He released her chin and lowered his head again to kiss her. This time, Lisbell, though hesitant, gradually wrapped her arms around his neck.

 

The seductive behavior, like the scent of strong flowers in spring, made Ulrich feel uncomfortable below.

 

Despite the overpowering scent of intoxication from her, there was something tantalizing about it. It was as if she knew how to stir a man’s desires with her charm.
