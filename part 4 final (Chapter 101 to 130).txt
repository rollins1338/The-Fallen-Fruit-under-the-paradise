Chapter 101

From afar, the sound of water running could be heard.

 

Lisbell, sprawled carelessly on the bed, habitually glanced towards the window.

 

She saw clouds floating lazily in the distance. Though she had thought they would all be of different shapes, they surprisingly looked quite similar. Or perhaps she had been staring vacantly at the sky for so long in recent days that she could no longer distinguish them.

 

How many days had passed?

 

She squinted, trying to dig deep into her consciousness, but no clear answer emerged. The monotonous days had dragged on so long that even the sky’s scenery had become indifferent. She had no energy left to count the days one by one.

 

Would anything have been different before?

 

Would she have strained, gnashing her teeth, hoping to escape this bedroom, struggling with shackles that showed no sign of loosening, no matter how much she tugged or shook them?

 

Perhaps.

 

But not now.

 

Ever since those words pierced deeply into her heart, breaking her will like straw in the wind, she had been like this.

 

“Accept the situation.”

 

“The more you resist and struggle, the more curious I get to see how far you can go.”

 

The thought that everything she did might become new prey for him soaked her mind in dullness time and again. A few words, hardly enough to be worth a handful, made her thoughts go blank. It was as if the gears of her consciousness had rusted and stopped in a bizarre form.

 

All Lisbell could see were the fluffy clouds in the sky, so clear and pure that they made her current situation seem even more bleak.

 

Hope shattered before she could grasp it, and despair rushed in faster, swallowing her whole. Lisbell found herself in this bedroom, as if she were nothing more than a wax doll, stripped of all sense of time and space that she was supposed to enjoy as a human being.

 

Ah.

 

A faint groan formed on her tongue and then crumbled away weakly.

 

No matter how monotonous the days, she had never spent so much time staring at the sky, observing the shapes of the clouds.

 

Back then, there was no reason to wonder about the shape of the sky, the air outside, or the trends of the outside world. Those were things she could confirm with her own two feet if she just stepped outside.

 

Ah….

 

Just like her lost freedom, her mind was too busy drooping, without anything to hold it up. There had been a time when she had been excited to see the clear sky after heavy rain, but now even such feelings had faded.

 

Everything was just too much.

 

Had sunlight always been this blinding?

 

Was it always this… dazzling and splendid?

 

Was this really the state, the appearance I knew?

 

Why does this truth feel so overwhelming?

 

Why….

 

The weight of reality, which had once seemed insignificant, now closed in, tightening around her like a noose, bringing a painful realization that spread through her like a heartbeat.

 

When did it start?

 

When did I stop looking forward to tomorrow….

 

Was it from the time in his little paradise, Marnia, or when life in this capital, his true cradle, began?

 

Lisbell slowly lowered her eyelids as if she would never open them again. She let the faint sound of water trickle into her hazy thoughts.

 

A burning sensation settled on her dry cheeks, which had dried from much crying.

 

Just as she was trying to swallow her breath, hoping to remain unseen like a dead person, she heard the sound of the door gently opening.

 

Come to think of it, Ulrich had just gone to take a shower after suggesting they have a meal together before he left the bed. She thought he would call for the servant after coming out of the bathroom, but perhaps he had already summoned them.

 

She was acting as if whatever happened in this bedroom was thoroughly irrelevant to her.

 

The presence that entered the bedroom was extremely cautious. Tap, tap, tap. The small footsteps sounded so light that it seemed like it would be tiring to walk that way. Lisbell recalled the servants she had encountered while staying here. Reflecting on their attitude of treating her like a ghost they shouldn’t get entangled with, she understood why they acted like that.

 

She just didn’t want to think about anything. She wanted to pull the blanket over her head. But soon, even that seemed too bothersome.

 

The footsteps drew closer. The person must have deliberately circled around the bed to reach the dining table. There was no smell of food. That was a relief. The scent of food in here would have only triggered nausea that pounded at her insides.

 

Eventually, the footsteps stopped. At that moment, Lisbell became aware of a faint presence over her body. It was so strange that her eyelids, which had been drooping without energy, twitched.

 

“Lis…”

 

The voice, as small and delicate as the footsteps, was immature.

 

Lisbell was startled when she felt a hand stroking her cheek. She hastily opened her eyes wide and saw a child, barely half her size, in front of her. She almost let out a scream but managed to stifle it.

 

“Noah, why are you here…?”

 

Her reaction was so astonished that Noah’s eyes widened in surprise as well. Lisbell felt the child’s gaze move to her neck, so she hurriedly pulled up the blanket. But it only covered up to her chest.

 

“Why, why did you come here?”

 

“Lis…”

 

The moment Noah saw the face of the kind person who had taken care of him for the past few days, he seemed to relax, and tears welled up in his eyes, rendering him speechless.

 

Lisbell extended her arms and embraced the child. Noah snuggled into her embrace, rubbing his face against her. She couldn’t believe the sensation of the child’s fine hair spreading under her fingers.

 

How long had it been since she had seen someone other than Ulrich in this bedroom?

 

The servants often finished their tasks without even meeting her gaze, as if she were a living piece of furniture, and the Altahart lady, whom she had so eagerly hoped for, had also left the room without taking any action, making it difficult to see her again.

 

Lisbell clutched the warmth in her arms tightly, as if it were her only lifeline.

 

“Did you… did you come to see me?”

 

Lisbell asked, lifting the collapsing child.

 

“Uh-huh…”

 

Noah, whose vision was blurred with moisture, wiped his eyes with the back of his small hand. Lisbell grabbed the child’s hand and gently wiped his eyes for him.

 

Noah, with his beautiful eyelashes fluttering, leaned against Lisbell’s chest.

 

The weight of the child leaning on her tugged at something deep in her core. A hot, swelling sensation spread within her, like warm water pooling and heating her up. Lisbell pressed her face against the child’s crown and let out a fragile sigh.

 

A day from the past flashed through her mind.

 

It was the day she had discovered the truth about her mother’s situation, and Ulrich had shed the mask he had been wearing. It was the day Julian Scott, who had played a part in that situation, was brutally crushed like a piece of meat beneath Ulrich’s foot.

 

Clang—

 

Memories she had buried away were unearthed, and a dreadful scene of a flower vase, shining in the moonlight, smashing against someone’s head was revived. After that incident, Ulrich had dragged her into this bedroom, and Lisbell had spotted Noah hiding in a corner.

 

Unable to explain anything to the child at that time, she had been locked in this bedroom, so he must have been so anxious.

 

Just as her own heart had been pounding with fear, the child must have also harbored a small drum deep in his belly, beating against his mind and body.

 

Lisbell stroked the small body with a sense of apology.

 

But that sense of security didn’t last long.

 

In the distance, the sound of water in the bathroom abruptly stopped. The ensuing silence struck her like a whip. Lisbell forced the child clinging to her away.

 

“Noah, you have to go quickly.”

 

As if mirroring her emotions, the child also showed a pale, frightened expression.

 

She desperately wanted to comfort him, but there was no time for that. Considering the violence and cruelty Ulrich had shown towards her, she couldn’t predict what punishment he might impose on Noah for sneaking into the bedroom.

 

Ulrich had now become such a terrifying figure to her that she didn’t want to expose such a fragile, delicate child to his sight.

 

“Hurry, quickly….”

 

Squeak.

 

She could hear him taking down the robe from the rack. There really was no time left.

 

But Noah didn’t follow her instructions. He shook his head, his face puffed up, unwilling to leave the warmth of Lisbell’s arms. “Lis, Lis…” he whimpered, clutching the blanket desperately.

 

Footsteps could be heard. The sound of approaching steps pierced her eardrums, getting closer and closer.


Lisbell could no longer stay still. She got up from the bed while holding Noah.

 

The combination of the aftereffects of their affair and having properly regained her sight after several days caused a bout of dizziness. The time spent staggering was too precious to waste. Gritting her teeth, Lisbell made her way toward the makeshift wardrobe.

 

“Don’t come out until I say so. And don’t make any noise until then. No matter what you hear outside, don’t come out. Understand?”

 

“Why…? Why?”

 

“Because I don’t know what might happen to you. Noah, please.”

 

Despite knowing it would make the child anxious, she closed the wardrobe door. As she extended her arm, the shackles’ chains tightened, preventing her from moving further. It was a relief that she could at least reach the wardrobe.

 

Lisbell returned to the bed with cautious steps. She positioned herself in a spot similar to where she had been before getting up. Just as she was pulling the blanket over herself, the tightly shut bathroom door opened.

 

She felt his gaze land on her back as she curled up. The sound of footsteps approaching the bed grew louder.

 

“Are you asleep?”

 

Her ankle, nestled between the blanket and the sheet, was suddenly grabbed. Her body, unable to resist, was pulled along. Lisbell’s limbs twisted in shock, already tense from the situation.

 

What a nasty man. Even if she had been asleep, this rough handling would have surely woken her, yet his actions showed no hesitation. It was proof that he was doing this on purpose.

 

Ulrich chuckled softly as he laid her down in front of him. He held a towel dampened with water in his hand.

 

“Stay still while I clean you.”

 

In truth, she more often fainted after their affairs than remained conscious like this. Whenever she regained consciousness after such incidents, her body was clean, leading her to believe that he washed her while she was unconscious. On days when she tried to stay awake, he would force her to take sleeping pills.

 

Lisbell stared at the ceiling, feeling completely deprived of free will. Yet, her nerves stood on end. Her focus was drawn to a single spot in the bedroom.

 

Her tongue twisted silently as she tried not to let her gaze wander toward the wardrobe.

 

“…I’m hungry.”

 

Ulrich paused as he wiped away the dried traces of semen from her inner thigh. His pale gray eyes shimmered like waves stirred by the wind.

 

His sudden lack of reaction made her glance up at him. Ulrich smiled with narrowed eyes.

 

“Oh, sorry. I wasn’t expecting that.”

 



 

“I thought your dream was to starve yourself.”

 

His tone was undoubtedly mocking her habit of skipping meals. In the past, she would have weakly pushed away his touch and stared blankly at the ceiling.

 

But now, she couldn’t afford to let her mind drift. Even that would be a luxury. In this wretched bedroom, there was a small, delicate life that she had to protect.

 

“Is it not your dream?”

 

“It would be too sad to say that.”

 



 

“I’m always worried about feeding you more.”

 

He spoke with a silver tongue. Lisbell turned her head away, not wanting to see his face. Ulrich bit her cheek playfully and then reached for the call button.

 

Seeing this, Lisbell hurriedly spoke up.

 

“You should go get it yourself.”

 

She needed time to get Noah out of the wardrobe and out of the bedroom. To do that, she first had to separate Ulrich from this space. The meal was just an excuse.

 

She had no appetite and wouldn’t eat, but she could keep asking him for food and conversation if it meant getting Noah out of there.

 

Ulrich’s eyebrows furrowed in mild displeasure, yet there was a clear curiosity in his expression. Lisbell felt her heart tighten as she silently swallowed her saliva and pulled the blanket closer.

 

“I don’t want anyone entering this bedroom.”

 

“Now you say that?”

 

“I didn’t want it from the beginning, but you never asked me and called the servants.”

 

Ulrich blinked. His perfectly shaped eyes seemed lost in thought, making her throat constrict bitterly.

 

He chuckled softly and gathered her tangled hair in his hand. As he bent down to press a kiss to the ends, his manner was reminiscent of the noble etiquette one might see at a banquet. Of course, given that this was a bedroom where the heat of their intimacy hadn’t fully dissipated, it was clear that his actions were just a mockery.

 

“Yes, my princess.”

 



 

“As you wish.”

 

The title, so unfitting for her situation, sent shivers down her spine.

 

With a smirk, Ulrich lifted his upper body. Lisbell remained motionless, waiting for him to leave the bedroom. Fortunately, there was no sign of movement from the closed wardrobe. Noah was following her instructions, much to her relief.

 

Ulrich grabbed a robe hanging on the side and headed toward the door. His long strides echoed in Lisbell’s ears. Or rather, it was her heartbeat. Her pulse pounded in her chest as if her heart might leap out.

 

Finally, Ulrich reached for the gold-painted doorknob.

 

All he needed to do was lower it, pull, and walk out.

 

But he stopped dead in his tracks. Ulrich, frozen as if he had turned to a pillar of salt, slowly turned his head. His sharp profile revealed as he glanced toward the bed. Then, unexpectedly,

 

“Shh.”

 

He brought his long index finger to his lips.

 

Lisbell, already tense, shrank further into herself. Ulrich’s normally mild eyes gleamed sharply, like a well-honed blade.

 

He suddenly turned and strode in a large arc.

 

Realizing his destination was the wardrobe, Lisbell hurriedly pushed herself up.

 

Ulrich moved with such purpose that he seemed oblivious to any sounds. Lisbell, realizing that he had somehow detected the foreign presence in the bedroom, crawled across the bed in a desperate attempt to reach him.

 

“Wa-wait…!”

 

But he was faster than her.

 

The tightly closed wardrobe door opened with a thud. By then, Lisbell, who had hastily climbed off the bed, tripped and fell to the floor.

 

Caught in the wardrobe, Noah was covering his mouth with both hands. His glassy eyes grew wide with fear as they darted toward Ulrich, and he began to well up with tears.

 

“…Hmm?”

 

Ulrich let out a puzzled sound upon seeing the unexpected figure. Shortly after, he brushed back his platinum hair with a helpless laugh.

 

He reached out and picked up Noah. Though they were blood relatives, Noah struggled and pushed his uncle away, overwhelmed by fear.

 

Ulrich handed the child over to Lisbell, unable to hide his bemusement. Relieved that he had handed Noah over without a fuss, Lisbell carried the boy to the bed. It was purely an attempt to put some distance between her and Ulrich. Of course, Ulrich was too bewildered to notice.

 

“Why is he here?”

 

“…He came to see me.”

 

Lisbell answered briefly, trying to soothe Noah, who burst into tears as soon as he was back in her arms. The little fists clinging to her wrist told her how frightened he must have been in that wardrobe.

 

Ulrich, watching his blood relative cling to a woman with whom he shared no blood, let out a knowing sigh.

 

His gaze quickly shifted back to Lisbell.

 

“So, you wanted to get rid of me, huh?”

 



 

“I was wondering why you were suddenly acting so out of character.”

 

He laughed softly and leaned closer. Lisbell tensed as she felt his lips brush against her ear.

 

“I didn’t realize it before, but Lisbell, you’re a terrible actress.”

 



 

“You’ll never make it as an actress.”


He couldn’t tell if the words were meant as ridicule or advice, but he quickly corrected his posture before turning his back.

 

“Well, fine. I was wondering who it could be. It’s hard to make an issue out of a child intruding into a bedroom. We’ll end it by reprimanding the person in charge. I’ll call for the nanny now…”

 

“Wait a moment!”

 

At the mention of calling someone, Noah trembled violently as if having a seizure and burrowed into Lisbell’s arms. Lisbell hugged the child with one arm and urgently spoke.

 

“Can’t you wait until Noah falls asleep… and then take him?”

 

“Noah?”

 

“…It’s the child’s name. I gave it to him.”

 

Lisbell hesitated for a moment, feeling regret, before replying quietly. Ulrich clicked his tongue, clearly displeased. But Lisbell, determined to protect Noah at this moment, held the child tightly.

 

“No one in this household even gave him a name.”

 



 

“For a short while, I am in a position where I have the right to teach this child. From that position, I gave him a name to facilitate smooth lessons.”

 

It wasn’t meant to make him feel guilty, but simply to state the facts about Altahart’s coldness. Nor did she expect him to feel anything about it.

 

However, as expected, Ulrich’s unflinching attitude left Lisbell feeling as if something within her was breaking apart. Whenever she glimpsed the eradicated humanity in the man, she felt the blow herself, ironically enough.

 

“Noah is trembling so much. Sending him away like this won’t help, as no one in this house will comfort him. So… please, Ulrich. Just for a moment.”

 

A pitiful sob echoed against her chest. Lisbell hugged Noah more warmly and held her breath.

 

She honestly didn’t expect anything. Sometimes he acted like a monster who fed on her despair. So, even though she knew showing vulnerability like this wouldn’t do any good…

 

She couldn’t abandon the warmth in her arms.

 

Why did she keep getting shocked and disappointed by Ulrich’s relentless coldness? Because something like that still remained within her. Like a small orange flame that could only be ignited by a single match…

 

She thought it had long since extinguished, leaving only gray smoke, but apparently not. And the more she desperately encountered him, the less she could let go of Noah.

 

A low sigh was heard. She mustered the courage to look up. Ulrich, arms crossed, was leaning against the table, staring at her. Despite repeatedly deciding to let go of all expectations, a slight hope rose like the morning sun upon seeing his stance.

 

“Fine.”

 



 

“Once he falls asleep, I’ll call for the nanny.”

 

The words were so unexpected that her mouth almost dropped open. But that didn’t last long, as she was soon busy tending to Noah, who was clinging to her and whimpering.

 

The time spent soothing Noah left Lisbell feeling oddly anxious. Ulrich was watching her closely as she comforted the child. She was also anxious, fearing that his cruel nature might lead him to suddenly change his mind and take Noah away.

 

But Ulrich did not do so.

 

He clearly didn’t seem pleased, but he quietly stayed in place. Every time she checked to see if his interest had waned, his steely blue eyes were relentlessly fixed on her, almost obsessively.

 

His gaze was so intense that it felt like more than just watching, as if he were observing with some specific purpose, which sent chills down her spine.

 

Lisbell was now terrified to the point of death of trying to uncover what lay beneath that gaze and did her best to avoid it.

 



 

Noah’s visits didn’t stop after just one.

 

That day, after falling asleep in Lisbell’s arms and being moved to his bedroom, Noah persistently visited Ulrich’s bedroom thereafter. It would have been right to tell him not to come for the child’s sake, but in this isolated space where she only faced Ulrich, she couldn’t bring herself to do so because she was too glad to see someone else.

 

By now, Lisbell could distinguish between Noah and a servant just by the sound of the door opening.

 

With Noah visiting so often, Lisbell could no longer just lie in bed idly staring at the clouds. Though she couldn’t cover the shackles, she had to at least cover her body, marked with various traces from their sexual encounters. Exposing her blemished body was not only harmful to the child’s well-being but also did nothing for her self-esteem.

 

There were many things to consider, but what puzzled her most was Ulrich’s behavior. His mercy, which she had believed would only last once, was surprisingly ongoing.

 

Noah, who initially visited with empty hands, now came into the bedroom carrying a book, asking her to read to him. While she was caring for Noah, Ulrich would always sit nearby, watching the two of them.

 

Sometimes he reviewed documents he hadn’t been able to check while confined to the bedroom, or he would answer something over the phone, but his eyes were always fixed on her and the child.

 

She wondered why he did this but never asked. By now, every word that came out of his mouth terrified her.

 

She also had a faint wish not to break this moment.

 

When Noah was there, she didn’t have to forcibly mix bodies with Ulrich, and for a brief moment, she could forget about the shackle around her neck.

 

Noah had once been curious about the shackle around her neck, but Lisbell had managed to redirect his attention to something else, so now he seemed to regard it as just a peculiar accessory. The child’s innocence allowed her to escape questioning.

 

Spending time with Noah under Ulrich’s gaze, which felt like the muzzle of a gun that could fire at any moment, was nerve-wracking.

 

At first, it certainly was, but as time went on, she began to feel sad. It was a small, newly opened vent. When she was with Noah, that vent pulsed as if it had a heartbeat, but when the child disappeared, it would hide like a ghost, functioning so subtly that she hardly noticed it.

 

It felt like living a life where day and night constantly switched places without rest.

 

The memory of yesterday, reading a book with Noah sitting on her lap, felt like day, while waking up now and groggily facing a table set with food felt like the dead of night.

 

Even if a ray of sunlight pierced through and sparrows chirped on the dry branches to announce the start of the day, it was midnight for Lisbell.

 

As she picked at her food without appetite, Ulrich, who had been reading a tabloid on the side, approached the bed.

 

“Even Noah eats more than you.”

 

There was a subtle threat wrapped in those words. Ulrich, who knew all too well how important the time spent with Noah was to her, was also the one who could control that meeting. So, the meaning was clear: if she wanted to continue seeing the child, she’d better start eating.

 

She knew it wouldn’t help to defy his will, but that didn’t mean she wanted to comply easily either. In a small act of defiance, Lisbell put down her fork and picked up her cup. As she took a sip of warm milk, Ulrich was already on the bed.

 

Her uncombed hair was pushed behind her ear. He swept aside her gray hair and kissed her pale cheek. Instead of pulling away, he licked her soft cheek and bit it gently with his teeth.

 

“If you’re hungry, you can eat yourself.”

 

As soon as she snapped at him, sensing he would devour her flesh if left unchecked, Ulrich laughed. She had hoped that speaking up would make him move away, but instead, he pulled Lisbell into his lap.

 

When she twisted her waist in discomfort at suddenly finding herself sitting on him, he grabbed the inside of her thigh tightly. Sensing a strange threat, Lisbell stopped struggling, and Ulrich slid his hand further inside, teasing the pubic hair under her triangle of underwear.

 

“Do you like the child that much?”

 

He asked as if genuinely curious.

 

Lisbell continued to drink her milk without answering. Watching her from an angle, Ulrich rested his chin on her slender shoulder and took the milk cup from her hand. As his hand suddenly intruded, Lisbell’s head naturally turned toward him.

 

“Suddenly, I’m curious.”

 

Ulrich grabbed one of her breasts with his free hand. The rough grip crushed the small mound of flesh.

 

It hurt as if her breast was being torn off, causing Lisbell’s face to contort.

 

“Does your breast swell when you’re pregnant?”

 

His voice, laced with lecherous curiosity, crept around her ear in a chilling whisper.


“Wh-… Ugh.”

 

“They say the nipples get bigger since they need to produce milk.”

 

Muttering like a scholar consumed by insatiable curiosity, Ulrich gathered Lisbell’s breast into a single point. What was once nearly flat was now bunched into a small lump.

 

However, it was clear that this was solely due to physical force, as the skin flushed red. Her delicate skin bruised easily under such pressure, leaving visible marks.

 

Ignoring whether she was in pain, Ulrich grabbed the thickened nipple at the center of her breast.

 

“Ah!”

 

A sharp gasp escaped Lisbell’s lips. As he twisted the already captured nipple, he stared obsessively at her breast with glazed eyes.

 

Lisbell tried to push his arm away, panting heavily. But every time he boldly rolled the rounded nub between his fingers, her fingertips trembled helplessly.

 

“If milk starts coming out here…”

 

As if something had come to mind, Ulrich tilted the glass of milk he was holding. As the milk dampened her chest, a rich, creamy scent filled the air. Lisbell’s eyes widened as the front of her upper body became soaked in the white liquid.

 

“Will it look like this?”

 

His chuckling laughter brushed against her ears. Realizing belatedly what he had done, Lisbell spread her legs clumsily, trying to shake him off. But with her breast already caught in his grasp, escaping was impossible.

 

“This, what is…”

 

“I’m really curious—would you like to try getting pregnant?”

 

The words that had formed in her mouth tumbled around wildly. Unable to hide her panic, Lisbell tried to grip his arm, but she couldn’t resist the force pulling her waist back down. Then he whispered crudely into her ear, “Ah, if you sit like that, you’re going to crush my cock.”

 

Then he bent his head down, aiming for her breast, which was firmly held in his grasp.

 

A milky white liquid dripped down her flat chest, pooling on the flesh tightly gathered in Ulrich’s hand, and eventually collected on the tip of her nipple, now a lush coral color.

 

Ulrich licked it up like a parched man. The sensitivity of the area made her body react instantly, her hips trembling as she threw her head back.

 

“Hngh…!”

 

Ulrich lifted her chin, tilting her face towards him. As soon as their eyes met, his lips pressed against hers. The rich taste and scent of milk lingered on the tongue that parted her lips.

 

“Shh…”

 

As soon as their lips parted, his soft exhalation caused Lisbell’s vision to blur. Ulrich’s arrogant gaze slid smoothly to a corner of the bedroom.

 

“If you make such a cute sound, the child hiding in the wardrobe might come out.”

 

A chilling shiver shot from the top of her head to the soles of her feet. Her fine hairs stood on end. Lisbell’s wide, round eyes darted to the wardrobe as if someone had grabbed her and twisted her gaze towards it.

 

The wardrobe was tightly closed, as usual.

 

It couldn’t be.

 

Noah couldn’t possibly be there.

 

The child had hidden there before, but that was only to hide from Ulrich before he knew of the boy’s existence. Since then, Noah had openly come to this bedroom without hiding.

 

Didn’t that happen just yesterday?

 

So, despite the clear evidence that Ulrich was lying, she couldn’t easily relax. There was always a lingering doubt at the back of her mind, even when spending time with Noah.

 

What was Ulrich’s true intention in letting her spend time with Noah?

 

Up until now, she had chalked it up to his fickle sympathy, but how could she know for sure that he hadn’t suddenly changed his mind? And even if he hadn’t, would he be so immoral as to lock the child in the wardrobe and force him to watch what they were doing…?




Did she still have a shred of trust left?

 

An unforgettable and unforgivable event existed between her and him. He was the man who had hidden his mother’s death and used her as a means to oppress Lisbell. Such a person, even if it was just a naïve child, wouldn’t hesitate to use Noah as a means.

 

As her thoughts raced to this conclusion, the blood vessels throughout her body tightened.

 

If her suspicion was correct, there was only one answer.

 

If there really was a child in that wardrobe…

 

“Hngh…! Ah!”

 

Ulrich suddenly took her nipple into his mouth. The force with which he sucked, pulling her breast as if it would tear off, instantly shattered her precariously stacked thoughts.

 

Lisbell swung her arms wildly, accidentally knocking over the bedside table.

 

Food spilled everywhere, and the crashing sound of falling dishes filled the air. The noise faded into the background as her embarrassment overwhelmed her senses.

 

With the bedside table out of the way, Ulrich grabbed both of Lisbell’s thighs, spreading them wide open towards the wardrobe. The exposed skin, covered in fine, sparse hair, was laid bare without any cover.

 

“Don’t, don’t… Please, don’t!”

 

There was no child.

 

Surely there wasn’t.

 

There couldn’t be.

 

But what if there was?

 

A moment ago, she hadn’t even thought about the wardrobe, but now she was obsessively aware of it. Every time she became conscious of the possibility that someone might be hiding in there, secretly watching, her private parts tingled with a sharp sensation.

 

It quickly became a reality. Ulrich had moved his hand from her breast to her lower body, rubbing and stroking her intimately.

 

“If you keep rubbing the nipple, milk might actually come out.”

 

“That’s… impossible… Hngh!”

 

One hand on her breast, the other on her lower body, he rubbed, stroked, and pinched her relentlessly. Every teasing touch made Lisbell feel like her body was being violated.

 

She tried to dig her nails into his forearm, but she quickly covered her mouth. Ulrich laughed wickedly, twisting her now hardened nipple with force.

 

“Noah, the boy you kindly named, was brought to this mansion as if he were kidnapped, without even weaning off his mother’s milk.”

 

“Hngh, ugh…!”

 

“Who knows? Maybe Noah always rubbed his face against you because your breasts still smelled like milk.”

 

He had clearly been observing closely whenever she held Noah in her arms, paying attention to even the smallest details.

 

Lisbell wanted to argue against him, but the tingling sensation in her back made her focus on closing her thighs. Ulrich slid a finger inside her, brushing against her inner walls deeply as he pushed it in.

 

“Nngh…! Hngh.”

 

“Already so wet again. It seems you get more excited when you think someone’s watching.”

 

He whispered lewdly in her ear, his breath warm.

 

He withdrew his finger, now coated with her moisture. His middle finger glistened with wetness.

 

Without hesitation, Ulrich brought it to his mouth and sucked on it. The more he played with his tongue, the heavier the object pressing against Lisbell’s hips grew.

 

“Do you like the idea of being seen while you’re being filled?”

 

Her mouth was full of saliva that she couldn’t swallow, but Lisbell felt her mouth drying out instead. Her thoughts refused to come together, crumbling like a damaged structure.

 

Biting her lower lip until it bled, Lisbell managed to push his thigh away, collapsing forward.

 

“Don’t… don’t do this. Please, stop… please…”

 

Clear fluid dripped from her private area, trickling down her inner thighs, which trembled uncontrollably. Unable to gather any strength, she began to crawl away. As she did, the air on her exposed back sent shivers down her spine.

 

He slapped her buttocks, which had turned a pale pink like ripe peaches, then got up from the bed.

 

Moving leisurely, he walked to the wardrobe and flung the doors wide open.

 

Lisbell, trembling in fear and unable to turn her head, finally dared to look and saw the wardrobe was empty. She stared blankly at the dark void inside, which seemed to mock her cruelly.


Ulrich approached the bed, keeping Lisbell, who had turned into a stone statue, in his sight. He bent down and sat to meet her gaze.

 

“Do you really think he’s here?”

 



 

“You can be so naïve at times.”

 

His tone still carried traces of a laugh he couldn’t suppress. As each of his words reached her ears, a strange, high-pitched ringing overwhelmed her mind.

 

The invisible form of contempt quickly morphed into an intense, stinging anger. Like a volcano erupting inside her, unbearable fury surged through her body. By the time Lisbell regained her senses, she was already lunging at him.

 

Smack!

 

The sound of her palm striking his cheek echoed ominously.

 

Even that didn’t quell Lisbell’s anger. She wildly flailed her arms, hitting him indiscriminately. Ulrich, though struck hard enough to feel pain, remained unbothered. Instead, he laughed heartily, as if he were truly enjoying himself.

 

One side was brimming with anger, while the other side remained leisurely and smiling. The scene in the bedroom resembled a strange phenomenon of winter.

 

Seeing him genuinely enjoying this only fueled Lisbell’s rage further. Just as she thought she could manage to strike his other cheek, her wrist was grabbed and pulled backward.

 

The moment her body collapsed onto the bed, it felt like she was falling from a great height.

 

“Let go, let go of me!”

 

She clawed at him with her nails. Ulrich deftly avoided her savage attempts to harm him and extended his arm, laughing aloud.

 

Her agitated words were cut off as Ulrich covered her mouth with his hand, pressing down firmly. It was a way to stifle her breathing without needing to grasp her neck.

 

Gasping, Lisbell desperately tried to inhale, but the air she took in couldn’t pass through her throat and instead leaked back out. As she became more exhausted, her lungs constricted, and her vision blurred.

 

Through the barely regained focus, she saw his cunning smile. Although he had been struck only once, the corner of his mouth had split, a small drop of blood forming there, making the scene even more grotesque and terrifying.

 

“I wondered how long you could keep up this innocent act for a few days… but as expected, you couldn’t last long, Lisbell.”

 

“Let… go…!”

 

“You’re such an exhausting and cute person.”

 

Her body was pressed deeper into the bed. It felt as though her entire body was being crushed under a boulder. Blood rushed to Lisbell’s pale face. At the moment when Ulrich’s gaze turned as sharp as the edge of broken glass, he removed the hand that had been holding her down.

 

As Lisbell struggled to catch her breath, Ulrich adjusted her legs, which had been splayed apart, and rubbed his hardened dick against her groin.

 

His swollen tip, already wet from the fluids he had leaked, probed for her soft entrance, parting her as it pushed inside her body.

 

Lisbell’s limbs stiffened like stones. But only for a moment, as he began to move his hips slowly, thrusting into her. Her toes curled inward and then straightened in time with his rhythmic movements. Her legs, bent at an awkward angle, floated in the air, gently tapping his shoulders.

 

“Forget about Gwen’s child now.”

 

The deeper he thrust, the more she felt like she was suffocating. Lisbell’s indistinguishable moans spilled out uncontrollably.

 

Ulrich grabbed her knee, pressing down to deepen their connection. Their joined bodies stuck together like they were desperately trying to meld into one. The fluids seeping out between them acted as a lubricant, aiding his movements.

 

“I’ll give you a child instead.”

 

“Ah… ah…”

 

“I used to think that children were noisy and troublesome….”

 

Ulrich let out a pleasant groan, as if expressing his heightened pleasure. His low, heavy breathing felt unnaturally hot, especially for winter.

 

“But if it’s a child who looks like you… maybe one wouldn’t be so bad.”

 

What… what is he saying?

 

What… is this supposed to mean?

 

I don’t understand.

 

It’s like my consciousness and thoughts are sinking into the mud.

 

Lisbell stared at the trembling ceiling, gulping for air.

 

For a moment, the bitter despair made her think it might be better if her breath just stopped, but that feeling passed quickly as her body began to respond honestly. The heat that started to pool below her navel spread like it was massaging her entire body.

 

The strange moans filling the bedroom air fueled her confusion. She felt herself involuntarily reacting below. Ulrich occasionally rubbed her clitoris, pulling at the insides of her thighs to drive his shaft deeper into her, pressing it all the way to the root. He roughly thrust his hips to scrape her inner walls.

 

A strange pleasure seeped through her delicate tissues, making her nerves tangle. Her scalp tingled with heat.

 

Ulrich, who had been energetically moving his hips like a racehorse since morning, came earlier than usual. Perhaps intent on keeping his word, he didn’t withdraw his penis.

 

Her fragile violet eyes rolled downward as if in shock. It was an expression of disbelief at what had just happened.

 

Seeing her reaction, Ulrich laughed joyfully as he covered her lower abdomen, still firmly lodged inside her. His hand moved over her belly as if hoping his seed would seep into every corner.

 

It felt like something filthy and vile was being poured into her.

 

Lisbell couldn’t bear the harsh reality of her relentless abuse and closed her eyes.

 

“Forget about Gwen’s child now.”

 

She vaguely understood the meaning of those words shortly after they were abruptly thrown at her. From the day after he released his vile discharge inside her, Noah was nowhere to be seen in this bedroom.

 

She only remembered two instances when the child had sneaked into this bedroom. After being caught hiding in the wardrobe, he had started coming and going openly.

 

What were the chances that Noah had suddenly matured overnight and realized he shouldn’t freely enter his uncle’s bedroom?

 

The likelihood was incredibly low.

 

What could that mean?

 

It probably meant that Ulrich, the master of this bedroom and the one with the most power over the child’s life after his wife, had blocked Noah from entering.

 

It didn’t make sense. Was it really his hobby to give hope only to snatch it away?

 

If he was going to do this suddenly, why had he allowed Noah to stay here? Why had he given the child, and me, small, warm moments only to take them away colder than the winter sea?

 

Without Noah, life returned to the pitch-black darkness it had been before. Lisbell lay on her side, weakly rubbing her eyes. Her feeble hand soon dropped to her navel. She thought she had no more tears left, but fresh ones welled up and soaked the bed.

 

“What did you do to Noah?”

 

“What did you do to Noah!”

 

“Why are you doing this to him? He did nothing wrong….”

 

It wasn’t that Lisbell had done nothing. She had clung to his clothes, desperately trying to get any news of Noah.

 

But Ulrich responded coldly. He never gave her the answer she wanted and instead forced himself on her whenever she mentioned Noah, leaving his mark inside her.

 

Each time, the words he had once said about giving her his child returned as a cruel echo, tearing at her eardrums.

 

It felt like a vicious ploy to quickly make her forget her brother’s illegitimate child, making Lisbell too terrified even to speak of him.

 

Pregnant with his child? She had never considered it until now. She had assumed he didn’t want children either. She thought that’s why they used contraception regularly. Despite their numerous nightly encounters, she hadn’t become pregnant, so she assumed that was the reason.

 

But now, the very thing she had dismissed might become a reality….

 

It was the worst. Perhaps even worse than that.

 

Lately, she was busy trying to rid herself of the negative emotions that surged like a rising tide whenever she regained consciousness. Fear, dread, anxiety, unease….

 

And when those were gone, there was nothing left inside.

 

She wondered if this was what it felt like to hold onto emptiness, as if grasping at anything would be futile. Whether she looked at or felt something, it all seemed in vain. Lisbell tried listing the differences between herself and a corpse in her mind, but the attempt only deepened her despair, so she gave up.

 

The bedroom was quiet. The silence wrapping around her was awkward.

 

It seemed that Ulrich had an important engagement, something unavoidable, and had left for the first time in a while.

 

It was still early, and as she woke from sleep, she vaguely remembered him holding her and saying something while pressing his lips to her temple. But she couldn’t recall what it was. Given his recent behavior, she didn’t want to remember.

 

All she felt was disgust at how this man treated her as if she were his beloved mistress.


As Lisbell shook her head, she felt the heavy weight of the shackles. The presence of the chains connected to the bedpost followed her every movement. Even when she remained still, the expected sensations, sounds, and weight continued to hinder her movements.

 

Reality was always overwhelming and immense, and the more she resisted, the more it seemed to consume her. Lisbell no longer wished to be strangled by the anxiety and unease that enveloped her.

 

If remaining still was the path to comfort, perhaps it was better to choose it. Unable to move of her own free will and incapable of achieving anything even if she wanted to, she gradually resigned, compromised, and submitted.

 

Footsteps could be heard in the distance.

 

Perhaps Ulrich hadn’t fully closed the bedroom door, or maybe it was something else, but she didn’t care. It was obvious that it was one of the servants who didn’t even treat her as a living person. It was better to let them pass by than to face them in this wretched state.

 

“She’s still alive, right?”

 

At the unfamiliar voice that pierced her ears, she froze.

 

A beat later, she abruptly sat up.

 

The dull throbbing pain climbing up her spine and the tightening pain in her cramped thighs couldn’t surpass the chilling sensation that caused the hairs on her head to stand on end.

 

It was only now that she noticed the wide-open bedroom door and the woman standing in front of it—Cora Altahart.

 

This wasn’t a dream.

 

She was undeniably real.

 

“I was surprised. For a moment, I thought my son had been holding onto a corpse all this time.”

 

Though she sounded somewhat relieved, her expression didn’t reflect it. As the sound of her heels clicked, the woman entered the excessively luxurious prison where Lisbell was confined and quietly surveyed the room.

 

The elderly butler, presumed to have opened the door for her, brought over a chair. Cora sat in it with a composed manner, in a spot where she could see the bed directly.

 

Thus, Lisbell was forced to face her without even properly adjusting her clothes.

 

“Miss Osborne, I’m someone who believes time is money.”

 



 

“Especially for people like us, every minute and second can sometimes realize something more valuable than gold.”

 

Lisbell’s frantic movements to pull the blanket over her naked body slowed down. Seeing that Lisbell couldn’t grasp the meaning behind her words, Cora stopped speaking in circles.

 

“It means I don’t want to waste much of my time in such a degrading place.”

 

She let out a faint sigh. It was unclear whether she found the time she was spending here truly regrettable or whether she found it distasteful that she had to personally step into this situation.

 

“It’s the first time Ulrich has behaved in such a manner.”

 



 

“Unlike Gwen, he’s usually rational and logical… He’s sharp enough to distinguish whether his actions will harm or benefit him.”

 

The blue eyes beneath her lowered eyelids quivered as if mimicking unending sorrow.

 

“I didn’t raise such a beast as my son…”

 



 

“So ignorant, so utterly vulgar.”

 

She clicked her tongue softly.

 

Lisbell quickly realized who Cora was thinking of. At the same time, she confronted an answer to a question she had long avoided.

 

Julian Scott—his death.

 

Having experienced the death of her son’s lover, Cora now trembled with emotions, whether sorrow or anger, that she couldn’t distinguish.

 

Cora’s gaze, previously fixed on a diagonal line, lifted. When their eyes met again, Lisbell felt as though an invisible spear had pierced her chest. Strangely, at that moment, she was convinced that this woman was indeed Ulrich’s mother.

 

“It occurred to me that perhaps you, Miss Osborne, are the one making Ulrich this way.”

 

It was something she had already heard once before—through the late Julian Scott.

 

“Perhaps you’re the one holding the core of my son…”

 



 

“As a mother, I can’t just sit back and watch such a pathetic situation unfold.”

 

Lisbell listened to Cora’s voice without blinking an eye.

 

“Of course, even if I separate the two of you like this, Ulrich will surely start tracking you down immediately. His stubbornness surpasses even mine and Gwen’s, so there’s no way he’ll just sit idly by while this situation, which started without his consent, unfolds. So, Miss Osborne, how about hiding and taking refuge under my protection for a while?”

 

“Refuge…?”

 

“People are curious about what they can see and want to know more about it. When it’s out of sight, their interest gradually diminishes. If you keep physically distant from Ulrich for long enough, there will come a moment when even the fleeting interest he had in you will wither away. I can hide you until Ulrich reaches that point.”

 

Two things became clear.

 

First, Cora had the ability to make her words a reality. Second, she was desperate to tear Lisbell away from her son, like a leech clinging to him.

 

Even if it meant wasting her golden time and money, as she had said.

 

By the time she realized this, Lisbell’s lips had already parted.

 

“My mother…”

 



 

“As long as my mother is held hostage, I cannot be free from your son.”

 

Cora’s eyebrows slightly raised. Having seen Ulrich make such an expression from time to time, Lisbell was filled with an indescribable sense of dread.

 

“You must be talking about your mother’s remains, which are stored at the Royal Hospital.”

 

“I have a request. I would like to hold my mother’s funeral.”

 

Knowing it was a difficult request, she still voiced it.

 

As expected, Cora reacted as if she had heard something utterly absurd.

 

“From now on, Miss Osborne, you will be a fugitive from my son.”

 



 

“Are you even aware of that?”

 

It was a harsh rebuke, questioning whether she thought she could hold such a ceremony as a fugitive.

 

But Lisbell couldn’t give up.

 

Given the current situation, their desires were evenly matched.

 

Just as Lisbell desperately wanted to escape from this bedroom, Cora was equally determined to sever her connection with Ulrich by any means. That was likely why she had secretly visited the bedroom while her son was away.

 

Unlike Lisbell, who could only harbor futile wishes, Cora had the ability and status to act on hers. And as someone with that power, perhaps it wouldn’t be too difficult for her to arrange a proper end for Lisbell’s mother.

 

“I was wronged by your son. If he hadn’t blackmailed me using my mother as leverage, I wouldn’t have been dragged to the capital like this. Given that I ended up in this situation trying to take responsibility for my mother’s life and death, urging me to run away while neglecting that issue doesn’t serve as any kind of incentive for me.”

 



 

“If anything, I might cling to your son for the rest of my life, driven by a desire for revenge, to harm him in any way I can. Or, when I get out of here, I might even report his actions to every newspaper.”

 

Though she spoke calmly, it was nothing more or less than a threat. Cora, realizing this, remained silent for a moment. Then her sharp blue eyes fixated on Lisbell as if they were piercing through her.

 

“What exactly do you want?”

 

“Is holding a funeral really that difficult?”

 

“I’m advising against it for your own sake. How many eyes do you think are watching our family in the capital? If word spreads that I’ve presided over the funeral of some commoner with no ties to us, whether you like it or not, you’ll be entangled with our family for the rest of your life.”

 



 

“Your mother’s funeral would become a noisy affair. There might even be some crazy journalist who would dig up her grave, trying to find some connection to our family. As you know, the capital is filled with vultures hungry for gossip.”

 



 

“Miss Osborne, if your goal is to see your name mentioned in the newspapers every day, I won’t stop you.”


The intention behind the warning was clear.

 

Just the thought made Lisbell bite her lower lip in disgust.

 

Indeed, holding a funeral was an excessive demand, even in her own eyes.

 

Even in ordinary circumstances, this would have been a difficult and overwhelming situation. But trying to complete it in such a fallen state was undoubtedly overreaching.

 

“…If there’s a church close to the hospital, I’d like my mother to be buried there. And I want to receive the belongings she had before she passed away as mementos. Even the clothes she was wearing would be fine.”

 

The lady, who had been deep in thought with a noble demeanor, nodded after a moment.

 

“Alright. We’ll handle it that way.”

 

Handle.

 

The cold, bureaucratic word sliced through her heart. Yet, a small measure of relief filled her. The thought that she wouldn’t have to leave her deceased mother in that hospital any longer loosened one of the tightly wound nerves that had been stretched thin.

 

“Pavil.”

 

“Yes, Madam. I’ll deliver the order.”

 

The butler left the bedroom after receiving the instruction.

 

“Ulrich will have to go on a business trip abroad next week. I’ll make sure of it, so there won’t be any scheduling issues. By that time, you should have dealt with Miss Osborne’s request regarding her mother. If that’s taken care of, there won’t be any objection to you following me, will there?”

 

“…Yes. But where are we going?”

 

“I have a villa on the Orkenian coastline in the northwest, bought under someone else’s name, so neither Gwen nor Ulrich knows of its existence. We’ll stay there for a while and observe the situation.”

 

It was as if the allotted time had ended, as the lady rose from her chair. Lisbell, not expecting any parting words, was struck by the coldness of her retreating figure and hurriedly spoke.

 

“Madam…!”

 

Thankfully, she stopped. Lisbell swallowed nervously.

 

“The child…”

 



 

“Is Gwen’s child alright?”

 

For a moment, the lady’s eyes wavered slightly. Though she quickly regained her composure, an inexplicable chill lingered.

 

“I don’t know.”

 

“What? You don’t know…? What do you mean?”

 

“The child was sent to Thukenia a few days ago. It’s a country with a systematic education and training institution for raising children to become extraordinary prodigies. Since the child is no longer staying at this mansion, I have no quick way to check on him.”

 

Lisbell had heard of Thukenia before. It was a country far from here, from Rechem—almost on the other side of the world.

 

Noah was sent there?

 

Why?

 

As Lisbell stood in shock, the lady sighed.

 

“I’m already aware that the child had been visiting here for some time. I also know it was because Ulrich granted your request.”

 



 

“Miss Osborne, did you really not foresee this?”

 

…What?

 

Lisbell’s lips parted like a fool’s.

 

Why, why is she asking me that?

 

Why is she asking me when I can’t even begin to understand why Noah was sent to Thukenia?

 

It felt as if an invisible hammer had struck her brain.

 

It’s my fault.

 

Because of me… Noah was sent there.

 

And the one who did it was undoubtedly…

 

“This is why it’s dangerous to give your affections indiscriminately. Do you think Gwen’s death and that child’s situation never once crossed my mind?”

 



 

“But such reckless interference can end up being a poison to the child, which is why I didn’t intervene. Sometimes, there are reasons behind neglect. As you can see, your inability to endure and your involvement have ultimately pushed the child into an even lonelier corner.”

 

With those words, the lady left the bedroom.

 

Left alone, Lisbell couldn’t move a finger.

 

Again.

 

Once again, a heavy weight pulled at her chest.

 

She had felt this before.

 

When it was discovered that Ulrich had hidden his mother’s corpse.

 

“I warned you.”

 

“I told you to be careful in choosing your friends….”

 

It was when Julian Scott collapsed, spraying blood, and the situation made it seem like it was all her fault.

 

This time, too. Although it was Ulrich who likely ordered Noah to be sent to that foreign land, following the chain of causality, it felt as though the root cause was her.

 

As if, as the lady said, Noah had been placed in a more impoverished environment because of her.

 

As if she were the main culprit tormenting that child….

 

“…Ha.”

 

Lisbell covered her mouth with her hand.

 

Her small, thin shoulders hunched. Her body, losing its balance, collapsed forward.

 

She gasped, her forehead pressed against the sheets. With trembling hands, she frantically touched her cheeks, chin, shackled neck, and arms. All were places Noah had touched when he brought books to the bedroom in the past.

 

She still remembered the warmth within them.

 

She clearly remembered the tiny hands that sought her out and relied on her….

 

“Ah….”

 

Her eyes soon became wet, and tears began to fall, drop by drop.

 

Lisbell couldn’t take her eyes off the sight of the sheets growing damp. What tormented her was the thought that Noah might be suffering even more than she was now.

 

And what truly shattered her mind was the realization that, despite this suffocating situation, she had no power to change it.

 

All she could do was sob uncontrollably, overwhelmed by the newly discovered truth. Even that brought more sorrow, and Lisbell wept, her body shaking until she finally collapsed.

 

“This is why it’s dangerous to give your affections indiscriminately.”

 

Is it really my fault?

 

Was Julian Scott’s death my fault, and the fact that young Noah was sent to an unfamiliar country overnight as well?

 

Is everything… my fault?

 

Guilt without direction stabbed at her lungs.

 

I can’t breathe.

 

I can’t breathe at all.

 

Why?

 

Why does everyone I get involved with end up like this?

 

Why do I keep bringing misfortune upon them as if I’m some living seed of calamity?

 

The outdoor sunlight, half-bent, played around her fallen ankles. But it didn’t reach Lisbell. She couldn’t feel it, as her lower body was trapped, being sucked into a swamp of ominous flames.

 

It felt as if her foot was stuck in the mouth of a monster.

 



 

The events unfolded just as the lady had said.

 

Ulrich mentioned an urgent matter that required immediate attention and spoke of a business trip, and Lisbell offered no reaction. Having shown signs of lethargy during her confinement, it wasn’t surprising that no one noticed the further blow to her spirit.

 

As soon as Ulrich left the mansion, several people entered the bedroom. The lady, the butler, and a man she had never seen before followed.

 

The unfamiliar man inspected Lisbell thoroughly under the lady’s orders. Only after a while did Lisbell realize he was a doctor. After completing various examinations, the doctor shook his head at the lady.

 

The lady sighed once more, but this time, it was different. This time, it was a sigh of clear relief.

 

“Pavil.”

 

She called the butler and made a small gesture. She handed him something.

 

It was a small, black key that gleamed.

 

Lisbell immediately recognized what it was. Since waking up after being sedated, a shackle had been placed around her neck, with a small groove in the center. This key was meant to release the shackle.

 

The butler approached the bed.

 

Click.

 

As the key fit into the groove and turned, the weight around her neck vanished. The shackle fell onto the bed, heavy enough to create a deep indentation without making a sound as it landed.

 

Lisbell couldn’t believe the freedom she had regained around her neck and touched it with her fingers, as if to confirm. But there was no time to dwell on it, as she quickly showered and dressed under the lady’s supervision.

 

Even as she walked outside, the reality of what was happening didn’t seem real. She only fully grasped it when the cold outdoor wind, with its chilly scent, hit her face.

 

She had finally escaped the nightmarish bedroom.

 

“Take us to Portley Church.”

 

“Yes, Madam.”

 

The sedan carrying the two sped toward the outskirts. A brief explanation was provided as to why they were headed there. The place where her mother, who had been taken from the royal hospital, would be properly buried was none other than there.



The Portley Church in the outskirts was a very small church. Yet, its simplicity was appealing. It had a serene and unique charm, suitable for shouldering the twilight of someone’s life. This was a place where anyone could close their eyes in peace.

 

Lisbell followed the lady’s secretary to the back of the church. A few mounds of earth, gently risen, were placed in the area perpetually shaded by the building’s shadow. The secretary pointed to one of them. Realizing that this was where her mother was buried, Lisbell approached.

 

She slowly bent her knees and sat down. With her white, slender fingers, she covered the not-so-rough soil. “Mother,” she whispered, her voice weak, as if it might shatter at any moment.

 

After a while, a shadow stretched long beside Lisbell. It was Lady Altahart, who had followed with her unhurried steps. The waiting secretary handed something to her, and after a brief inspection, she passed it to Lisbell.

 

“This is….”

 

“It’s the dress that Mrs. Osborne was wearing.”

 

Lisbell dusted off her hands and received it.

 

It was a strange feeling. Her last memory of her mother was of a lifeless figure, emaciated and devoid of warmth. Yet, this dress held a faint warmth, like a small flicker of a matchstick flame that had somehow been preserved.

 

Lisbell embraced the dress with a sorrowful heart.

 

“Are you sure… that my mother is really buried here?”

 

Her mother, who had been weighed down by so many doubts, had finally found peace. In this light, such skepticism was understandable. And it seemed the lady immediately understood the nature of her doubts.

 

“It’s only been three months since I buried my first son.”

 



 

“It means I understand the value of family.”

 

Lisbell let out a dry laugh. The son you speak of had no qualms about disturbing another’s family, as if he had been meticulously sculpted from a large glacier.

 

But in the end, hasn’t it all come to this?

 

There was no point in harboring further doubts here; it would only leave her feeling more exhausted. Now, she had to force herself to swallow her belief and leave. Though the situation seemed to be escalating somewhat urgently, Lisbell knew that this was a golden opportunity that would not come twice.

 

She gently caressed the grave as if to stroke her mother one last time. May you find peace here. As she silently conveyed her inner condolences, something fell on the back of her hand.

 

A white snowflake fell from the cloudy sky.

 

Its silent descent was the purest form in the world. Lisbell stared at the crystalline essence of winter, then slowly cupped it in her hand. The cold, dense energy was tightly grasped, only to soon crumble away.

 

“If you’ve finished your farewells, let’s depart.”

 

Lady Altahart had already turned around, avoiding the snow under the umbrella held by the secretary.

 

Perhaps because it fell equally on everyone, the feeling of snow piling up on her palm wasn’t unpleasant.

 

She slowly rose, observing the energy that would blanket the world in white. Then she turned her back.

 

The cold season that one must inevitably pass through before spring arrives.

 

On the day of that year’s first snowfall, Lisbell fled from the man.

 



 

A smoothly driving sedan stopped in front of the fountain in the garden.

 

After tidying his appearance, Victor, who had gotten out of the passenger seat, approached the rear seat and opened the door. A beautiful man, showing no signs of fatigue despite the grueling march, stepped out from inside.

 

He let out a slow sigh only after fully entering the mansion.

 

Only when it was certain there were no watching eyes did he slightly loosen the tightly tied necktie. Victor followed with an even more tired expression.

 

Due to a small problem that arose in the oil business, which had passed into Ulrich’s hands after Gwen’s death, Ulrich had to leave the capital temporarily.

 

The country where they had set up their oil fields was Berzel, a distant land where they had to change cars and trains several times from Rechem. Given that they visited such a remote place in just three days, the travel fatigue was bound to weigh heavily on them.

 

In truth, this trip had a sense of incongruity.

 

The problem that arose in Berzel wasn’t significant enough to warrant calling the main family, and by the time Ulrich and Victor arrived, the issue was almost entirely resolved.

 

It was a relief that the business had suffered no serious disruptions. Therefore, Victor expected they would take their time returning after staying one day in Berzel. Since there was no urgent reason to return to the capital immediately, there was no need to hastily prepare to leave.

 

However, after assessing the situation, Ulrich seemed lost in thought before suddenly asking Victor to find the fastest train back to Rechem.

 

While inwardly astonished, Victor easily guessed why Ulrich was in such a hurry. Even now, as he watched his superior head straight to the bedroom without bothering to check any other rooms, it was clear.

 

Like breaking a bird’s wings to prevent its free flight, Ulrich was rushing back to check on the woman confined in the bedroom, who was trapped as if shackled.

 

“Thank you for your hard work. Shall I rearrange tomorrow’s schedule to be handled as much as possible within the mansion?”

 

“Yes.”

 

“Understood.”

 

Ulrich soon disappeared into the bedroom. Victor stood still, staring at the tightly closed door. Before long, he let out a groan and rubbed his forehead.

 

‘Could it be that the lady stepped in?’

 

Seeing Ulrich in such a rush, Victor briefly entertained that thought. After all, his boss’s recent actions were nothing short of criminal, to say the least.

 

He had always turned a blind eye, but as the one responsible, it was impossible not to think about it. Depriving a person of their dignity solely with wealth and power, trapping them in a bedroom like a bird without wings, was unthinkable.

 

But even the lady of the house had not spoken against her son’s bizarre behavior, so what could he, a mere secretary, possibly do?

 

Thus, he could only watch in silence, but this time, perhaps the lady had finally acted. If the suspicious Berzel trip had been a pretext for her, then even the pieces that had been difficult to understand would fit perfectly.

 

If this were true, Victor felt mixed emotions.

 

While it was right that Lisbell Osborne was freed from the bedroom as a matter of human decency, as a secretary, it was clear that his situation would be complicated for some time.

 

The fierce sibling rivalry between Ulrich and Gwen came to mind. The thought of that rivalry now transforming into a battle between mother and son made him feel as if he had aged ten years.

 

Victor rubbed his chest as if to soothe the discomfort, gave a pitying glance at the bedroom, and finally turned away.

 

Meanwhile, after entering the bedroom, Ulrich finally untied his necktie after ensuring he was out of sight.

 

He placed the long, flowing tie on the table, unbuttoned the top button of his shirt, and approached the bed.

 

The figure beneath the blanket, with its head covered, was so small that it looked like a tiny mound. Gray hair, longer than the tie, spread out over the sheets, soaked in the pale moonlight.

 

The more he took in the sight, the more his inexplicable unease from the journey gradually subsided.

 

After all, how could a woman, trapped like this, even dream of escaping? Ulrich was bemused by his own uneasiness during the trip abroad.

 

He sat on the edge of the bed and grasped the fine strands of hair to kiss them. Then he paused. Today, the hair didn’t have its usual waviness, and a foreign scent of perfume wafted up, faintly brushing against his nose.

 

In an instant, the knot that had been relaxing in his heart twisted unpleasantly.

 

His gentle, leisurely touch changed.

 

He grabbed the gray hair in front of him roughly.

 

“Kyaaah!”

 

The voice that rang out was high and delicate, but it was not the sweet voice he knew.

 

For the first time in his life, Ulrich experienced the sensation of goosebumps all over his body.


He failed to control his strength due to the unfamiliarity and swung his hand with force. The woman’s body was thrown unceremoniously beneath the bed.

 

Ulrich saw the woman’s contorted face and wiped away the last remnants of a smile. Her eyes, now filled with fear, looked at him with a vivid purple hue.

 

Gray hair and purple eyes.

 

Even the clothes draped over her body were an eyesore.

 

It was a lace slip that Lisbell used to wear when she wasn’t having sex in this bedroom.

 

So, this woman was nothing more than an imitation of Lisbell.

 

“Haha…”

 

He let out a hollow laugh and got out of bed, covering his eyes with his palm. His pupils rolled silently under his tightly shut eyelids. It was as if something was tearing through his mind.

 

After a moment, he stormed out of the bedroom with a loud bang.

 

“Young Master?”

 

Victor, who was walking down the corridor, turned around at the loud noise. Seeing the Young Master who had just entered the bedroom come out again, he quickly approached.

 

“Is it you?”

 

“Yes? …Ugh!”

 

As he got closer, Victor was grabbed by the collar and dragged roughly. Victor was pushed against the wall, unable to answer due to the sudden threat. A stern gaze bore down on his face.

 

Victor, who barely regained his senses, grabbed Ulrich’s arm.

 

“Why are you doing this! Please calm down and speak with words. Violence is not the right way, Young Master!”

 

“Do you really not know? Or are you just pretending not to?”

 

“What…?”

 

Victor looked puzzled. Ulrich’s fierce eyes darted around before he finally let go of Victor’s collar.

 

“Fine. If it’s not you, then there’s only one answer.”

 

“Yes?”

 

Without intending to explain, Ulrich immediately turned away. His steps were purposeful. Victor, who was tidying up his disheveled appearance after being grabbed by the collar, instantly realized where Ulrich was heading.

 

The sound of footsteps echoed through the moonlit corridor, as graceful yet strangely ominous as a swan cutting through water. With this dual intensity, Ulrich arrived at his mother’s bedroom and flung open the double doors without knocking.

 

There was a sense of déjà vu. He had been here before under similar circumstances when it was no ordinary matter.

 

It wasn’t hard to recall when it was.

 

Now that he thought about it, it was also related to Lisbell. He had come here to personally punish Julian Scott, who had filled her head with nonsense. Remembering this, a bitter smile crept across Ulrich’s lips.

 

“Oh my, Ulrich.”

 

His mother, sitting in front of the vanity, was just getting ready for bed. She gently caressed her blonde hair, which the servant had tidied up, and greeted her son with a soft gaze through the mirror.

 

“It seems you’ve just returned from your trip.”

 

“Are you surprised I arrived sooner than you expected?”

 

“Not at all. I was just praying to God, thankful that my only son has returned safely without any harm.”

 

Ulrich sat down in a wing chair near the vanity.

 

He crossed his legs slowly and rested his clasped hands on his knee, returning a bright smile to his mother, who was watching him.

 

“Aren’t you thanking me for successfully taking Lisbell away from me?”

 

“What nonsense are you talking about?”

 

“I’m sorry for only being honest now, but Mother, you’re not good at acting.”

 



 

“Stop putting on this boring act in front of your tired son and just answer me. Where did you take Lisbell?”

 

“If you’re referring to Miss Osborne, isn’t she in your bedroom?”

 

Ulrich’s gaze sharpened. His mother, undeterred by his piercing stare, calmly continued.

 

“Gray hair and purple eyes. A scrawny, flat body, and not very tall.”

 



 

“That’s the Miss Osborne I know.”

 

The Lisbell described by his mother was, judging by her words, close to an ordinary person with no distinct features.

 

The stark implication beneath her calm remarks was clear. She was subtly reminding him that Lisbell Osborne was so insignificant that even finding a substitute was easy, leaving no reason for him to be so obsessed.

 

One corner of his mother’s lips curled up.

 

“Calling it love seems insufficient in many ways, and calling her a mistress would be overly generous. My beloved son, is this the romance you so often spoke of to me?”

 

Watching his mother’s derisive smile, Ulrich responded with a sweet smile of his own. In stark contrast to his smile, his eyes were still, radiating a cruel heat that threatened to crush everything if provoked.

 

“Mother.”

 

Ulrich closed his eyes deeply, then opened them.

 

“Is there a reason you’re doing this to me?”

 

“A parent has a duty to guide their child down the right path.”

 



 

“I’m just fulfilling my duty, Ulrich.”

 

Haha, Ulrich laughed deeply from his throat.

 

He uncrossed his long legs. Leaning his body forward, he assumed a stance similar to a predator about to pounce on its prey. A deadly tension emanated from his slow movements.

 

“Mother, I don’t ask three times.”

 



 

“Where did you take Lisbell?”

 

His face, now devoid of any smile, was blindingly cold.

 

Even his mother, who rarely lost her composure, couldn’t help but freeze for a moment, taken aback by the intensity of his expression.

 

She let out a faint sigh. Had her son ever been this hostile toward her? Ironically, the more she encountered this unexpected side of him, the more she felt the urgency to hide that woman.

 

Lisbell’s growing presence, starting to take root in Ulrich as a new weakness, was enough of a threat to alarm his mother.

 

“I don’t know.”

 



 

“Honestly, I have no idea.”

 

Acting was always about pretending, even when you knew it was false. Both Ulrich and his mother knew her words were lies.

 

Still staring at his mother, Ulrich slowly straightened his upper body.

 

“I see.”

 

His low murmur lacked any weight.

 

His mother, looking away from him, spoke as she gazed into the mirror.

 

“While you were away on your trip, white snow fell in Lorraine. It was the first snow of the winter.”

 



 

“Spring will be very warm and refreshing. It will be the perfect season for your wedding to the Lady of Schwaben.”

 

Ah.

 

Ulrich now fully understood his mother’s intentions.

 

All of this was a ploy to fully quench the thirst for an engagement that had been grudgingly deferred in the past.

 

His suspicion was confirmed when his mother added lightly.

 

“I clearly told you, didn’t I? As long as the marriage is successful, I won’t interfere with who you choose to be with afterward.”

 

“So, if I go through with the ceremony, you’ll return Lisbell to me, is that it?”

 

“I couldn’t just sit by and watch you foolishly choose the harder path when there’s an easier one available.”

 



 

“Please don’t turn away from my intentions, which are only for your sake.”

 

Without another word, Ulrich stood up from the wing chair.

 

“Sweet dreams.”

 

It was a night where the usual farewell sounded like a strange curse.

 

After his one-sided farewell, Ulrich left his mother’s bedroom.

 

Victor, who had been waiting outside the door, quickly assessed his master’s expression. Without looking at him, Ulrich walked silently forward. Growing anxious, Victor hesitated for a moment before speaking up.

 

“What happened? Please give me a brief explanation, Young Master.”

 

“She’s become quite the thief while I was away.”

 

“Excuse me?”

 

“Mother has stolen Lisbell.”

 

Though it was anticipated, the reality still felt so far-fetched that Victor’s mouth dropped open in disbelief.

 

For the first time since leaving the bedroom, Ulrich turned his gaze toward his secretary. His firm stare was steady yet heavy, as if barely suppressing an imminent outburst of fury. This restraint only made his presence more menacing, as if the very air around him could slice skin.

 

Confronted with this almost superhuman self-control, Victor swallowed dryly.

 

“Find her.”

 

Though his tone lacked urgency, Victor heard it quite differently.

 

“Quickly.”

 

It was as if a massive, unimaginable tidal wave was looming on the horizon.


A week had passed.

 

Quick footsteps echoed through the quiet hallway of the mansion in the afternoon. Victor, who had rushed over with his eyebrows practically flying, only caught his breath when he reached his superior’s study. After swiftly adjusting his disheveled collar and sleeves, he knocked on the door.

 

“Young Master, are you there?”

 

Ulrich was seated not at his work desk, but on a sofa meant for relaxation. In front of him was a chessboard with black and white squares evenly spaced, forming a square pattern.

 

With one leg crossed, he leaned back deeply into the sofa, clenching and unclenching his rounded hand.

 

The chess pieces stood tall on the board. There was no one sitting opposite Ulrich. He was playing chess alone. It was a scene completely unchanged from what Victor had witnessed in the morning. Since the morning, Ulrich had been sitting there, playing chess alone.

 

Whenever Ulrich had something on his mind, he would pull out the chessboard like this.

 

Playing chess with others was merely a pastime, but when he played with such intense focus that even his breathing was inaudible, that was closer to the true purpose for which he used chess.

 

One might think that this was a frequent sight, but it wasn’t.

 

Seeing Ulrich play chess alone was a rare event. In this household, where everything revolved around money and desire, it was rare for anyone to face a problem complicated enough to warrant deep contemplation. For them, life was too obvious and straightforward.

 

This was one of Victor’s few consolations.

 

Because whenever Ulrich fell into such deep contemplation, it was usually followed by a major uproar. As he recalled, Ulrich had similarly played three consecutive games of chess by himself the day before he exposed his brother’s sordid scandal.

 

In other words, Ulrich was calmly preparing some sort of outrageous uproar that would turn the household upside down and dump a heap of work onto Victor, his secretary.

 

‘Calmly… if you could call it that…’

 

Is that really okay?

 

Victor had repeated that thought several times throughout the week.

 

Over the past week, Ulrich had been almost the same as usual. He handled his tasks as usual, drank coffee as usual, and smoked cigarettes as usual.

 

However, upon closer inspection, there was something subtly off from the usual.

 

Once while working, once while drinking coffee, and once while smoking. Yes, at those moments, he suddenly frowned. Since he was usually such a polished and well-mannered person, even such a trivial change stood out unusually.

 

Of course, it wasn’t the first time Victor had seen him frown, but there was a particular reason this time that made it especially worrisome. It wasn’t a common sight in everyday moments unless there was a specific circumstance, like a business plan going awry.

 

Being a noble, Ulrich had learned from a young age how to hide his emotions through his expressions. The reason Victor often found it hard to read his thoughts was because his face usually gave nothing away.

 

But as much as he had found it difficult to read Ulrich, Victor could clearly discern what emotions he was experiencing in those moments.

 

It was discomfort.

 

Victor, who swallowed dryly for no reason, approached the sofa.

 

“Find her.”

 

After issuing that order, Ulrich gave him a few additional instructions. Victor had rushed to the study to report on those matters.

 

“As you instructed, I have assigned professional trackers to follow the personal errand runners employed by the madam. They are currently tracking them based on the locations to which they have been dispatched, and I will report the results as soon as they arrive.”

 

Without a word, Ulrich placed the piece he was idly rolling between his fingers onto a black square.

 

“And one more thing, I must report a suspicious situation concerning the Schwaeben administrator. It’s information obtained from someone at the salon who was placed there on your previous orders, sir.”

 

Victor handed over the letter that he had carefully kept unwrinkled during his walk here. It was intelligence received from one of the informants Ulrich had stationed throughout Lorain to act as his eyes and ears.

 

Ulrich accepted it. His unwavering attention, which had been fixed on the chessboard, shifted to the small letter. He quickly skimmed through the contents, raised an eyebrow, and shortly after, laughed, rolling his tongue as if he had come across something amusing.

 

“Hmm, so that’s why.”

 

“This is a report based on circumstantial evidence, not something definitive yet.”

 

“No, it seems correct.”

 

Ulrich placed the letter beside the chessboard. Then he picked up the large king piece from the board. He pressed it down onto the letter.

 

“Indeed, the Daphne Schwaeben I know wasn’t the type to be desperate for marriage. She was closer to someone who loved freedom as much as I do. So I wondered why she was in such a rush. There’s always a reason for someone to act out of character.”

 

“Then… what do you think is the best course of action? Should we inform the madam about this?”

 

“No.”

 

Ulrich looked down at the chessboard, now missing the king, and then moved the remaining pieces again.

 

Victor watched his young master with complicated feelings, unable to discern what he was thinking. Unfazed by his gaze, Ulrich continued to focus on the chessboard and spoke casually.

 

“Victor.”

 

“Yes, sir.”

 

“How much personal capital do I have available right now?”

 

Victor immediately pulled out a notebook.

 

After adjusting various figures with his fountain pen, he wrote down a colossal number on a blank sheet and handed it over. Even as he continued to write something, Victor added in a low voice.

 

“If you reclaim the bonds you currently hold, along with the interest accrued, and liquidate your company shares, the amount could potentially triple from this figure. You also have some jewelry and gemstones remaining. However, the value of these fluctuates constantly, so an appraiser would be needed to determine their exact worth.”

 

“Does this include inheritance?”

 

“No, the figure is exclusive of inheritance.”

 

“I’m wealthier than I thought.”

 

Ulrich muttered with a tone as if he might whistle at any moment.

 

“With this much saved up, I should learn to spend it wisely.”

 

“…Do you have any… plans in mind?”

 

“There are always plans.”

 



 

“I’m just debating whether to go safe or bold.”

 

What could be safe, and what could be bold?

 

Whatever it was, it clearly had to do with Lisbell Osborne. That woman, whose presence had escalated the situation to this point, had become nothing but a headache for Victor.

 

Victor opened his mouth, enduring the ache in his head.

 

“But, young master, do you think Miss Osborne really… went with the madam willingly?”

 

“And if not?”

 

“While assigning someone to follow the madam’s errand runner, a thought occurred to me… Could it be possible that she took this opportunity to leave and head to Theodore Mortier?”

 

Ulrich’s hand, which had been rolling a piece, halted as if it had encountered an unexpected obstacle. It had been a long time since he’d heard that name. Now that he thought about it, there was such a person.

 

Soon after, his hand began moving naturally again.

 

Ulrich, who softly stroked the engraved side of the piece, placed it onto an empty square. His gaze, sweeping across the balanced chessboard, gleamed meaningfully.

 

“That could be possible.”

 



 

“But we needn’t worry too much about that.”

 

Victor noticed the faint smile forming silently at the corner of his master’s lips.

 

“From what I know, Theodore Mortier has a rather outstanding character. He’s simple and diligent, no doubt about it.”

 

Simple? Diligent?

 

Why was Ulrich suddenly praising Theodore Mortier’s character?

 

Ah, whatever it was, Victor quickly got a sense of it. Ulrich must have been planning something behind the scenes again. Since nothing specific came to mind, it was likely that Ulrich had devised something without Victor’s knowledge or that Victor had merely followed superficial instructions.

 

Victor’s skin prickled with goosebumps at Ulrich’s skillful maneuvering in such matters.

 

At the same time, he felt an inexplicable sense of foreboding.

 

He had no choice but to follow orders and search for Lisbell Osborne, but… was this really okay? He had a faint feeling that he could already foresee the treatment she would receive upon her return, which made him slightly nauseous.

 

But as always, he was just a servant. Any doubts or emotions he harbored were nothing but a luxury.

 

“I’ll need to meet with the Schwaben administrator soon.”

 

“Yes, I’ll arrange an appointment.”

 

“As for the location….”

 

Ulrich’s deep eyes glanced out the window.

 

While he was away on a business trip, the mansion in Lorain had returned to its original state after being blanketed in snow. The winter scenery, which had quickly disappeared without a trace, seemed fragile, as if it would soon be pushed away by the onset of early spring.

 

Spring.

 

Yes, spring.

 

“The coming spring will be exceptionally warm and fresh. It’ll be the perfect season for your marriage to Lady Schwaben.”

 

Who decided it would be that way?

 

The sparkling winter sunlight cast a chilly glow on Ulrich’s smiling face.

 

Yes, indeed.

 

Who decided that?

 

Ulrich stood up.

 

Before him lay the chessboard where he had played over five games by himself. As he observed the pieces placed with perfect precision in their designated spots, Ulrich slowly ran his hand through his hair.

 

His deliberation had ended.

 

“The Schwaben Art Museum will be a good location.”


The Schwaben Art Museum was the largest museum located in the capital, Lorange. In terms of size, it was comparable to the pride of Rechem, the Alstad Department Store, situated on the boulevard of the square.

 

The three-story building housed multiple large and small exhibition halls, a special exhibition room primarily for VIP guests, educational rooms for nurturing future artists, and a glass greenhouse for visitors to take a break.

 

Recently, with no major exhibitions scheduled, the Schwaben Art Museum was quiet. It was the same on the day Ulrich arrived by car.

 

He followed the person from the Schwaben family who had come to greet him into the museum. The sound of his shoes echoed softly and broadly over the marble floor in the lobby.

 

The place he was guided to was the special exhibition room.

 

Daphne had already arrived. She was examining the works on the walls, her posture embodying the textbook example of nobility.

 

The smooth line extending from her neck to her waist was so elegant it could only be described as artistic. Her gloved hands gathered in front of her, her careful movements that made no sound on the floor—all of it clearly showed that her education had been thorough in every detail.

 

Ulrich, with equally fluid movements, stood beside Daphne.

 

The atmosphere in the special exhibition room was quite different from the general exhibition room that branched off to the left from the lobby. This place had luxurious sofas, a drink table with decanters and teapots ready to be served at any time, and even a personal calling device to summon staff.

 

This was, in essence, the VIP room where the Schwaben family privately hosted guests.

 

The paintings displayed on the red walls, which offered a subtle and restful experience, were rare pieces obtained through high-priced auctions from foreign countries or artworks personally gifted by the royal family of Lekem. Each piece was so valuable that its worth was immeasurable.

 

“I’m so glad to be able to invite you here, Ulrich.”

 

Daphne turned slightly toward him. Ulrich, who stood with his hands behind his back, examined the artwork leisurely, as if he were alone in the room.

 

Daphne asked, somewhat surprised, “You can’t seem to take your eyes off the exhibition walls. Are you particularly interested in art?”

 

“Not really.”

 

Ulrich paused for a moment, then smiled as if recalling something, and for the first time, turned his head towards Daphne.

 

“Correction, I actually dislike it.”

 



 

“Artists often say that their souls are embedded in their works. Maybe that’s why, whenever I enter a space filled with artworks like this, I feel an unpleasant sensation as if I’m being watched from all sides.”

 



 

“It’s like feeling caught even before committing a crime. Don’t you think?”

 

“Haha, that’s an amusing thought.”

 

Daphne chuckled softly, covering her mouth with her gloved hand. Ulrich quietly observed her smiling lips. Noticing his gaze, she straightened her expression and lowered her hand.

 

The topaz ornament on Daphne’s silk gloves shimmered delicately.

 

Topaz.

 

At one point, during the process of seizing control of the family business, Ulrich had shown interest in one of its branches, the gemstone industry. Remembering the meaning of topaz from that time, Ulrich smiled quietly.

 

Daphne suggested they sit on the sofa behind them, but Ulrich declined. As a result, the two stood side by side in front of the exhibition wall, as if they had come solely to view the artworks. Two awkwardly distanced shadows were cast on the floor.

 

“Did you hear about it from my mother?”

 

“Hear about what?”

 

Daphne’s deep blinking seemed incredibly insincere to him. His hands, clasped behind his back, curled inward and then released as he turned sideways. A coldness, different from the warm indoor air, emanated from his half-lit profile.

 

“Well, why don’t you take a guess, Director?”

 

“Hmm.”

 

Daphne pretended to be deep in thought. Ulrich thought she had more talent for acting than his mother. Or maybe she wasn’t interested enough to look deeply into him.

 

“Are you referring to the spring wedding we are supposed to have?”

 

Yes, she was sometimes a woman with such boldness and audacity.

 

Ulrich let out a rare, throaty laugh. He, who laughed as brightly as a lily petal fluttering in the wind, quietly scanned the paintings on the wall.

 

“I have a question for you, Director.”

 

“Yes.”

 

“What happens if one of the paintings here is stolen?”

 

“The thief would be caught and punished as a major criminal.”

 

“And the method of punishment?”

 

“After a trial to determine the sentence, they would either serve time in prison or pay a fine equivalent to the stolen goods.”

 

“I see.”

 



 

“Then, do you also know what happens if a person is stolen?”

 

Daphne’s eyes hardened. At that moment, Ulrich realized that his mother and Daphne shared more in common than he had expected.

 

It seems my mother is more serious about this marriage than I thought.

 

Ulrich suppressed a deep sigh that welled up from his core and lifted his well-defined chin.

 

“My mother stole my person to ensure our marriage.”

 



 

“In such a case, how should she be punished? I’d like to hear your opinion, Director.”

 

Daphne breathed quietly. She seemed to realize why this topic had come up.

 

Gathering her hands in front of her, she spoke clearly.

 

“I respect Mrs. Altahart. She is a woman who can always see beyond what is immediately in front of her.”

 



 

“I’m sure she had a reason for doing so.”

 

“So, no punishment is necessary?”

 

“Yes.”

 

How predictable.

 

Ulrich brushed his hand across his lips, frowning slightly as if he had tasted something bitter. A faint rhythm was embedded in the soft hum of his thoughts as he began to calculate how to pressure others—a subtle characteristic that emerged when he started scheming.

 

“Even though I, the victim in all of this, am so displeased?”

 



 

“Now I understand why I feel so weary whenever I see you. You resemble my mother.”

 

He let out a bitter chuckle.

 

“Well, regardless, I think differently. If someone causes harm, they should face the consequences. I pondered what punishment would ensure my mother never does something like this again, and surprisingly, the answer came quickly.”

 



 

“Oh.”

 

Ulrich tilted his head slightly.

 

“I must absolutely refuse this marriage.”

 

Meeting Daphne’s gaze, he articulated each word with deliberate emphasis, as if to declare that this was the most appropriate punishment.

 

“By any means necessary, I must break off this engagement.”

 

Daphne, who had been smiling as if she were a perfect still life, slightly trembled at the corners of her mouth. Sensing her psychological retreat, Ulrich’s eyes narrowed.

 

“I wanted to meet today to present an offer to the Director of Schwaben.”

 

“An offer?”

 

“I am interested in purchasing the mine owned by the Schwaben family.”

 

“…Excuse me?”

 

“I would like you to act as the intermediary.”

 

Even Daphne, who always maintained an air of tranquility like a rose, could not manage her expression this time. It was evident that her mind was overwhelmed by the completely unexpected proposal.

 

Standing next to her, Ulrich hummed leisurely as he turned his gaze back to the exhibition wall. Then, as if remembering something forgotten, he took out a small piece of paper from his jacket pocket and handed it to her.

 

“This is the amount I am willing to pay.”

 

Though she had no intention of selling the mine, Daphne opened the paper purely out of curiosity.

 

The amount written on the white background was absurd. To an uninformed person, it would seem like a random string of numbers rather than a price—so utterly preposterous it was.

 

Does this man really have this much money?

 

At a glance, it was clear that this wasn’t the collective wealth of the Altahart family.

 

Today’s meeting was secretive, and Ulrich’s offer was so private that even Daphne, the party involved, was only learning about it now.

 

In this context, the sum he offered to break the engagement was clearly part of Ulrich’s personal fortune, money he could move without consulting anyone else to achieve his own goals.

 

She had once vaguely speculated about the wealth of the Altahart family, but perhaps all of her assumptions had been mere petty imaginings. It might be on a level so astronomical that even a criminal’s wildest dreams wouldn’t approach it.

 

The Schwaben family was also a high-ranking noble family of Rechem, both in honor and wealth. However, in front of Altahart, they were nothing more than a feeble mouse, unable to show off.


Daphne lost her composure for a moment before folding the paper she had unfolded.

 

“I’m sorry, Ulrich, but I can’t accept this deal.”

 



 

“My father has no plans to sell the mine for the next few years.”

 

Of course, that made sense.

 

The mine in the northeastern part of the Pyrrileo Empire, which they owned, was a land of milk and honey, with its value only set to rise in the future. The land, still undeveloped, held countless hidden gems. This was what had caught Lady Altahart’s eye.

 

The Altahart family currently held the only patent for gemstone crafting techniques in Rechem. They had expanded their related industries through this and had steadily grown to the level they were at now.

 

The problem was the mine, which was to be their source of wealth. In Rechem, where most of the land was fertile, there were no separate mines.

 

Thus, they had been obtaining the gems needed for their business by paying exorbitant brokerage fees and procurement costs to companies from other countries that owned mines.

 

Of course, as more gems were discovered over time and their value skyrocketed, the Altahart family’s gemstone business, which involved processing and selling these gems, became increasingly profitable. Since the profit margin was much higher than the losses, it was a business they had diligently nurtured.

 

But now, a family in Rechem had acquired a mine for the first time.

 

During the process of dealing with rare items that had been handled by the Schwaben family, a prominent family in Pyrrileo was involved, and instead of a sale amount, they received a portion of the mine they owned.

 

After that, through a behind-the-scenes deal, the engagement between Gwen, the eldest son of the Altahart family, and Daphne was arranged.

 

Although the engagement was now with Ulrich, if the marriage were to proceed, Daphne’s dowry would be that mine, and the mountain of jewels would literally become the property of the Altahart family. There would be no need to struggle to procure raw materials from other countries at exorbitant costs.

 

This was the underlying reason for the engagement between the two.

 

Ulrich nodded as if he understood.

 

“So, I’m asking that Director Schwaben be the mediator for this deal.”

 



 

“I hope you can persuade the Marquis.”

 

Daphne smiled subtly. The formal smile she usually wore now had a touch of color.

 

She was genuinely astonished.

 

“Why should I do that?”

 



 

“Ulrich, I’m on the side that wants this marriage to happen. It’s almost regrettable that you don’t see it, I’m truly serious.”

 

Oh, she was even sarcastic.

 

Ulrich realized inwardly that she was more emotional than he had thought. At the same time, it was evidence of how desperate she was for this marriage. The intelligence report delivered by Victor flashed briefly in his mind and then faded.

 

“Even if you don’t intervene, the result will be the same.”

 



 

“The mine will be mine anyway.”

 

When confidence becomes excessive, it turns into delusion. Daphne couldn’t help but question the reason for his great delusion.

 

“I’m sorry, but I don’t understand. Ulrich, I said our family has no intention of selling, so how can you believe it will happen…?”

 

“Don’t think too negatively.”

 



 

“I’m trying to give the Director a way out.”

 

“A way out?”

 

“I’m sure I mentioned it earlier. I’ll do whatever it takes to break off this engagement.”

 



 

“There won’t be a wedding between us, even if spring comes.”

 

He recalled the white curtains of the Marniya villa fluttering in the wind of Moha. Amidst that bright scene, Ulrich had once thought of someone who would face a late summer wedding. He was consumed by the malicious intent of wanting to ruin what would undoubtedly be a dull ceremony, one that even the sweltering heat couldn’t suppress.

 

It was a nostalgic heat.

 

A season he didn’t particularly like because it drained his energy and easily tired him.

 

A season that, along with the dreamed-of wedding, had been completely ruined, with violet eyes looking at him tearfully.

 

As he mulled over it, a heavy tension pulled at his lower abdomen. Whether it was due to tension, excitement, or some other unknown emotion, the fog that had clouded his thoughts briefly lifted.

 

Come to think of it, what kind of eyes did she have when she followed her mother?

 

Eyes of resignation?

 

Eyes like withered flowers?

 

Eyes drained of the noble light he had been so eager to extinguish?

 

He wasn’t sure, but he wanted to see them.

 

Even that.

 

It was then that Ulrich realized he wasn’t obsessed with the emotional changes women go through. The thought that even witnessing that moment of despair wouldn’t satisfy this question seemed futile.

 

What was this, after all?

 

If even her despair couldn’t quench this thirst, what did he want to see from Lisbell Osborne?

 

Did he really have to kill her to find the answer?

 

His logical gears started turning in reverse, spewing out crude thoughts.

 

No matter what, the answer was clear.

 

He had to get her back. Whatever he wanted to do, she had to be by his side.

 

Ulrich recalled the sensation of the fine strand of hair that had wriggled and asserted itself even while trapped in his palm. The more he thought about its shape, which was as good for stroking as it was for gripping, the deeper the smile on his lips grew.

 

“So, I have no choice but to use all the information I have.”

 



 

“There are a few other things besides the mine. Like the rumor that your father, the Marquis of Schwaben, a representative of the royalists, recently had several inappropriate meetings with the head of the Citizens’ Assembly in a private club.”

 

Daphne inhaled sharply, as if she had been stabbed in the chest.

 

Isn’t it too early?

 

Thinking this, Ulrich smiled languidly.

 

“I could leak what’s in the Director’s belly to society right now.”

 

Daphne took a step back. The sound of her heels clicking on the floor of the special exhibition room was pale. Ulrich, like a gentleman dancing the waltz, extended his stride and closed the distance in an instant. The threat was unbelievably elegant.

 

“Now do you understand?”

 



 

“How considerate I am in trying to conclude this matter with the mine.”

 

“What do you mean…?”

 

“Surely, you know better than I that there can be no such thing as eternal secrets in Laurent.”

 

Despite having always addressed her formally as ‘Director,’ he now called her ‘Lady.’ The refined and calm tone, characteristic of nobility, instantly transformed into a very lowly threat as it passed through Daphne’s ears.

 

She blinked her fragile eyes several times.

 

“Ulrich. What are you talking about from earlier…?”

 

“Was it the son of Viscount Franklin?”

 



 

“Compared to either my family or the Schwaben family, he’s far below in rank.”

 

This time, her face turned pale. Her thin arms, wrapped in gloves, clutched her abdomen as if to hide something. Ulrich’s lips curled into a deep smile on one side.

 

“Winston Franklin, wasn’t he the one? I ran into him at the White Club once. By chance, I saw him drunkenly relieving himself, and he certainly lived up to his large frame. Isn’t that all you care about when it comes to men?”

 



 

“Even so, you must be quite bold to think of dragging him into the salon lounge to roll around. You really are daring. Or maybe the thought of prying eyes all around excited you even more.”

 

Daphne staggered. Ulrich kindly extended his arm to support her. Barely avoiding a fall, she looked up with a face filled with confusion. Ulrich smiled gently at the face so close to his.

 

“From your reaction, it seems the Marquis of Schwaben doesn’t know about this.”

 



 

“I’ll have to consider whether to use the Director’s information to blackmail the Marquis or vice versa. It’ll take a few days of busy thinking to figure out which would be more efficient.”

 

“Ulrich.”

 

“If you don’t intend to give me the mine, I’ll have to ruin the Schwaben family’s honor to the ground and cancel this marriage.”

 



 

“No matter how much my mother wants the mountain of jewels, she’s not foolish enough to push for a marriage with a disgraced family. As you said, she’s very shrewd and intelligent.”

 

The warning, more brutal because of its calmness, pierced Daphne’s eardrums painfully. Ulrich, as if indicating that the conversation was over, turned toward the entrance of the exhibition room. His back, perfect without a flaw, made her shiver all the more, knowing she couldn’t hope for any mercy.


Based on his past experiences with her, she knew him as well as he knew her. Although he appeared endlessly compassionate and gentle, that was nothing more than the facade of a man aesthetically born with such a surface.

 

Once he decided to do something, he was a man without a drop of blood or tear, willing to go through with it by any means necessary.

 

That was why Daphne had no choice but to cling to him.

 

“I’ll persuade my father.”

 



 

“So that he can transfer the mine to you. So, please… just give me a little time.”

 

Ulrich looked down at the hand that barely held onto him.

 

The topaz attached to her glove lost its shine, perhaps due to the shifting position and the shadow cast above. He found the faded appearance, as if pretense had been stripped away and true innocence revealed, rather appealing.

 

“As you’ve confirmed the amount yourself, you know it’s by no means a small sum.”

 



 

“Even though things have changed, I didn’t want to act miserly over money.”

 

He slowly removed Daphne’s hand from him and bent down.

 

“Consider this the utmost sincerity I can show you, and please contact me as soon as possible.”

 



 

“I’m in a hurry right now.”

 

With those final words, Ulrich exited the special exhibition room.

 

Left alone, Daphne stood there stiffly until, at the moment when cold sweat trickled down her chin, she collapsed.

 



 

“He was so smitten by some commoner woman that he locked her up in his bedroom, put shackles on her… It was quite a commotion for several days. That didn’t seem like the Ulrich I knew at all. But now that that trouble is resolved, there’s nothing to worry about, Daphne. I hope this time you can get along well with my son. I can hardly wait for your spring wedding; it makes my heart tremble with excitement.”

 

This was the conclusion Daphne had also hoped for.

 

Ulrich was far better in looks and character than Gwen, who had originally been his fiancée, and he was the heir to a family that couldn’t even be compared to Franklin, the father of the child born out of a brief indiscretion.

 

She believed that if they held a wedding in the spring as the lady pushed for, all this disgrace could be hidden without being exposed.

 

But.

 

‘…Who is he?’

 

Daphne looked down at her hand.

 

It was trembling slightly.

 

She knew him as well as he knew her. Perhaps she felt closer to him than she ever did to Gwen, who had been his fiancée. After all, they had shared a bed at one point.

 

Back then, Ulrich acted as if there was no reason for him to remain on this earth if it wasn’t for sexual pleasure. He showed momentary enthusiasm only when they were intimate, and after that time passed, he would return to a detached, indifferent face that readily dimmed the meaning of life.

 

Daphne liked that face.

 

His lifeless, hollow, nihilistic aura was something that couldn’t be touched. There was a precarious feeling as if he might jump into any crime without hesitation. Every time they were intimate, she felt as if she were throwing off all the shackles and oppressions that surrounded her, as if in sync with him.

 

Perhaps many women who approached Ulrich at that time were similarly captivated by that mysterious atmosphere.

 

His human-but-not-human presence reminded one of a lone, noble flower blooming at the edge of a dizzying cliff. Even though they knew it would crumble meaninglessly if grasped, it stirred a reckless desire to hold it in their own hands somehow.

 

It was definitely like that.

 

‘That man…’

 

So, who exactly is he?

 

The Ulrich of now seemed like a person who had found a reason to live no matter what.

 

Desire for something was overflowing, to the point where it couldn’t be held even with both hands.

 

Color had filled his once colorless soul.

 



 

The sound of the waves waking the morning was still unfamiliar.

 

The environment that rarely became familiar made Lisbell feel as if she was dreaming, so even after waking up, she remained motionless for a long time.

 

It might not have been because of the sound of the waves. Perhaps it was the fragments of consciousness that gradually surfaced due to that sound.

 

Where is this place?

 

Why am I here now?

 

How did I end up here?

 

As she counted those things one by one, her thoughts dulled, and her body movements slowed.

 



 

She pulled the blanket, which was covering her shoulders, away and sat up. As she brushed her messy hair aside, a vague sense of reality returned.

 

Lisbell got out of bed and approached the window. In the distance, she could see the waves rushing to swallow the soft golden sand.

 

The weather was still very cold, as winter hadn’t yet ended. It had even snowed just yesterday.

 

She had wondered if the sea might freeze, but it didn’t. The sea remained solid, as if it wouldn’t even begin to freeze from just that small amount of snow, firmly crashing against the shore.

 

Before washing up, Lisbell headed toward the wardrobe. Kneeling down, she gently stroked the clothes stored inside.

 

The neatly folded garments were her mother’s clothes. In this harsh winter, where the cold relentlessly pierced her skin, Lisbell often touched those clothes, as if to hold onto her mother’s warmth.

 

Only after that did she get up and head to the bathroom.

 

After washing up, she noticed that a food tray had been placed on the table by the window, and the almost extinguished fire in the fireplace had been rekindled. She could easily guess who had entered the room while she was washing up.

 

It was the secretary who had come with her to the villa on the Orkenian coastline, under the lady’s instructions.

 

She knew that Ulrich had only one secretary, Victor Royce, but it seemed the lady had several secretaries under her command. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have been able to easily assign someone to assist her with such matters.

 

Though she was grateful for being taken care of and not forgotten… frankly, the uncomfortable feeling didn’t entirely go away.

 

Without thinking further, she sat down and ate. At least it was easier to eat than when she was at the villa in Marnia or the capital’s mansion.

 

“Haah….”

 

Perhaps because she had avoided eating while being confined, now even eating just half of the plate made her feel like her stomach would burst. Still, she felt grateful that she could at least taste the food and cleaned up the dishes. Then, she opened the window slightly.

 

A salty breeze rushed in with a whoosh. Lisbell rubbed her cheek in front of it. She couldn’t allow herself to adapt to this comfortable environment that made both body and mind lazy.

 

When she first arrived at this villa, she thought she had finally escaped from Ulrich.

 

She thought that if she hid under the lady’s protection, she could evade his relentless pursuit, and as time passed, Ulrich would eventually realize that she was a trivial existence and give up the chase.

 

Later, he would even forget that a woman named Lisbell Osborne had ever been by his side and would take another mistress as a replacement or enter into an arranged marriage between families, boldly erasing the past.

 

Though it felt like a waste of time to wait for his curiosity to shrink, and eventually fade away, it was a hundred or a thousand times better than wearing a collar around her neck and returning to that life where she was treated like less than a person.

 

At least she couldn’t deny that being under the lady’s protection, hiding like this, was far better in terms of treatment and everything else.

 

At first, she thought so, but…

 

After rubbing her cheek, Lisbell’s arm, which had been drooping down, grabbed the window frame. She leaned her head out of the window and looked around.

 

Here, the villa on the beach that the lady had arranged in secret was very quiet. The surroundings were enclosed by green mountains, and the sea, which lacked a proper port, showed no signs of human presence.

 



 

Yes, this excessively tranquil landscape suddenly planted a suspicion in Lisbell’s mind one day.

 

If she continued to hold out like this, waiting for Ulrich’s interest in her to finally dissipate, what would the lady do then?

 

Would she simply let her go?

 

Would she tell her that since her son no longer seeks her, she can return to her previous life before meeting him and live freely?

 

Would she let her go… just like that?

 

Nature has neither eyes nor ears. They breathe, but even that makes no sound. Being so desolate, they could not prove anything.

 

In other words, if Lisbell were to die here one morning, there would be no evidence left behind.

 

This chilling thought, which had struck her suddenly, was quickly shaken off with the belief that it couldn’t be true. But as time passed, it became harder and harder to dismiss.

 

The more she pondered, the more so.

 

The lady was undoubtedly protecting her, even using private power, only because Ulrich showed such strange obsession towards her. If any immediate threat to her life arose, it might change her son’s feelings, so she was keeping her around quietly.

 

But would it remain the same once Ulrich lost interest?


Faced with the moment she dreaded, she couldn’t trust that the lady would let her go easily, given all she had witnessed so far. Ulrich had always described his mother as thorough, and Julian Scott had mentioned how terrifying she could be.

 

Moreover, Lisbell had come to know too much about the family to simply cut ties. She was involved with the lady’s lover, connected to Gwen’s illegitimate child, and entangled with Ulrich Altahart in countless ways.

 

The lady might view these aspects as potential threats, uncertain of when or how they might backfire if left unattended. Considering this, Lisbell doubted whether the lady would let her leave alive once the situation was resolved.

 

In the end, even this villa couldn’t be considered safe.

 

Though she had some freedom of movement, this place was still a prison of Altahart’s making. Lisbell’s freedom remained mortgaged to that bloodline.

 

She gauged the wind blowing in through the open window. Though it only brushed her cheek for a moment, her skin quickly cooled. It was not a day suitable for taking a walk as an excuse to go outside.

 

‘Then…’

 

Her gaze slid diagonally to the half-eaten tray of food. Lisbell picked it up and quietly opened the bedroom door.

 

She descended the stairs, minimizing the sound of her footsteps.

 

“…Is that so? Then does that mean someone was tailing you? I need to know how much of the location was exposed to report to the lady. If they followed you all the way here, we can deploy people immediately…”

 

There was a telephone mounted on the wall in the villa. The lady’s secretary, whose face and back Lisbell had become familiar with, was standing in front of it.

 

He seemed to be handling some issue, as his tone was sharp while gripping the receiver. When he turned around by chance, he spotted Lisbell standing there, and abruptly stopped speaking.

 

After whispering something inaudible into the receiver, he hung up. Then, he immediately put on a businesslike smile.

 

“Do you need anything?”

 

“I finished eating and wanted to return the tray.”

 

“If you had waited, I would have come to retrieve it.”

 

Initially, she didn’t think much of such behavior. Being under the lady’s protection, she thought it was a kind gesture to prevent her from doing such cumbersome tasks.

 

But at some point, even this kindness began to seem suspicious.

 

“Did the meal suit your taste?”

 

“Yes, it was delicious.”

 

“I’ll take the tray.”

 

“Um, is there a problem?”

 

As he approached to take the tray, Lisbell asked cautiously.

 

“No, nothing at all.”

 

“But the phone call…”

 

“There was an issue with the bank in the capital. It’s an internal matter, so nothing for Miss Osborne to worry about.”

 

The secretary was adept at masking his emotions. If she hadn’t caught his behavior earlier, she might have believed him entirely.

 

“Since you’ve finished your meal, I’ll bring up some refreshments. Would you prefer coffee or tea?”

 

“Before that, could I ask… Is there a library in this villa?”

 

“A library?”

 

“Yes, it’s getting a bit dull staying in my room, so I thought I might read a book.”

 

“If you have a particular genre in mind, let me know. I can bring it to your room.”

 

This was precisely what fueled Lisbell’s suspicion.

 

Though the lady’s secretary seemed to care for her generously, his overly polite demeanor subtly restricted her movements.

 

He would come into her room while she was bathing to leave her meal, or, like now, insist on bringing her the book she wanted. These excessively polite actions seemed like tactics to keep her confined to her room.

 

And if that were true, the secretary wouldn’t be acting on his own accord. He must be following orders from above, which means the lady wanted it that way.

 

“…Any book on humanities will do. Thank you.”

 

“Alright, let’s head upstairs.”

 

As Lisbell ascended the stairs, she felt the secretary’s gaze clinging to her back. It was a feeling of being watched. Only when she entered her room did she let out the breath she had been holding.

 

Her slightly trembling hand reached for her collar.

 

It still felt suffocating.

 

This was no longer Ulrich’s bedroom, and there were no shackles, yet…

 

“…Ah.”

 

A sharp pain spread. Her subconscious was acting up again. Lisbell rubbed the area where the pain radiated, finding the skin raw and stinging.

 

Then, as she raised her head, the furnishings decorating the room rushed into her view.

 

The silver-framed sugar bowl on the table, the candle holders embossed with portraits, the small glass cabinet with gold trim, and the delicate ornaments adorned with colorful jewels inside.

 

This villa, which appeared purely antique, bore the living taste of Lady Altahart.

 

Altahart.

 

Yes, it was still Altahart.

 



 

The issue the secretary had been urgently discussing on the phone became clear a few days later.

 

“It seems we’ll have to relocate.”

 

After waking and washing up in the morning, Lisbell found, unusually, that the secretary had not disappeared but was standing in a corner of her bedroom. He then suddenly spoke.

 

“Relocate?”

 

“Yes.”

 

“…Why?”

 

“It appears that someone on the young master’s side has discovered this location.”

 

“I thought… this place was supposed to be safe?”

 

“They’ve hired professional trackers. While it’s not certain that we’ve been compromised, the location might have been exposed, so the lady issued special instructions.”

 

So the secretary politely urged her to pack as quickly as possible. Lisbell couldn’t even dry her wet hair before she had to prepare her luggage. She packed her mother’s clothes first and kept the rest to a minimum.

 

Once the bag was closed, the secretary immediately took it and headed for the door. Lisbell felt a sense of urgency as well.

 

“Where are we going?”

 

“To Ducasse. The lady has another private villa there.”

 

Just how many villas does she have?

 

The newspaper reported that the Altahart family owned over twenty villas. That number probably didn’t include these private villas. Lisbell was wondering how many there might be in total when she suddenly stopped in her tracks.

 

“Ducasse… Do you mean the desert country?”

 

“Yes, that’s correct.”

 

From the blue coastline to the scorching desert.

 

She wasn’t just surprised by the stark contrast. Ducasse was an inland region famous for its vast, sea-less deserts. It was geographically far from Rechem, a place closely connected to the sea.

 

Did they really have to go so far just to hide?

 

The only comfort in this villa was that it was within Rechem. If something terrible happened and she needed to flee, it was far more advantageous to be in her own country than in a foreign one.

 

But if she went to Ducasse, Lisbell might find herself in a situation where she couldn’t ask anyone for help.

 

The overwhelming anxiety she felt when Ulrich had insisted she come to the capital resurfaced, washing over her. The terrifying sense of dread was seeping into her heart.

 

“We’ll head to the Orkenian train station first. After that, we’ll move to Portman Harbor and board a ship.”

 

“…Are we leaving right now?”

 

“Yes.”

 

It all seemed so unplanned, but she was probably the only one who felt that way. The secretary had likely been informed in advance and had everything mapped out. The plan was probably to reach Ducasse as quickly and efficiently as possible.

 

And perhaps this sudden announcement was part of their plan. Lisbell couldn’t be sure if fleeing with these people to escape Ulrich was the right decision. Was it really the right choice to trust them in her bid to escape him? The doubts she had pushed aside in the urgency of the situation were now resurfacing.

 

“Please finish your preparations and come downstairs. I’ll be waiting in the lobby.”

 

As the secretary left, Lisbell turned to look out the window.

 

Beyond the rectangular frame, the clear seawater surged as if to swallow the world. The noisy waves seemed to whisper directly to her. Do you think you can escape from me?

 

Splash, splash.

 

The sound of the waves slapped against her ears.

 

A blue symphony.

 

Eyes that were both Ulrich’s and the lady’s.

 

Lisbell soon left the room. Behind her, the glow of one of the jeweled ornaments in the glass cabinet had mysteriously vanished.

 

They soon arrived at Orkenian Station.

 

Inside the station, where people hadn’t been seen in the past few days, it was now bustling with a crowd. Lisbell quietly clenched her hand beneath her sleeve. The jewels she had secretly taken from the villa’s glass case rattled inside her grasp. The hand holding them felt unbearably heavy. Perhaps it wasn’t just her hand, but her heart as well.

 

Stealing. 

 

Her conscience screamed silently, her turbulent mind refusing to calm down.

 

But what choice did she have?

 

At this moment, Lisbell had no means to protect herself. She didn’t even have a single penny in cash. And to Altahart, these jewels would likely be no more than trivial trinkets. Their loss would hardly be of any significance to them.

 

Reassuring herself, Lisbell straightened her back.

 

“Miss Osborne. It’s time to go.”

 

The secretary, who had finished the administrative tasks, approached. Lisbell boarded the train he led her to. Just then, another train arrived at the adjacent platform.

 

Ding, ding, ding, ding.

 

The bell signaling the departure rang out as if to pierce the sky.

 

Lisbell followed behind the secretary, glancing at the still-open doors of each car.

 

What should I do? What do I do?

 

Once she boarded this train, she would leave Rechem for good.

 

And once she left, would she be able to return easily?

 

As she wrestled with her thoughts, the bell ceased. Her heart, which had been pounding, shrank. Soon, the train began to release steam, preparing to depart. At that moment, Lisbell slipped sideways and threw herself out of the open door.

 

“Ouch!”

 

Her knees scraped painfully against the ground. The secretary, still unaware of her escape, continued walking straight ahead. Before he could turn and check behind him, Lisbell grabbed her fallen luggage and quickly stood up.

 

“Ah…!”

 

She barely took a step before collapsing forward. It seemed she had twisted her ankle when she landed. Panting heavily, she struggled to get up again. Her destination was just in front of her. Limping, she painstakingly took one step at a time.

 

Just then, the bell signaling another departure echoed across the platform. The platform was bustling as boarding time approached. Hiding amidst the crowd, Lisbell managed to slip onto the train at the adjacent platform.

 

No sooner had she boarded than the doors closed, and the train began to move. Lisbell sat down in the corridor between the cars, staring at the receding Orkenian Station. And even further away, the train she assumed the secretary had failed to disembark from.

 

‘…To act so recklessly.’

 

Now that it was done, she felt utterly drained.

 

As she buried her face in her drawn-up knees, a hollow laugh escaped her. It was the first time she had acted so rashly. She had fled without any plan, without even deciding where to go. After all, the thought of what would happen if she took that train had been too terrifying.

 

Lisbell slowly raised her bowed head.

 

She had run away from Ulrich.

 

And she had even run away from the lady.

 

She had finally regained her freedom from Altahart, but it was still incomplete. At any moment, Ulrich and the lady’s shadows could extend, grabbing hold of her again.

 

When she had been with the lady, she could at least avoid Ulrich, but now that she had fled from the lady’s side, even that could no longer be expected. And if she were caught next time, she could not expect to be treated as leniently as she had been this time.

 

But… she didn’t regret it.

 

Had she stayed with the lady, she would have been tormented by anxiety and fear in a different way. Most of all, as long as her fate depended on Ulrich’s fluctuating interest, she could not truly say she had escaped from him.

 

Was that why her heart felt so relieved?

 

‘…Where should I go now?’

 

The reality of her situation caught up with her before she could fully savor that relief. After all, she couldn’t abandon reality in favor of this fleeting sense of freedom.

 

Lisbell tried to stand up by leaning against the wall but gave up as pain shot through her ankle. As she gently examined her swollen ankle, memories—those annoying, spiteful things—resurfaced.

 

Why now, of all times, did she think of the person who had so carefully put shoes on this very foot?

 

A man who had dreamed of marrying her, who had said that the realization of that dream was just around the corner, had smiled brightly. His face was as inescapable as the sun, no matter what she did.

 

Theodore.

 

Lisbell lowered her head again and smiled.

 

How could she be so self-centered?

 

Just as she finally escaped Altahart’s shadow, as she could barely take a breath, she thought of him.

 

‘…Is it too late?’

 

Was it impossible to go back?

 

Lisbell rubbed her forehead against her knees.

 

Going back was out of the question.

 

After breaking off their engagement in the worst way possible, it would be cruel to return and tell him the truth.

 

But, but it’s too unfair.

 

It wasn’t by choice that I gave up marrying Theodore.

 

I still… Even now, the moment I lose my way, I think of Theodore’s face, which clearly shows what feelings I still have for him.

 



 

It felt too late.

 

But even so, she wanted to clear up the misunderstanding.

 

Theodore believed she had broken off their engagement because she had feelings for Ulrich. Though she had given up their future together, she wanted to make it clear that this was not the case.

 

She didn’t want Theodore to think of her as such a dreadful and horrible person.

 

Surely, that wasn’t too much to ask.

 

Lisbell carefully stood up, leaning against the wall.

 

The train, which had been racing along the tracks without a break, arrived at the next station. Just as she saw the train slowing down, a conductor approached from the end of the car to check tickets.

 

Lisbell fiddled with the jewel in her pocket. Then she turned around and moved to the next car.

 

While keeping her distance from the conductor, the train gradually slowed down and came to a full stop. As the train exhaled steam, the doors opened, and Lisbell stepped off. The pain in her ankle had significantly subsided.

 

Lisbell rolled the jewel in her hand as she exited the station, searching for someone. She needed to find someone who could exchange this jewel for cash. Just before arriving at the station, she had thought of someone who might be willing to make such a ridiculous deal.

 

Even in the crowded station, they were easy to spot once she decided to find them. Lisbell gulped and approached the scalper, who was wandering aimlessly around the station, wearing an octagonal cap.

 



 

“Can you see it?”

 

Ulrich, who was lounging deeply in a single-seat sofa, lifted his coffee cup and spoke. His soft, reproachful tone was directed at the person sitting opposite him, who had been silent for some time.

 

In his mother’s silk-gloved hand was a piece of paper. Ulrich, looking rather unimpressed, leaned his arm on the armrest, his long fingers gently twisting his platinum hair. Even this waiting time was starting to bore him.

 

“As you can see.”

 



 

“The mine in the northeastern region is now mine.”

 

“I can hardly believe it.”

 

“That’s why I asked the Schwaben family to send the documentation as soon as possible, so you wouldn’t doubt it.”

 

“I’m surprised you managed this, and even more so that the clever Lady Daphne would side with you and do something so costly.”

 

“Just to clarify, not a penny of the family’s common funds went into the mine. I handled everything with my personal assets.”

 

His mother put down the document she was holding. She touched her forehead, as if she had a headache from the unexpected situation. Although it was a bit surprising to see her not bothering to hide her irritation, he didn’t dwell on it.

 

After all, Ulrich had something more pressing on his mind.

 

“What will you do now? Will you still push ahead with the marriage to the Schwaben family?”

 

His tone was as light as a beautiful melody.

 

“How did you manage this? The Marquis of Schwaben surely knew the value of this mine.”

 

“So I blackmailed the head of the Schwaben family.”

 

A click of the tongue escaped his mother’s lips.

 

“That’s not like you.”

 

“The methods people use change depending on the circumstances.”

 

“Ulrich.”

“To be honest, it’s a bit much to call it blackmail. For the Schwaben head, it must’ve felt like a fair proposal. Instead of exposing the many secrets of their family that I uncovered, I sold the mine to them for an absurdly high price. I requested to break off the engagement as planned, while they got to keep their secrets hidden in exchange for an enormous sum. A win-win, wouldn’t you agree?”

 

“Secrets?”

 

“Surely someone as meticulous as you, Mother, wouldn’t have missed the fact that the Marquis of Schwaben has recently been in contact with the chairman of the citizens’ council.”

 



 

“And perhaps we might not have reached the life growing in the Schwaben girl’s belly. They did hide it quite thoroughly. If I hadn’t planted someone at the salon meetings she frequents, I might have been completely fooled and ended up walking down the virgin road with her as a groom destined for tragedy.”

 

A brief sigh escaped her lips.

 

“…Is it true?”

 

“You already know, Mother, that I was closely involved with Miss Schwaben for some time. She’s as free-spirited as I am. Even if she marries into a family of her choice in the future, she’s definitely not the type to cling desperately to someone.”

 

“Good heavens… Should I be praising you for this or reprimanding you?”

 

“If anything, I’d say I deserve praise. We almost ended up nurturing the worthless seed sown by some baron’s son.”

 

Ulrich set down his coffee cup, having summarized the situation succinctly. He then deliberately lowered his gaze, affecting a dejected demeanor.

 

“You may not feel it at all, but I’m deeply distressed right now, Mother.”

 



 

“Even if I wasn’t actively involved, I’ve clearly been a victim in this marriage arrangement. The fault for the breakup lies entirely with them, yet I’ve lost some of my funds due to a hasty transaction.”

 



 

“I trust you wouldn’t mention another marriage proposal to a son who’s struggling this much.”

 

That brazen comment summed up Ulrich’s true intentions.  

 

The lady looked sharply at him. Though he kept a seemingly affable smile, his eyes harbored an unyielding ferocity.  

 

“Have you found her?”

 

The lady found herself resentful for being the one to bring up the subject.  

 

Ulrich, on the other hand, responded as if he had been waiting, with an even softer smile. While his expression remained jovial, the atmosphere grew noticeably colder the more his smile deepened.  

 

“Not yet.”

 



 

“But I’ve got her trail.”

 

Of course he would. He’d hired several skilled trackers to tail her and surround her entourage.  

 

She sipped her tea in silence. Ulrich picked up the document she had set down and leisurely folded it in half. He recalled its contents as he began to speak.  

 

“If you return her now, I’ll entrust this mine to you.”  

 



 

“I’m saying I’ll transfer ownership of the mine to your name.”  

 

Her finger, hooked on the teacup’s handle, twitched slightly.  

 

Ulrich folded the document into a paper model and sent it flying. The paper flitted through the air before hitting the window frame and falling.  

 

“It’s only a matter of time. You know that better than anyone, Mother.”  

 



 

“If I find her first and stage a tearful elopement of love, what will you have left? The engagement with the Schwaben family would collapse, you wouldn’t be able to completely separate Lisbell from me, and you’d fail to secure the Schwaben family’s mine. Ultimately, you’d have nothing to show for your efforts but wasted time.”  

 



 

“And you hate wasting time more than anything, don’t you?”  

 

If she wanted to avoid that, she would need to take the mine and return his mistress, Ulrich’s calm voice suggested. To his mother’s ears, it sounded mad.  

 

How could he?  

 

What could that woman possibly be for him to handle things in such an atrocious manner?  

 

Moreover, the Schwaben family wasn’t the only one targeted by his threats. Her son had willingly placed her, too, on the chopping block, tightening his grip around her neck.  

 

It was madness.  

 

Unthinkable.  

 

No one bearing the name of Altahart should ever defy her like this. Least of all the son she had borne and raised to bring this family to greatness.  

 

Not an ounce of desire to return Lisbell Osborne stirred within her, even in response to his threats.

 

His mother silently swallowed her breath.

 

“I need time to think.”

 

The rhythmic tapping of Ulrich’s fingers against his knee ceased. His head, which had been lazily tilted to one side, slowly returned to its proper position. The movement was innocent, yet it carried an uncanny intensity that made it feel threatening.  

 

“You understand what I’m saying, don’t you?”

 

“Yes, I understand perfectly.”

 

Even so, this?

 

Ulrich felt a peculiar sense of discord.  

 

He studied his mother’s face carefully. Before long, his lips curled into a picturesque smile, one as lovely as a living painting, and he rose from the sofa.  

 

“Understood.”

 



 

“I was taught that pressing a lady is unbecoming of a gentleman.”

 

Ulrich clasped his hands behind his back like a dance step from polite society and brought one hand to his chest in an impeccably courteous bow before turning to leave.

 

The moment he turned away, the emotions drained from his face, leaving it as neutral as still water.  

 

Walking down the corridor, his platinum blonde hair shimmered like sunlight on rippling waves. The light streaming through the hallway’s windows bathed him, yet his mind was consumed with deep, persistent thoughts under the growing vigor of approaching spring.  

 

“You’re back?”

 

When he returned to the study, Victor set down the documents he’d been reviewing and stood.

 

“Shall I proceed with the transfer of ownership for the mine?”

 

“No.”

 

Victor froze, surprised, as if expecting a straightforward order to proceed. The astonishment quickly passed over his face.  

 

“Did the lady refuse?”  

 

“No.”

 

“…Then why not?”  

 

“She says she needs time.”

 

“Time…?”

 

“From your reaction, it seems I’m not the only one who finds it odd.”  

 

Time? She needed time to think?

 

Was there something lacking in his explanation?

 

The negotiation just now had been a veiled threat, explicitly outlining the benefits and losses she stood to gain. To reject it was nothing but a foolish act that would lead to unnecessary losses, something he had emphasized unequivocally.  

 

And his mother couldn’t possibly have misunderstood that.

 

So, if she understood and was still hesitating…  

 

“Why?”  

 

The mist-like question floated up, brushing against the crown of his thoughts. Suddenly, his eyes gleamed with realization.  

 

The answer was too simple.

 

There was a variable in his mother’s situation that he didn’t know about.

 

And the only person who could act as that variable right now was the one his mother had secretly whisked away from this estate—Lisbell Osborne.  

 

If something had happened to Lisbell, whom his mother was protecting, that might explain everything. She might want to accept the deal and hand Lisbell over but couldn’t because the girl was no longer within her grasp. Unable to confess this directly to him, she was instead wasting time—something she hated more than anything.  

 

Ulrich smiled, his expression as serene as a quiet night.

 

“It seems it’s time to call in a favor from our drug-peddling friend.”

 

“Excuse me?”

 

“Contact Colonel Craxson immediately. Tell him it’s an urgent matter.”  

 

Victor, without hesitation, grabbed the receiver.

 

“What should I tell him about the matter?”  

 

“Say it’s a top-secret search request.”

 



 

“If he’s uncooperative, transfer the call to my private line.”

 

Leaving Victor, who signaled his understanding, Ulrich returned to his bedroom.

 

The uncurtained window allowed sunlight to spill generously into the room, but despite the bright light, the atmosphere inside was strangely bleak.

 

Ulrich approached his bed and sat down on the edge.

 

The woman, disguised as Lisbell and lying motionless in this very room that day, had been promptly thrown out. What happened to her after that, he neither knew nor cared.

 

For some time now, whenever he returned to this bedroom, an endless wave of lethargy seemed to overwhelm him. Like a collapsing sandcastle, his upper body slouched until he was sprawled across the bed, utterly languid.

 

His outstretched hand fumbled over the sheets, his palm brushing against their frosty chill like creeping frost.

 

Lorraine was shedding the remnants of winter’s chill, stretching into the sluggish arrival of spring. Yet his bedroom alone seemed to defy this, remaining unnaturally cold.

 

How could the absence of just one person leave such a void?

 

He found the thought curious as he raised his hand into the air. His palm, opening and closing, felt the phantom touch of fine, silken strands of gray hair drifting like threads.

 

Ah, how he wanted to grab hold of them. To clutch them and never let go.  

 

To bite down and chew until they were gone…

 

And it wasn’t just the hair.

 

There was the soft flesh that melted faintly at his touch, the tender skin that flushed red at the slightest graze or lick, the delicate neckline that his face would nuzzle against, soaking him in her warm, comforting scent.

 

He wanted to crush that frail body with all his strength.

 

His hand dropped as if to grasp at the fleeting illusion, but nothing was there. His fingers brushed against something. Slowly, he pulled it up to his face with a lazy motion.

 

The coarse texture grazed his cheekbone.  

 

Thin eyelashes lifted slightly.  

 

It wasn’t the mirage of silken hair he’d imagined but a slip of fabric, held in his loosened gaze.  


He blinked, his eyes languid. His blue-gray pupils shrank, and the vision in front of him became blurry.

 

Ulrich dropped the slip he had been holding onto his face. The fabric that fell was so thin that he couldn’t even feel its weight.

 

However, lace decorated every part, covering every part of his face. He took a deep breath, his chest heaving.

 

His breath caught.

 

He could smell her scent very faintly.

 

Ulrich slowly lifted his palm and pressed the slip. Then he rubbed it so that it covered every corner of his face.

 

He felt his marble-like skin being scratched by the rough texture, but he didn’t care. Rather, the sensation of his lower body rising up as soon as he sniffed the subtle scent was a little more vivid.

 

A hot spark ignited near his navel.

 

Ulrich closed his eyes and took a deep breath. As if he was barely taking in a handful of clean air in a world covered in dust.

 

“Haa…”

 

The breath that filled his mouth and burst out was heavy and hot. The slip turned a little moist. Ulrich raised his chin as if he wanted to dig into the fabric and lowered one hand.

 

A hand that was large enough to hold anything with one hand easily untied his pants. The erection that had been rising with strength for a long time was quickly exposed to the air with a few gestures. It was so hard that the blood vessels were bulging.

 

“Haaa… ”

 

He wrapped his cock in his palm. As soon as he did, he realized that it had been a very long time. It was tingling with just the thought of her.

 

At the tip, liquid was condensing, flowing down like morning dew. The length of his p*nis was so big that it took ages to even reach the area where the balls were.

 

“Uhnng.”

 

The sound of the flesh being rubbed spread through the bedroom in the afternoon.

 

Ulrich unconsciously stuck out his tongue and flicked the hem of the slip. Even though he knew that the only thing touching his tongue would be a stiff piece of cloth.

 

However, his excitement steadily grew. As he did this, he felt like he was sniffing Lisbell’s hair. It felt like he was holding her from behind, burying his face in her light gray hair, and smacking her bottom lewdly.

 

Thinking that he was really holding her in his arms and completely burying himself inside her, his d*ck twitched a little more.

 

He gently stroked the flesh while repeatedly pulling up the slip that was about to slip from his well-toned face. He rubbed his erected dick with the calluses on each of his finger joints, and nudged his tip on his palm.

 

At long last, the hole opened up, oozing out sticky fluid. The space between Ulrich’s fingers was soon wet.

 

He imagined the pale liquid coming outside of him on Lisbell’s lips.

 

She would swallow it, her eyes tearful like a cat whose tail had been stepped on. Ah, the image of her cherry-colored lips and her throat clenching came to mind.

 

Ulrich stretched out his tongue and licked the slip, greedily.

 

“Hnng, haa.”

 

The well-built body that had been lying facing the ceiling spun around.

 

The slip draped over his face slid down and fell onto the sheet. Ulrich buried his face in it. He rubbed his eyes, nose, and mouth against the slip until he was almost out of breath, and quickly grabbed his p*nis which had risen enough to touch his belly button.

 

Squelch, squelch.

 

Every time his fingers showed a gap, sticky liquid spread out like foam. It flowed down his lower body even though he hadn’t come yet.

 

He didn’t have time to open his eyes to check the identity of the liquid. He let out a ragged breath. Like a snake entering a small hole where it had hidden its prey, it slowly wrapped itself inside the slip. The lower part of the slip that was shaped like a skirt was filled with his throbbing cock.

 

If Lisbell were wearing it, it would be between her legs.

 

As if he believed that there was a cradle-like hole inside that he could immediately poke open and enter, he bit and licked his lips and began to thrust, even putting his waist into it. He was so engrossed that beads of sweat ran down his forehead where the tendons were slightly raised.

 

If you looked at him from behind, it seemed so lewd that you would think he was really having sex with a woman. Even though he was wearing all the clothes from top to bottom, the scene was much more provocative than a naked person.

 

“Hah, haa… .”

 

Soon, his posture collapsed. His hands, which had been sticky, were helplessly covered in the gushing semen.

 

The bedroom, where only his rapid breathing had resonated for a while, soon became as cold as ice.

 

His eyes, which had been tightly shut, opened.

 

After the sexual fever that had been there for a very short time had subsided, an indescribable coldness poured down.

 

The space that had never felt empty was completely empty and noisy. It was so noisy that he felt the urge to destroy everything in this room, making my nerves tense. If it weren’t for the after effects of ejaculation that was gently biting his hands and toes right now, it might have been like that.

 

He slowly turned back to face the ceiling and lifted his hanging hand. The semen that he hadn’t been able to wipe off flowed down his palm.

 

He pulled the slip on the back of his head and wiped his semen-stained hand with it.

 

No, he thoroughly smeared the semen on it.

 

It was wet enough, but not at the same time.

 

Yes, this kind of thing wasn’t enough.

 

It wasn’t even a part of the real thing.

 

If it was real, he wouldn’t be feeling this sluggish. That fact really didn’t sit well with him.

 

How could there be something in this world that he wanted so much but couldn’t have it right away?

 

How could something like that exist?

 

If he had wanted to have it, he would have it.

 

Ulrich slowly blinked his eyes. Then, out of nowhere, a smile burst out.

 

The woman who gave me such a headache wasn’t just acting that way to him. She definitely acted as a variable for his mother, too.

 

As expected. She would have been relieved to be out of his mother’s shadow. She probably couldn’t end up bearing the pressure, so she impatiently ended up causing an accident.

 

“Oh, I love it.”

 

He really liked that uncompromising side of hers.

 

The fact that he is willing to consider her, and that she was not easily broken, is truly admirable. It was a much more admirable attitude to follow than the attitude of nobles who were always taught to maintain a straight line.

 

How was she so timid?

 

She was alert as she was gentle. Her attitude of keeping her invisible tail up high and never losing her guard made it impossible for him to resist reading her…

 

His chest tickled.

 

Ulrich rubbed his cheek against the sheets and chuckled.

 

His laughter echoed in the lonely bedroom. The strange resonance that filled the air was the only thing that filled the dull bedroom.

 



 

“… Bang!”

 

The sound of the luggage falling was loud.

 

Lisbell rubbed her arm, which was still covered with goosebumps. The passenger sitting next to her said, “Are you okay, Miss?” and held their hand out. Only then did she realize that she had dozed off and dropped her luggage on her lap.

 

“Thank you.”

 

As she took the luggage and gave a small greeting, the woman next to her wearing a beret smiled kindly.

 

Lisbell smiled awkwardly and rubbed her mouth in case she had drooled.

 

Her body was so tense that even the brief moment of sleep was fierce. She couldn’t remember what she had dreamed because it was so brief, but judging by how startled she was, it must have been a bad dream.

 

Her mind, which still couldn’t forget the crow, refused to make any further guesses. Lisbell straightened her back and looked outside the train.

 

“Um… did we pass Kings Morgan Station?”

 

“It’s the next station.”

 

Just then, the station appeared in the distance. Lisbell thanked her once more and opened her luggage. Before getting off, she checked her belongings first. Her luggage, which contained a few coins she had earned from trading jewels with black marketers, her mother’s clothes that she had kept inside, and a spare set of clothes, was very simple and, in other words, poor.

 

Lisbell counted her cash obsessively. She was glad that the deal with the black marketer went well. This was also the third time she had made a deal.

 

The black marketer she had contacted the first and second times was furious, saying that she had no idea whether the items were real or fake, and that she should just get out of here and there and not bother with her business today.

 

The third black marketer must have had an eye for jewels, so he looked around and handed over all the cash he had.


Lisbell recruited a few children playing ball in the shade near the historical landmark.

 

She handed them money, including a tip, and asked them to buy train tickets heading to three different destinations. This was to throw off any possible pursuit by Lady Altahart or Ulrich.

 

Not stopping there, she herself moved between distant, lesser-known suburban stations, places even she had never heard of. At each stop, she repeated the process, enlisting more children to purchase tickets to various locations. During the nights, she chose overnight trains where she could rest briefly.

 

This convoluted, evasive journey lasted three full days, ensuring her trail was nearly impossible to follow.

 

Feeling relatively confident she was no longer being tracked, Lisbell finally purchased a ticket to Renbruck.

 

At last, the Kings Morgan Station came into view. Her heart pounded as she realized she had arrived in the city where Theodore lived.

 

She felt the same anticipation as the first time she had left Theodore, boarding a train bound for Marnia and setting everything into motion. Slowly, imperceptibly, everything had changed since then.

 

She wished for the beginning and end to mirror each other.

 

That, by traveling on this train to see Theodore, her connection with Ulrich could finally be severed.

 

A thread, frayed and cut. A breath, exhaled and lost.

 

Her desperate thoughts accompanied her as the train slowed to a stop.

 

Lisbell stepped off awkwardly, setting foot on the soil.

 

‘This is Theodore’s hometown.’

 

Since it was part of Lekem, the lifestyle wasn’t vastly different from the places she had been. Yet, there was a vibrant, bustling energy unique to an emerging industrial city.

 

She looked off into the distance, where tall factory chimneys rose into the sky. Among them, Theodore’s father’s textile factory must be there.

 

Seeing this made her journey feel real. She had truly come to see Theodore.

 

First, Lisbell visited a general store near the plaza to purchase a cloche hat and cape. Being a fugitive of sorts, she couldn’t casually flaunt her appearance. Thankfully, the city catered to a bourgeois crowd, and the prices weren’t steep.

 

“Do you happen to know anything about a Mr. Motier, who operates a textile factory?” she hesitantly asked the shopkeeper assisting her with the cape.

 

“Mr. Kedin Motier, you mean? He’s a kind gentleman. Sometimes, when passing by, he buys flowers from the basket girls. He once told me it was to gift to his wife.”

 

Kedin Motier—that was Theodore’s father.

 

The anecdote reflected the warm personality Lisbell had experienced in Theodore, and she pondered it for a moment. The shopkeeper, noticing her expression, smiled knowingly.

 

“Are you looking for Mr. Motier?”

 

“Ah, yes. I have business with his son.”

 

“Oh, I see! I don’t know his name, but I remember his face. He’s quite striking, just like his father.”

 

Lisbell nodded absentmindedly. Memories of that striking face buried in her lap, weeping, came to mind. Whatever expression she made must have amused the shopkeeper, who gave her a mischievous grin.

 

“I admire women who take the initiative. Times are changing, and people need to realize there’s nothing shameful about a woman seeking out a man first.”

 

Moved by her boldness, the shopkeeper even shared Theodore’s home address. Though not the precise location, it was enough: a red-roofed house beyond the canal bridge leading from the central plaza.

 

Lisbell left the shop, the bell above the door jingling softly, feeling optimistic.

 

The weather was perfectly clear, without a cloud in sight. Her train to Kings Morgan Station had been free of trouble, and she had discovered Theodore’s residence by chance.

 

Pulling her top lower, she set off in the direction the shopkeeper had indicated.

 

The afternoon in Renbruck was serenely peaceful.

 

Basket girls sold flowers; boys with berets zipped around on bicycles delivering parcels. Couples strolled arm-in-arm, enjoying leisurely dates. A young man sat on a bench sketching pigeons.

 

The tranquil, refreshing atmosphere felt surreal. As if it were a world she could never truly belong to.

 

Not long ago, she had been trapped in a more luxurious mansion in the capital, a preserved trophy, like a specimen.

 

The thought of it still made her nauseous, so much so that she shuddered violently.

 

When she remembered the cruel man smiling at her, it felt as if winter, which had been slowly fading away due to early spring, had returned. A strange chill crept up her spine, making her pull her cape tighter, buttoning it fully.

 

The day was still relatively short.

 

After walking for a while, the street quickly darkened. Gas lamps lit up, casting a soft glow.

 

It was then that Lisbell entered a densely packed residential area. Thanks to the gas lights, it wasn’t difficult to find the red roof.

 

Standing at the door, Lisbell felt the tension she had nearly forgotten grip her insides, squeezing her stomach. She couldn’t believe she was so nervous now. Placing her hand over her heart, she exhaled, slowly trying to calm herself.

 

‘I’m just here to explain what I couldn’t say before and leave.’

 

‘Why am I so anxious over something so trivial?’

 

‘I’m not thinking of doing anything with him now.’

 

‘I know better than to try anything foolish.’

 

‘Then why do I feel like I want something so badly?’

 

Lisbell clenched her hands tightly, shaking her head to dismiss the thoughts. After a deep breath, she raised her small hand and knocked on the round door knocker, ensuring the sound reached inside. A soft voice responded from within.

 

“Yes?”

 

The familiar voice made her heart race in response. She felt the approach of someone coming to the door. Lisbell stood firm, gathering all her resolve.

 

“…Lisbell?”

 

But all her preparation was useless.

 

As the door opened, and she saw Theodore standing there, his face filled with disbelief upon seeing her, all the thoughts and emotions that had crossed her mind evaporated.

 

The overwhelming sensation that surged up was an intense longing—so strong that it was almost laughable to deny. It was as if the image she had so long imagined had become real, and she couldn’t stop herself from sinking into that feeling.

 

This was different from the descent she had felt before.

 

It was the fall of a hopeful sign.

 

“Theodore.”

 

She tried to smile, to appear cheerful.

 

When she saw him again, she didn’t want to bring up the painful memories from before. She had intended to give him a wide, bright smile.

 

But seeing Theodore, gazing at her with trembling eyes, made it difficult. Her voice cracked with emotion, and despite her best efforts to hold back tears, her mouth twisted in a way that betrayed her struggle.

 

“Lisbell… is it really you?”

 

Theodore, visibly shocked, seemed to struggle to believe it. He quickly stepped out and closed the door behind him.

 

“How did you get here…?”

 

“It’s… well, Theodore, that is…”

 

Her words came out awkwardly, mixed with shallow breaths, making it hard to speak.

 

Finally, Lisbell couldn’t hold back the tears any longer.

 

He had once been her fiancé, someone she had thought she would only ever encounter in dreams or memories. The person she had longed for, and though everything had shattered, she still held onto the precious memories.

 

“I came to talk to you.”

 

She didn’t care anymore.

 

No, she wasn’t here just to clear up misunderstandings.

 

Lisbell wanted to start over from the very beginning.

 

She wanted to apologize to Theodore, ask for his forgiveness, and rebuild the future she had thrown away with her own hands. She wanted to rebuild the bright future they had once dreamed of together.

 

She wouldn’t hide anything anymore.

 

Once, she had thought it was for his sake, but in the end, it was fear of being hurt that made her hide everything. Now, she would confess everything.

 

With him, Theodore, she believed it would be okay. She felt she could do it, to break free from his grasp, from the suffocating air that had oppressed her.

 

She only hoped it wasn’t too late.

 

Holding onto Theodore’s arm, Lisbell looked at him, hoping that some of the feelings they had shared still remained within him, even a drop.

 

“Theodore? What’s going on?”

 

Just then, a door behind them opened. A woman stepped into view, looking for Theodore.

 

Lisbell froze, her gaze slowly falling downward.

 

The woman had a noticeable baby bump.


‘Huh…?’ 

 

Lisbell doubted her own eyes.  

 

Her gaze darted from the woman’s rounded belly to her face, then back down again, only to rise once more. The erratic movement of her eyes betrayed the confusion she felt.  

 

“Jane.”  

 

Theodore turned around, seemingly startled to see her out there. Gently, he placed a protective hand on Jane’s shoulder. Lisbell’s eyes latched onto that gesture, unable to look away.  

 

“It’s still cold outside. Why did you come out?”  

 

“You weren’t coming back, so I got worried. But… who is this?”  

 

“Oh, this is…”  

 

Theodore glanced toward Lisbell. A moment ago, his gaze had been filled with warmth, but now it pricked like thorns. She could read the discomfort on his face as clearly as if it had been written there.  

 

In that moment, everything became painfully clear.  

 

The space beside Theodore was no longer empty. The relationship she had once hoped to restore had long since faded into the past. Theodore and Jane were deeply in love; anyone could see that. There was no place for her in their story now.  

 

No, there wasn’t.  

 

Her place by Theodore’s side no longer existed.  

 

“I-I’m sorry.”  

 

Lisbell staggered back a step, her face flushing with heat. She wasn’t sure what she was feeling.  

 

Shame? Embarrassment? Or perhaps… disappointment?  

 

The tangled mess of emotions left her dizzy, unable to sort through them. She only knew that she wanted to flee—right now, right away. To hide, to disappear into the smallest hole she could find.  

 

She wanted to vanish from this world.  

 

“Maybe I should… I mean, I’ll just…”  

 

What words could possibly fit this moment?  

 

None seemed right.  

 

Her very presence here felt like a mistake. She shouldn’t have come. Her decision to show up was nothing but selfishness. The raw, exposed truth of her motives made her want to shrink into herself.  

 

As she struggled to decide what to do, her eyes met Jane’s. That was enough to make her turn and run.  

 

She had felt it earlier—an ominous sense that today wasn’t going to end well.  

 

That feeling had solidified the moment she noticed Jane.  

 

Unfortunately, her hurried steps landed her in a puddle. She slipped and fell awkwardly, her knees hitting the ground hard. Pain shot up her legs as muddy water splashed everywhere, staining her clothes.  

 

A mess.  

 

Everything was a mess—her mood, her appearance.  

 

What made her feel most pathetic was knowing Theodore was still standing behind her, witnessing it all. His very presence turned her into the most pitiful figure in the world.  

 

“Lisbell!”  

 

She didn’t even want his kindness at that moment. She might have preferred him to ignore her entirely—it would’ve hurt less.  

 

But Theodore wasn’t like that. He never had been.  

 

He rushed to her side, kneeling in the mud without hesitation. The sight of his knee soaking in the muck made tears well up in her eyes.  

 

“Jane, could you go inside and bring a towel? Please.”  

 

“Alright.”  

 

She heard Jane’s footsteps retreating into the house. Lisbell pressed her trembling hands against the ground, biting her lip hard. Theodore’s hand gently rested on her shoulder.  

 

Her lips moved as though someone had nudged her.  

 

“I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. I shouldn’t have come. I’ll leave now. Right now.”  

 

“What? What are you saying? You can’t leave like this! Your clothes are soaked, and your knee looks hurt.”  

 

  

 

“Come inside for a moment. Wash up, change into dry clothes, and rest a bit before you go. You don’t look well at all. Lisbell, please, okay?”  

 

With his help, she slowly stood up.  

 

His touch was warm, just as it always had been. Even though they were no longer lovers, that warmth hadn’t faded. It weighed heavily on her heart, a bittersweet reminder of everything they’d shared.  

 

Theodore was a man who offered kindness to anyone, regardless of their relationship with him. Memories of how his gentleness had comforted her flooded her mind, making her chest ache.  

 

A dizzying sensation swelled within her. Lisbell knew this feeling all too well.  

 

It was the same despair she’d felt lying naked on Ulrich’s bed, staring up at a bright, blue sky that seemed so unattainably distant.  

 

The kind of shame that made her wish she could hang herself from that unreachable sky.  

 



 

“Drink this. It’ll help warm you up.”  

 

A gentle warmth spread through her hands. The soothing aroma of herbal tea wafted softly in the air.  

 

Lowering her gaze, Lisbell took a sip. The warmth spread through her mouth, and, as Theodore had said, her body temperature seemed to rise slightly. But the chill within her remained, as though an irreparable gap had been etched into her core—something no material comfort could fill.  

 

“Ah, as I thought. You’ve got a bruise.”  

 

It wasn’t until he spoke that Lisbell realized Theodore was kneeling in front of her, examining her injured knee. She opened her mouth, wanting to say she was fine or that he didn’t need to do this, but no sound came out. Her lips parted uselessly before sealing shut again, and her downcast expression hardened into a thin line.  

 

Meanwhile, Theodore had already finished applying ointment with his usual gentle touch.  

 

“If you need more towels, I’ll get some,” he offered.  

 

“No, it’s fine,” she replied softly.  

 

A brief silence followed. It felt as if tiny insects were crawling beneath her skin. Realizing the distance that now separated her from someone she had once been so close to filled her with a bone-deep unease.  

 

‘What happens now?’  

 

Would he leave the room, telling her to rest for a while? Or would he try to strike up a friendly conversation, as he used to? What was Theodore thinking? Was he, too, feeling the weight of this distance, recalling their once-precious moments as nothing more than a fleeting dream?  

 

“Do you have somewhere to stay tonight?”  

 

When he finally spoke, Lisbell felt like a foolish dreamer lost in pointless fantasies. Here he was, so grounded in reality, while she remained trapped in naive, wishful thinking. Bitterness filled her mouth.  

 

“How about staying here for the night? There’s a forecast for rain in the early morning. If you push yourself to leave in your current state, you might catch a bad cold. Lisbell, you’ve always been prone to getting sick when the seasons change.”  

 

“But staying here… it doesn’t feel right.”  

 

“Jane will understand.”  

 

Ah. There it was again—her name, spoken so casually from Theodore’s lips. His tone was neutral, unremarkable even, yet it sounded unbearably tender to Lisbell, as if he’d spoken it after holding honey on his tongue. The bitterness inside her turned coarse and raw, like swallowing a lump of sand.  

 

“So, it’s just the two of you living here?” she asked.  

 

“Yes. My parents used to stay here too, but when I brought Jane to live with me, they moved to company housing near the industrial district. I guess they thought it would be more comfortable for us this way.”  

 

“I see.”  

 

Though she responded dutifully, Theodore’s words barely registered. They flowed through one ear and out the other. As her mind drifted, Lisbell bit down hard on her tongue to regain focus.  

 

A soft laugh broke the silence. She looked up just as the bed dipped slightly under his weight. Theodore had sat down beside her.  

 

“Our conversation feels so detached, doesn’t it?”  

 

“What?”  

 

“To be honest, I was surprised. No, I’m still surprised. I never thought you’d come looking for me like this.”  

 

There was weight to his words—or perhaps it was Lisbell’s memories of him that twisted them into something heavier.  

 

Her hands curled into fists on her lap.  

 

“I’m sorry…”  

 

The wretched final moments of their relationship weren’t only vivid in Theodore’s mind—they haunted Lisbell too. It was that clarity, that painfully sharp memory, that had driven her to seek him out, determined to explain herself.  

 

That had been her purpose.  

 

But when she set out to see him, she hadn’t imagined this. She hadn’t foreseen another woman by his side—a woman who was pregnant, who already seemed to have built a life with him.  

 

At this moment, all Lisbell could offer was an apology. Anything more would only come across as a selfish attempt to plead her case.  

 

“I didn’t bring it up to hear an apology,” Theodore said. “I just… I never thought I’d see you again.”  

 

“I didn’t think I’d see you again either!”  

 

This time, the words burst out of her, unstoppable.  

 

“It might not mean much to you now, in any way, but I wanted to see you, Theodore. Just once more. That’s why I came.”  

 

He might think she was lying.  

 

He might grow angry, lash out.  

 

But it was the truth.  

 

This was her unfiltered, undiluted sincerity.  


But that was purely her perspective and will.

 

That was why she became afraid to see Theodore’s reaction.  

 

When she lacked the courage to face him directly, stubbornly staring ahead instead, she felt a soft, deflating laugh graze her ear once more.  

 

“After what happened between us…”  

 

Lisbell immediately realized what he was referring to. That day at Marnia’s villa, the day she had broken off their engagement.  

 

“It wasn’t long after I returned to Misley. When our engagement was called off, I was preparing to leave and return to Renbruck. My parents wanted that too. But just before leaving Misley, I went to the square for something I needed and met Jane for the first time. She was a traveler. She approached me to ask for directions.”  

 

  

 

“That was all there was to our first meeting. It was such a brief moment that we didn’t even have time to introduce ourselves. I thought that would be the end of it. But a few days later, I ran into her again at a tavern near the station. We recognized each other, naturally ended up sitting together, and started chatting. Surprisingly, our conversation flowed easily. We had similar tastes, and the more we talked, the more I lost track of time.”  

 

  

 

“At the time, I was living in a haze of sadness—something uncharacteristic of me. I had been sincere about our engagement. When that dream shattered, all I felt was loss and confusion. I wasn’t sure if going back to Renbruck was the right decision or if it was what I truly wanted. I was wandering aimlessly, you could say.”  

 

It didn’t take much to realize what he was saying. He mentioned going to a tavern. Theodore didn’t drink. For someone like him to set foot in a tavern was proof of how much he had been struggling.  

 

“Jane was the one who pulled me out of it.”  

 

  

 

“Jane was a traveler, moving from place to place, and her stories of her adventures were fascinating. At that time, her stories were the only comfort I had. I started visiting the tavern daily, not for the drinks—I barely touched alcohol—but just to see her.”  

 

Perhaps she and Theodore had endured the same period of time with similar emotions—wandering, lost in chaos.  

 

But for him, the solution hadn’t been her.  

 

“Then, a few days later, Jane told me about a city she had always wanted to visit. It was a modern city with advanced industrial technology, bustling with diverse and free-spirited people coming and going.”  

 

  

 

“Yes, Renbruck.”  

 

  

 

“When I heard her mention Renbruck, I couldn’t help but wonder if this was fate. I hadn’t told Jane that it was my hometown, not even once. So it felt even more remarkable.”  

 

Theodore smiled softly.  

 

It was a smile he wore while thinking of her—Jane.  

 

The woman who had resolved the anguish Lisbell had caused him.  

 

The woman he now believed was his destiny.  

 

“…I see.”  

 

Lisbell clenched her fists so tightly her knuckles trembled. Her nails bit into her palms, causing a sharp sting. She tried to keep her voice steady, but it was futile. Her vocal cords quivered pitifully. Biting down hard on her lips to keep them from trembling, she muttered under her breath.  

 

“I knew I shouldn’t have come…”  

 

“That’s not it, Lisbell.”  

 

  

 

“I told you this because I want you to feel at ease with me. I want you to know that I’m no longer clinging to our past.”  

 

Those words should have brought her relief. But instead, they brought a lingering sadness that wouldn’t leave her. It felt bittersweet. She was glad his wounds had healed, but there was a strange sorrow in knowing they no longer bound him to her. The conflicting emotions unsettled her spirit sharply.  

 

Part of her felt like sighing in resignation.  

 

He really hadn’t changed. Even now, when she had appeared without notice, he hadn’t questioned her reasons or her circumstances. Instead, he had shown understanding and even tried to comfort her. He had even spoken about something that must have been hard for him to share, all to reassure her.  

 

“…Then, I’ll stay just for today.”

 

‘And I’ll leave tomorrow.’ 

 

She didn’t bother saying it out loud.  

 

Theodore likely wished for it too, even if he hadn’t expressed it. After all, Jane was here. Lisbell hid her lingering bitterness behind a forced smile.  

 

She had a feeling that tonight would feel particularly long.  

 

  

 

As soon as she finished the meal Theodore brought her, she collapsed onto the bed and fell asleep. She hadn’t realized how exhausted she was from days of running, unable to get proper rest. The delayed fatigue hit her all at once.  

 

But her sleep wasn’t deep. Perhaps the anxiety coiled inside her heart wouldn’t let her rest fully. She tossed and turned before waking up in the middle of the night.  

 

When she opened her eyes again, a light drizzle was falling outside the window. She wanted to sleep until morning, but the sound of raindrops tapping against the glass kept her awake.  

 

Lisbell sat up and ran her fingers through her messy hair. Her fine strands were always sensitive to the weather, and the moisture in the air left her hair more tangled than usual.  

 

As she half-heartedly tried to smooth it out, she froze. She suddenly remembered someone who used to playfully bite at her tangled strands on such days, calling them “adorably stubborn”. 

 

Shaking lightly, Lisbell rose from the bed.  

 

That’s when she noticed the tray on the bedside table. It wasn’t the herbal tea Theodore had given her earlier to warm her up. He must have returned to her room after bringing her dinner. Lisbell sipped the tea, now completely cold.  

 

It was icy. So cold it chilled her to the bone. It felt as though the warmth she had managed to regain was sinking back to the floor. Lisbell quietly set the cup down.  

 

Perhaps it wasn’t just the coldness of the tea.  

 

It might be the disappointment, gnawing deeper into her heart and soul, that was the true culprit.  

 

Swallowing a sigh, Lisbell, now fully awake, opened the bedroom door carefully.  

 

The sound of the rain grew heavier as she stepped outside. The enveloping sound of water made her feel as if she were standing in the middle of the ocean.  

 

It was as if a tide was rising, slowly creeping from her toes to her calves, knees, and thighs, threatening to engulf her entirely.  

 

Lisbell stood before the window, letting the melancholy in her heart flow away with the gentle rhythm of the rain. She stood there, lost, like someone unsure of where to go.  

 

“Miss Osborne.”  

 

She flinched, startled, realizing someone had approached her in the dim light.  

 

Turning quickly, she saw Jane standing there—the same woman she had seen earlier. Lisbell froze, unsure how to respond, as Jane, cradling her rounded belly, walked forward with a serene smile.  

 

“You’re awake.”  

 

“Yes, I think I dozed off for a bit.”  

 

“Here.”  

 

Jane handed something to her.  

 

“These are the clothes you were wearing earlier. I had them laundered, but you were asleep, so I planned to give them to you tomorrow.”  

 

“Thank you.”  

 

Lisbell realized she was currently wearing Jane’s clothes, lent to her at Theodore’s suggestion. For some reason, this made her feel even more uncomfortable. She quickly took the clothes from Jane’s hands.  

 

“We haven’t even properly introduced ourselves yet, have we? I’m Jane Hince.”  

 

“Oh, Lisbell Osborne.”  

 

She shook Jane’s outstretched hand. It was just a handshake, yet she felt an inexplicable tightness in her chest. When she raised her head, her eyes met Jane’s, which were curved into a gentle smile.  

 

But there was something off about those eyes.  

 

They felt artificial, like a hollow shell devoid of any soul. Lisbell was sure she had felt this kind of unease before, though she couldn’t place when.  

 

“Lisbell… is it?”  

 

  

 

“Why are you here?”  

 

Shhh.  

 

The rain’s sound suddenly seemed to fade. The tension thickened.  

 

“…Pardon?”  

 

“I heard you were Theodore’s former fiancée. That you dragged things out only to rudely demand a breakup, claiming you no longer loved him.”  

 

  

 

“How could someone like that show up here so shamelessly? I’m genuinely curious.”  

 

Jane’s expression remained pristine, like an untouched snowy field. Her words, though sharp, carried no genuine malice. Yet, they struck a nerve.  

 

They called out the guilt Lisbell had been ignoring, forcing her to confront it.  

 

At the same time, they made her understand Jane’s perspective—the discomfort she must feel and the disdain she clearly harbored for Lisbell.  


It was something beyond doubt.  

 

She wasn’t just anyone, she was his former fiancée.  

 

The woman who had once been romantically involved with the biological father of the life growing inside Jane’s womb. The same woman who had unilaterally ended their relationship in a manner so inconsiderate it tarnished every memory they had built together.  

 

For Jane, there was no reason to look kindly upon Lisbell.  

 

Why had she only just realized this?  

 

If Jane were to drive her out of here right now, there wouldn’t be a single person who could fault her for it. Given their relationship and circumstances, Jane was the one who rightfully belonged at Theodore’s side. That legitimacy served as the foundation for Jane’s aversion to Lisbell.  

 

Even now, Jane gently stroked her stomach. It didn’t seem like a deliberate display but rather an unconscious act. Still, the sight gnawed relentlessly at Lisbell’s thoughts.  

 

It was already late. Far too late for a pregnant woman to be awake. In fact, it was too late for anyone to be awake.  

 

If Jane’s sleeplessness at this hour was solely because of Lisbell…  

 

“I-I’m sorry.”  

 

Lisbell took a hesitant step back, her face growing hot.  

 

The tangled threads of emotions that Theodore’s words had stirred within her gradually sank beneath the surface. What emerged instead was an acute awareness of her presence here, an overwhelming sense of shame for coming to a place where she clearly didn’t belong and imposing on everyone.  

 

It felt as though she had been handed an undeniable verdict: that her presence here was neither needed nor wanted. And it was Jane, Theodore’s partner, who had delivered that realization, making Lisbell’s pride crumble even further.  

 

“If my presence made you uncomfortable….”  

 

  

 

“No, if it upset you….”  

 

Her attempt at an apology was cut off by Jane’s calm, steady voice.  

 

“Why don’t you leave now?”  

 

Lisbell stared at her in a daze, forgetting even the heat rising to her cheeks.  

 

Jane’s expression hadn’t changed. There was no trace of hostility, nor was there any other discernible emotion. She appeared entirely devoid of feeling, as though she wasn’t capable of experiencing emotion in the first place.  

 

That wax-like stillness sent a chill through Lisbell. A peculiar sense of déjà vu that she couldn’t shake.  

 

It was as if she had seen this before, somewhere.  

 

For a brief moment, she racked her brain, but the answer eluded her. Lisbell couldn’t bear to look at Jane any longer and turned her head away.  

 

It was only then that Jane’s words fully registered.  

 

“You’d be better off returning to where you came from.”  

 

Perhaps Jane thought Lisbell hadn’t heard her, for she repeated herself with even more clarity.  

 

To where you came from.  

 

Even though Lisbell was certain Jane didn’t know the implications of her words, they still felt chilling. As if she were being cursed to return to the man who had turned her life into a ruin, desperate to grasp even the ashes that remained.  

 

Lisbell bit down hard on the inside of her cheek.  

 

Her despair in this moment was meaningless. Theodore had been kind enough to extend her some grace, and if Jane desired him, then leaving was the only right choice. In fact, she felt foolish for not reaching that conclusion sooner.  

 

Lisbell bowed deeply to Jane in apology. She returned to her room, changed, and packed her belongings. Her trembling hands dropped and fumbled with items several times, but she persisted until everything was in place. Then, she left Theodore’s residence.  

 

The door, which had been so difficult to approach and knock on, now opened far too easily as she exited.  

 

Pulling her hood tightly over her head, Lisbell retraced her steps back into the night. Without an umbrella, her body was quickly drenched by the rain, yet she found herself oddly numb to it.  

 

She walked along the dimly lit streets for about twenty minutes, passing a square before eventually reaching the distant silhouette of the train station.  

 

“Ha….”  

 

A breath escaped her lips, half a sigh, half a gasp, as she entered the station.  

 

Kings Morgan Station was nothing like it had been during the day. With no late-night trains running, the place was eerily empty. She had expected to see at least a few vagrants or drifters, but the station seemed to be meticulously maintained, with not a single soul in sight.  

 

For now, Lisbell found comfort in the silence.  

 

Having been driven out of a place where she had sought shelter, she felt like an unwelcome guest no matter where she went. In that sense, this desolate public space felt more tolerable.  

 

She decided to wait until dawn. When the first train began its morning run, she would leave.  

 

‘…But where?’  

 

Sitting on a bench, staring blankly ahead, Lisbell tilted her head back.  

 

The ceiling of the station, made of stone framework, came into view. Perhaps due to the rain, the sky was hidden. The clouds, the moon, the stars—nothing could be seen, and the surrounding darkness was overwhelming. It felt as if the darkness itself was peering into her mind.

 

‘Where am I supposed to go now?’

 

Her internal compass seemed lost, spinning in circles. The more she reflected on her own helpless situation, the more hopeless it became.

 

Occasionally, the breaths she exhaled turned into a bewildered laugh.

 

Why did it come to this?

 

The weak laughter that had started as a chuckle soon turned into sobs. Lisbell pulled her knees up onto the bench and hugged them close to her chest. She curled into herself, her body huddling so tightly that her forehead gently rested against her knees, gradually dampening with tears.

 

Yes, the truth is…

 

She had hoped, just a little.

 

She had hoped that there was still something she could turn back, that it wasn’t too late.

 

If she explained everything that had happened to her, kind Theodore would surely listen and eventually take her back into his arms.

 

She had to give up on her mother, but maybe, just maybe, her relationship with Theodore still had a chance.

 

Why had she never considered it for a single moment?

 

The assumption that Theodore might already have someone by his side.

 

Wasn’t it obvious? The hope she had been clinging to was blind. It wasn’t real hope but a base desire, nothing more.

 

“……!”

 

Suddenly, Lisbell’s shoulders jolted.

 

A pure, monotone sound echoed through the station, which seemed to be asleep. The silence was so intense that the sound struck her ears sharply.

 

She quickly located the source of the sound. It was a phone attached to the wall near the platform where the trains entered. It was for emergency use, where one could pay to call the station in case something urgent arose.

 

Right now, that phone was ringing.

 

The sound was loud enough to grab her attention, but it was only for a moment. Lisbell knew she had to decide where to go once morning came, before anything else. 

 

The world was vast, and there were places to go. However, they were mostly empty, lacking anyone who might remember her. Moving forward into a land where no one knew her seemed an impossible task. This was why she had tried to escape, defying her husband’s wish to go to Dukas. It had been the same reason.

 

While lost in thought, the ringing phone gradually faded into silence. In the sudden stillness that returned, Lisbell closed her eyes.

 

‘Are they still… looking for me?’

 

Moreover, this was not something that would be resolved simply by moving.  

 

Lisbell needed to be careful so she would never fall back into that man’s grasp. She might even have to abandon her former identity and completely transform herself into someone else, a risk she had never considered until now. The thought gave her a headache.

 

‘Why… why do I have to bear all of this?

 

Why can’t I be where I want to be…’

 

The unjustness rose up again, pressing heavily against her chest.

 

“Then, if you ever choose to become independent and start a new family, I want to remain a place where you can always come back to. Like a hometown, like a starting point.”

 

Her mother’s words suddenly came to mind, making her feel especially sorrowful today. When she thought about it, those words had almost seemed like a heartfelt will. Lisbell lowered her legs from her chest, grabbed the bag at her feet, and stood up.

 

At that moment, the phone in the distance rang once more. This time, she wasn’t as startled as before.  

 

Lisbell quickly opened the bag and reached to the bottom where her mother’s clothes were. It was a comforting gesture, one she had made many times before, but today it didn’t bring the comfort she had hoped for.

 

“This wrapping garment… didn’t it feel too tight for you, Mother?”

 

“I actually prefer it this way.”

 

Her mother always wore clothes that were so tight around her neck, shoulders, and limbs that it was almost suffocating. The clothes Lisbell was now handling weren’t much different from those. Her mother had once explained that it was due to her long years spent in a monastery, and this style of dress was more comfortable for her.

 

‘…A monastery?’

 

Lisbell’s hand suddenly stopped.


“Allante? Mother, what is Allante?”  

 

“It’s the name of a monastery where I once owed a debt before having you. In the world, it’s called St. Allante Monastery.”  

 

It was the name inscribed in elegant handwriting on the first page of her mother’s Bible—a Bible her mother had never abandoned, no matter how often they moved due to their difficult circumstances.  

 

St. Allante Monastery. Her mother had come from there.  

 

“A monastery…”  

 

Lisbell pulled her mother’s clothing into her lap.  

 

Whenever they spoke about it, her mother never seemed to regret being cast out from that place. She had accepted the consequences of her actions with quiet grace, likely shaped by the life she had led there.  

 

The church of Portly near Saint Laurent came to mind.  

 

It had snowed for the first time that year when Lisbell buried her mother there. The memory of leaving things unresolved still filled her with shame and frustration. Yet, at the time, there was nothing she could do but retreat quietly.  

 

Perhaps it was the monastery, not that lonely grave, where her mother should have been laid to rest.  

 

Wouldn’t that be the truest show of devotion a daughter could offer?  

 

It wasn’t too late. Her mother’s body may have been taken by that vile family, but she still had her mother’s clothes, almost like relics.  

 

If she could send her mother off properly, even in this small way, it would be enough.  

 

A clarity swept through her mind like a cleansing gust of wind. The scattered, chaotic thoughts that had clouded her judgment began to settle.  

 

She had a destination now.  

 

St. Allante Monastery.  

 

The rest could wait until she properly honored her mother’s memory.  

 

With her decision made, Lisbell neatly folded the clothes, packed them away, and closed her bag.  

 

She recalled her mother mentioning where the monastery was when she was younger. To get there, she’d need to cross the vast ocean. Even after changing trains several times, she’d eventually have to pass through a port.  

 

Renbruck, known as a leading industrial city due to its rapid industrialization, certainly had a port.  

 

She remembered something Theodore had mentioned once—about a port near a farm his father’s factory had a contract with. Occasionally, when his father took him to the farm, they would attend the auctions held at the port.  

 

Even if it wasn’t Renbruck, many cities in Rechem had ports. The seafaring routes that connected to other nations were vital for economic growth, enabling industrial development and strengthening local commerce. Rechem, which had grown into a prosperous nation, made full use of these functions.  

 

It didn’t matter which port she used—she just needed to leave.  

 

Lisbell stood from the bench, gripping her bag. She needed to find the quickest route. She turned toward the train station to check the schedules. Since she had to stay up all night anyway, she might as well make use of the time.  

 

But as her shoes hit the ground, a sound pierced her ears—the persistent ringing of a phone she had been ignoring.  

 

  

 

A strange unease settled over her.  

 

Lisbell froze, as if someone had grabbed her. Slowly, she turned her head toward the ringing phone.  

 

Now that she thought about it…  

 

“That phone… it’s not for receiving calls, is it?”  

 

Why had she only realized this now?  

 

The phone was clearly meant for outgoing calls, not incoming ones. Who would even try to call this phone, expecting someone to answer?  

 

Her suspicion turned into a chilling sensation in her gut, spreading like frost through her body.  

 

The ringing wouldn’t stop. It rang, paused, and rang again—a third time now. The sound seemed to beckon her, an unseen hand urging her to approach. The echoes of the ringing spread like toxic fog, filling the floor, shaking the air, and encircling the ceiling.  

 

What had seemed like a familiar noise moments ago now felt unbearably sharp, like a shattering sound in her ears.  

 

The world around her grew deafeningly chaotic.  

 

Now that she thought about it, the emptiness of the station was also peculiar. No matter how strictly law and order were maintained, could it really be possible for no one to be here? Especially on such a stormy night…  

 

It seemed more plausible that someone had deliberately driven everyone out to create this artificial stillness.  

 

If that were true… running away wasn’t the solution.  

 

The situation felt like a trap, leaving her with no choice but to answer the phone. Lisbell slowly moved toward the device. The ringing pierced her brain like a sharp needle. Nothing about the sound had actually changed. The decibel level remained constant, but her heartbeat grew slower and heavier. The tension twisted her chest, rising with each step.  

 

Before she knew it, she was standing in front of the phone. The saliva in her throat wouldn’t go down. As she picked up the receiver, the dizzying noise abruptly stopped. The receiver felt impossibly heavy, as though time itself dragged on as she raised it to her ear.  

 

— …….  

 

  

 

The line was connected, yet silence hung in the air. Neither Lisbell nor the person on the other end spoke. A razor-sharp silence lingered, slipping like a blade across a shared breath.  

 

Even without words, the presence on the other end was undeniable, vivid in her mind.  

 

— Hah….  

 

A low sigh scratched at her taut eardrums.  

 

The first sound.  

 

A blend of a lament and a sigh of relief, it marked the moment when time, which had seemed to stand still, began to flow again.  

 

Lisbell’s hand trembled as she gripped the receiver. As if he could see her trembling, a quiet chuckle echoed from the other side. It felt calculated, as though he’d timed the mockery he hid like a knife beneath his tongue.  

 

There was only one person who could be this cruel and venomous toward her.  

 

With just a sigh and a faint laugh, she could already identify him. She loathed her ability to recognize him so easily.  

 

— Lisbell.  

 

  

 

— I know you’re there.  

 

  

 

— How do you feel, playing this game of hide-and-seek with me?  

 

  

 

— Have you decided to keep quiet?  

 

His voice, dry and low as it filtered through the receiver, was even more provoking than if she’d heard it directly.  

 

Lisbell closed her eyes tightly, then opened them again.  

 

When she still didn’t respond, the man began speaking again, as if coaxing her with false gentleness.  

 

— Don’t do this. Do you know how much I’ve been waiting for this moment?  

 

  

 

— I can’t even remember the last time I heard your voice. If you’d just say my name with that cat-like voice of yours, I might lose myself entirely.  

 

  

 

— Stubborn as ever.  

 

He clicked his tongue, his tone playful. Lisbell bit the inside of her cheek hard enough to draw pain.  

 

To him, this was still a game.  

 

To her, each moment was a life-or-death struggle, a series of unbearable decisions. But to him, it was nothing more than a whim, a trivial indulgence. And that realization was pushing her pride into the suffocating depths of helplessness.  

 

— Fine, then. Just keep listening quietly.  

 

  

 

— I’m not fond of this situation, Lisbell. You see, I’m not accustomed to watching someone’s back as they leave.  

 

What did he mean by that?  

 

His words often left marks on her mind, searing like brands. Lisbell tried to brush them off, to let them pass. She even considered hanging up the phone. But she couldn’t. She felt as though invisible chains were tightening around her, her body growing rigid.  

 

This phone call was dragging out the memories she’d tried so hard to bury, forcing her to confront them one by one.  

 

— Still, since you’ve gone through the trouble of running, why don’t you try hiding well?  

 

  

 

— Not a single strand of hair in sight. Hide completely….  

 

Every word he spoke dripped with deliberate leisure, his tone overflowing with confidence. To her shock, he hung up first, ending the call with an air of dismissive ease.  

 

Lisbell lowered the receiver slowly as the disconnected tone buzzed faintly in her ear. Her hand finally dropped when lightning silently flashed through the station windows, illuminating everything in stark brightness. The burst of light seared her mind like blue bruises etched into her memory.  

 

The man knew where she was.  

 

She only had one thought in mind.

 

She had to escape.

 

Lisbell slammed the receiver down as if throwing it. Then she quickly turned her body. Grabbing the bag she had set aside, she tried to run toward the entrance of the station she had just passed through.

 

But before she could, another thunderclap struck.

 

This time, it came with sound.

 

Boom—

 

The noise sounded as if the world itself was collapsing, and it grabbed hold of Lisbell’s ankle.

 



 

What if… he was already here?

 

What if he was already set up outside, waiting for her? If that was the case, leaving now would be like willingly sticking her head into a beast’s den.

 

Her hurried steps faltered, and she stopped.

 

The cold sound of rain pierced through her body. Lisbell slowly released the inner cheek she had been biting, the tingling pain on her mucous membranes helping her regain some clarity.

 

She had to focus.

 

If the strange scene inside the station was something he had orchestrated, then it’s possible that his influence had already reached this station. That meant it was highly likely he was waiting outside, preparing for her to come out.

 

But if that were the case, why hadn’t he made a move?

 

If he had already made it this far, he could have simply forced his way in. There was no need to create a situation like this, with her on edge.

 

So maybe…

 

‘Perhaps he’s trying to exploit my fear.’

 

Lisbell absentmindedly touched her neck, then turned her head to look at the phone. If the line was open, she could still make a call from another location.

 

In other words, Ulrich might not have even arrived here yet.

 

And based on everything she had experienced so far, he often set up scenarios where she was thrown into a situation to see how she would react. If this were another such case… leaving the station right now would lead to reckless consequences.

 

Shivering, her hands feeling unnaturally cold, Lisbell took a few steps back. She had to leave through a different exit, not the main one.

 

She looked around.

 

To the left, there were stairs leading to the platform where the trains arrived. To the right…

 

‘…A coach depot.’

 

Given the industrial nature of the new city, a large amount of goods was transported into the city every day, not only through the distant harbor but also via the train station. Therefore, the station needed coaches to transport goods, and they were kept in the depot.

 

Lisbell quickly headed toward it.

 

Since this station didn’t operate late-night trains, the depot was dark and silent.

 

She could see the iron doors tightly shut in front of the coaches, preventing any light from coming through. Likely, someone would open the huge doors when it was time to start the trains, and then the goods would be delivered to their respective locations.

 

If she hid here, it might be possible to escape the station without needing to pass through the main exit.

 

Lisbell crouched low and moved between the coaches. Some were empty, while others were already loaded with goods. The latter had probably been delivered last night, but because it was too late, they were planning to deliver them early the next morning. If she wanted to escape quickly, she needed to pick a coach that was already loaded.

 

Luckily, the coaches with goods had tags clearly indicating the items and their delivery destinations. After inspecting them, she found a large wooden box covered with a black tarp—perfect for hiding.

 

Lisbell grunted as she climbed onto the back of the coach. She carefully shifted the box to one side, creating just enough space for her to hide inside. Curling up, she pulled her bag into her arms.

 

For now, she had to wait until dawn.

 

During that time, she might hear sounds from outside. Someone might be certain she was inside and come looking for her, Ulrich’s subordinates, or perhaps him in person.

 

Lisbell exhaled a shallow breath, suppressing the urge to make noise.

 

Despite the situation, an odd sleepiness began to creep over her. Perhaps it was a physiological defense mechanism, her body cooling down due to stress, triggering an overwhelming urge to sleep. They say that when trapped in a cold place, one often falls into a deep sleep.

 

Hoping that the quiet rain would mask her presence, Lisbell fell into a restless sleep, waking in between.

 

“…Damn. It’s been raining like crazy since dawn…”

 

“What’s with this rain since the morning…”

 

“Anyway, let’s head out right away. The weather’s been bad, so we’re already delayed more than expected.”

 

“Let’s do that. Be cautious, the roads are slippery.”

 

Clunk!

 

The cart suddenly shook violently.

 

Along with the vibration, the boxes that had been hiding her small body all shook at once, waking Lisbell up. The storage area, which had been pitch black, was now brightly lit, as if nothing had happened. She didn’t dare poke her head out, but it was clear that the iron door, which had been tightly shut, was now open.

 

As she had guessed, the cart she was hiding in began to move little by little. The smell of rain pouring in from the separate exit, not the one for regular traffic, grew stronger.

 

The mist created by the rain during the night had spread thickly around them.

 

After a short while, the cart, having left the station, disappeared into the fog.

 

How long had they been going?

 

The cart had been shaking for quite some time. Lisbell, who had been holding her breath, realized they had traveled a long distance and released the tension in her neck.

 

Rubbing the stiff part of her neck, she lifted the black tarp around her and peered out. Not seeing Kings Morgan station or the plaza around it, it seemed they had passed the busy main road.

 

Good, at least… she had gotten out of the station.

 

The world, stained with relief, was slightly slanted. It seemed they were climbing a hill.

 

She cleverly moved the boxes that had been hiding her body. Then, gripping the high railing to keep the goods from falling due to the cart’s vibrations, she stuck her head out.

 

Since the cart was climbing a hill, it wasn’t moving too fast. The moment when she had jumped off the train with Mrs. Altahart’s secretary came to mind. Lisbell squeezed her eyes shut and prepared to jump off the moving cart.

 

“Ugh…!”

 

She rolled to the side, but fortunately, only some dust stuck to her, and she wasn’t seriously injured. After a moment of catching her breath while lying on the ground, she stood up, clutching her bag tightly.

 

‘The harbor… Is it only the harbor?’

 

The train station would likely be under even stricter surveillance from now on. No matter how hard she tried, there were limits to escaping in such a confined place. She had to head to the harbor, which was much larger, more crowded, and difficult to track, with many ships arriving every day.

 

‘The farm is on the outskirts. And there should be a harbor nearby.’

 

It was still raining, and her vision was limited, but that was not an issue exclusive to her misfortune. The people chasing her, under Ulrich’s orders, were also experiencing reduced visibility, so she needed to keep moving steadily despite her current discomfort.

 

Lisbell slightly lifted the front part of the cloche she was wearing. The tilted brim blocked the rainwater flowing down her face, allowing her to see a bit ahead. She wiped away the rainwater that hadn’t yet fallen off her cheek.

 

Given the weather, it would be great to catch a ride, but… she couldn’t risk being caught, so for now…

 

As she looked around, something brightly colored caught her attention. A red roof, standing out even from a distance.

 

It was the very place she had set out from this morning—Theodore’s house.

 

Just seeing it made her heart ache. The more she remembered the conversations that had taken place there, the more it hurt.

 

She probably wouldn’t come back again.

 

There was no reason to return, no excuse to.

 

So this would likely be the last time she’d see it…

 

She regretted not leaving a short note.

 

Theodoree, who had no idea of what had happened early in the morning, would surely be shocked when he realized she was gone. With his delicate and kind nature, his mind would be filled with worries.

 

Lisbell bit her lip tightly, turning away. She barely managed to swallow the sob that threatened to rise in her throat.

 

Then, a small, bitter laugh escaped.

 

When had her feelings for him become so full of regret?

 

Gradually, the laugh subsided, and Lisbell took slow steps toward the direction of the farm.

 

She resisted the urge to turn around repeatedly.

 

Revisiting the wounds she had given him, recalling the words of the person who had been by his side, reflecting on them, and engraving them deep in her bones… This was the farewell that had required such relentless effort.


Lisbell arrived at the outskirts earlier than expected.

 

There had been a crisis along the way. Without an umbrella, she had ended up completely soaked like a drowned rat, and her body, which hadn’t gotten any proper rest during the night, couldn’t fight off the fatigue that clung to her in waves.

 

Though she had definitely left behind the city with its government buildings and shops, entering the barren wilderness left her feeling confused, not knowing which way to go. It felt as though she had lost her way.

 

She barely managed to find shelter under a large, rounded rock, beneath the wide, light green willow branches, when she spotted a cart slowly approaching in the distance.

 

Thinking it might be someone looking for her, she hid, but it turned out to be a regular hay cart. Once she realized that, she had an odd feeling. This cart might be heading toward the farm she was after.

 

So, taking advantage of the driver’s distracted moment, she stealthily climbed onto the back. How many times had she done this, sneaking a ride? Lisbell smiled wryly as she hid behind the haystacks piled high.

 

As expected, the cart smoothly headed toward the outskirts. During the journey, the rain that had fallen all morning stopped. When she saw the large fields stretching out before a farm, Lisbell quietly got off the cart.

 

The harbor was much closer to the farm than she had expected. Standing on the hill where she could see the farm, she could even spot the harbor in the distance—so close that it could almost be considered next door.

 

Even from here, the bustling atmosphere of the harbor surged toward her, waking her senses. The long pier, the ships docked there, the many merchants, and the rows of shops were visible.

 

The scale of the harbor was larger than she had anticipated.

 

In a corner, people had gathered in a noisy auction, shouting at the top of their lungs, while several sailors moved briskly between the large ships and the harbor in preparation for the imminent departure.

 

Above, the clear sky had opened up, and seagulls, with wings spread wide, flew freely. Cats with tricolor fur, drawn by the scent of fish, darted around nimbly.

 

The lively atmosphere, as bustling as a market, was certainly a perfect place for someone to hide.

 

Lisbell lowered the brim of her cloche, which she had previously lifted, and approached the harbor.

 

She was hoping to do something about her wet clothes and was fortunate to find a clothing shop among the row of stores. Although she wanted to change into a blouse and skirt, her purse was tight, so she decided to save as much as possible and only exchanged her cape for a new one.

 

Standing in front of a mirror, she lifted the cloche, but despite the hat, her hair, already a tangled mess, could not be salvaged. She tried to comb through it with her hands, but the more she touched it, the worse it got. Eventually, it became so tangled that she couldn’t even brush it properly. Lisbell sighed as she looked down at the mass of hair in her hands.

 

“Lisbell’s hair is just like the cotton blossoms I held back then.”

 

“Should I call it a cute feeling…?”

 

She couldn’t help but recall the actions of the man who had always touched, combed, and even bitten her hair, as if he really liked it.

 

When Theodore said those things, they had come across as warm as sunlight, but when Ulrich spoke them, they felt utterly ridiculous, turning into an offensive insult that left her feeling deeply displeased. Her face scrunched up, as though she had swallowed muddy water, and Lisbell hurriedly untangled her hair.

 

She quickly finished fixing her hair before anyone could notice and pulled her hat back on. Unlike before, this time she rolled her long hair into a neat coil inside the hat, tucking in the stray strands.

 

After a brief greeting, she stepped outside.

 

The afternoon light, gentle and slow like a breeze, streamed down from the clear sky after the rain. It was hard to imagine the violent storm and thunderclaps of the early morning.

 

The harbor was full of curious onlookers. Even those not intending to take a boat seemed to have come to see the lively atmosphere firsthand. Blending in among the crowd, Lisbell managed to buy a ticket for the boat heading toward the country with the monastery.

 

There were still two hours until departure.

 

To kill time, Lisbell went in search of a crowded tavern to grab a meal. The inside of the tavern was dim, relying only on a few lamps to light the space.

 

A few sailors in dark blue uniforms were gathered in one corner, playing darts, while some other customers were sitting opposite each other, puffing smoke from their cigarettes and playing poker, laughing.

 

Lisbell, sticking to the wall to avoid them, sat down at a table closer to the bar and ordered a simple meal and drink.

 

Lisbell had been worried about getting asked questions, but it seemed the staff had encountered travelers like her before and didn’t show much interest. From the way customers were ordering more food, it seemed there wasn’t much time to spare for single diners. This allowed Lisbell to breathe a sigh of relief.

 

Although she had no appetite, she forced herself to eat the ordered food. Occasionally, when the food got stuck in her throat, she washed it down with water.

 

Then, suddenly, she sensed movement at a table behind her, which startled her. Reining in her stomach, which had nearly turned over, Lisbell gripped the handle of her bag tightly. She was ready to leave the shop at a moment’s notice.

 

But luckily, it seemed they were customers of the harbor, as they loudly called the staff over to place their orders. Lisbell, who had been paying attention, subtly diverted her focus and continued eating her remaining food.

 

“Damn it. The sole of my shoe’s all soggy. I must’ve stepped into a puddle up ahead.”

 

“Should’ve been more careful.”

 

“Did I know this would happen? What am I supposed to do when the car can’t come this far in? Damn it, why is there such sudden street control? And with all that military force being mobilized.”

 

Lisbell’s brief sense of calm didn’t last. The fork she had been holding fell from her mouth. Her attention quietly shifted back to the table behind her.

 

“Seems like there’s some dispute among the high-ups, huh?”

 

“No, no. I heard they’re looking for a woman.”

 

“A woman?”

 

“Yes. I saw some soldiers grabbing the shoulders of every woman who passed by, checking their faces.”

 

The food that had gone down her throat seemed to twist in her stomach. Lisbell, trying to suppress her nausea, gulped down some cold water.

 

“What? Is that true? Ha, wow. If it is, they’re really wasting manpower! Which woman managed to sneak off with some bigwig’s back and run away?”

 

Lisbell wanted to observe the situation with the same detached amusement as them, but there was something unsettling that made it impossible for her to laugh. Instead of amusement, cold sweat began to trickle down her back.

 

Control. Soldiers. Women. Faces….

 

Lisbell calmly packed her bag and stood up.

 

“From the way they’re searching every shop like rats, maybe it’s true.”

 

“Do you think this shop might get a surprise inspection too?”

 

“Could be. I heard soldiers were right by the side of the shop.”

 

Her steps, which had been heading directly for the exit, stopped because of those words. Lisbell quietly watched the sailors at the entrance tossing colorful darts.

 

A moment later, through the open door, she saw a shadow moving, like the edge of a swamp, swaying. A sharp instinct hit the top of her head. The air felt ominous. She immediately turned her body and moved back toward the inner part of the shop, away from the entrance.

 

When she was about to open the warehouse door she had seen the staff go in and out of earlier, a commotion erupted behind her. While the shop had been noisy throughout, this felt different.

 

In fact, if you measured by sound, the shop had become eerily quiet.

 

She could sense all attention in the room focused in one direction, and it reached her even at the back of her head. As she turned to close the warehouse door, she caught a glimpse of the shopkeeper, who had been standing inside near the long bar, rushing toward the door while shouting, “What’s going on?!”

 

Click…

 

She quietly shut the door and turned the lock.

 

Her heart was pounding fiercely.

 

The frantic beats of her heart, no longer hidden by the rain, surged within her chest, tightening their grip. Lisbell leaned her forehead against the door, her expression pained. Her stomach had become so cold that she felt like the food she had just eaten might crawl back up her throat.

 

Please, please.

 

She silently prayed to the unseen force behind the door.

 

You have been indifferent to me until now. So please, just this once… Please, let me not be discovered. Hide me.

 

Her desperate plea went unanswered.

 

The sound of heavy footsteps entering the shop filled the air, like the approach of an inevitable despair.


The salty smell wafting from afar was revolting.

 

Was it the scent of the sea, the harbor, or perhaps… escape?

 

Ulrich’s lazily closed eyelids lifted. His pale grayish-blue irises, framed by elegant lashes, reflected the vast expanse of the sea stretched before him.

 

Perched on a wooden cargo crate, he stared at the distant horizon, looking like a man on the verge of dozing off. Everyone wandering around the controlled inner harbor stole a glance at him at least once.

 

It was inevitable. His appearance had a captivating pull that was hard to resist. His bespoke shirt and pants were tailored perfectly to his frame, but the lack of a tie and vest, with a few buttons casually undone, exuded a freedom that enhanced his mystique amid the balance of order and chaos.

 

Even his posture, gazing pensively at the horizon as though lost in deep thought, contributed to the allure. The crimson hues of the setting sun danced around him, enhancing his beauty. The undying brilliance of nature seemed to exist solely for him.

 

Faced with such radiance, Ulrich closed his eyes again.

 

Thump, thump, thump.

 

The pounding in his chest grew more intense.

 

This was a first—something entirely unfamiliar.

 

It wasn’t just this strange inner turmoil. His hands and toes tingled, as if swept by an electric current, and without realizing it, he kept clenching and unclenching his hands, while his toes fidgeted restlessly.

 

What was this?

 

He’d get her eventually.

 

She would inevitably fall into his hands, yet this inexplicable unease lingered, as if things wouldn’t go his way.

 

It was so close now.

 

The lead from Kings Morgan Station had long been acted upon, and the area was under control. Finding nothing there had expanded the search area to this harbor near the outskirts.

 

She would only have confided in Theodore Mortier, the one person she had deep ties with in this region. If she’d learned of his circumstances, she likely would have been unable to restrain herself and fled here.

 

Other than him, there was no other connection she could rely on in Renbruck. Thus, she would likely try to leave Renbruck, and to do so, she would have to pass through either the train station or the harbor.

 

If not caught at the station, she must be here.

 

And if not here, the next step would be to comb through all of Renbruck to find her. To prevent any interference, he had personally silenced his mother by acquiring the massive Pyrilleo Mines at an astronomical price.

 

Yet still, his nerves remained unsettled.

 



 

Ulrich reached into his pocket, retrieving a gold case. He opened it to pull out a cigarette, then clamped it between his lips. The sharp sound of the case snapping shut echoed unnaturally in the stillness around him.

 

He idly bit the cigarette, scanning the harbor bathed in the glow of the setting sun.

 

A slow smile spread across his lips.

 

Yes, the unexpected variable had been failing to catch her at the train station.

 

Lisbell Osborne had undoubtedly been present when the call connected. Ulrich had already pinpointed her location through his informant before arriving in Renbruck.

 

Kings Morgan Station didn’t operate at night, and he had planned to arrive before dawn. Naturally, she should’ve been in his grasp by now. But somehow, Lisbell had evaded the eyes stationed around the station and slipped away with unnerving composure.

 

“Like a frightened cat, sneaking so delicately…”

 

He tilted his head and chuckled softly, his tongue curling in amusement. He almost wanted to laugh out loud, clutching his stomach. The platinum-blond hair falling to one side glistened under the natural light.

 

“Young master.”

 

Victor, who had momentarily stepped away for urgent business, returned with a scowl. Ulrich immediately understood the source of his reaction.

 

“I’m not going to light it, so stop glaring at me like that.”

 



 

“I just needed something to bite on.”

 

It was an excuse, but Victor didn’t seem satisfied. He glanced around, checking the surroundings for reporters who might have followed them.

 

There was no need for such caution. Anyone intent on following would’ve already done so.

 

Amused by the unnecessary worry, Ulrich bit the tip of his cigarette.

 

The Ulrich family had a strict policy against smoking outdoors, fearing the risk of being photographed by reporters. Similarly, except for a light pre-meal drink, they refrained from consuming alcohol in public.

 

For a businessman, public image was everything. It played a significant role in securing large investments or being introduced to influential opportunities. In a society where every aspect of one’s behavior could ripple through the business world, appearances were managed with the utmost care.

 

And Ulrich had never once crossed that boundary before.

 

Yet now, unable to endure this brief waiting, he had taken out a cigarette. Victor glanced around the harbor with a heavy heart. Thanks to the well-placed bribes over time, Colonel Craxson had readily lent his troops within half a day of the request. The soldiers dressed in Rechem military uniforms wandering around the harbor, inspecting the faces of women, were the manpower mobilized for this operation.

 

“My stomach feels unsettled.”

 

“Excuse me? Your stomach? How so? Is it serious?”

 

Victor’s immediate reaction to the monotone remark was exaggerated.

 

“No…”

 

He felt uneasy. Uncomfortable.

 

Ulrich knew well that this wasn’t a physical ailment. That knowledge made him say no more, clenching the cigarette between his teeth. The bitter taste spreading across his tongue mirrored his inner turmoil.

 

Far off, the half-disc of the sun burned on the horizon. He had only looked away for a moment, but in that time, it had sunk a little further below.

 

Bit by bit. Slowly. Like an invasion. Like erosion.

 

Anxiety.

 

What was creeping into him, unsettling his core, was anxiety.

 

It had been so long since he last felt it that its presence was unfamiliar.

 

Anxiety. A sense of crisis. Restlessness. Fear.

 

When was the last time he’d endured the messy, clawing sensation of such emotions? Ironically, Ulrich’s life had been stripped of these feelings, and with them, the dynamic pleasures of existence had been lost at the root. On the other hand, now that the fierce throb of his heart was vividly resonating within him, he had no sense of how time was passing.

 

Every day since Lisbell had been taken from him had been like this.

 

Handling what needed to be handled, organizing what needed to be organized- somehow, today had arrived. He couldn’t even fathom how he had managed to gather information on Daphne Schwaben, annul the engagement with her, and leave a thread of leverage over his mother.

 

His memory of how he had come this far was blurred.

 

In the process, there had been no room to feel the boredom that had clung to his life like a shadow. He had simply been… busy.

 

Before meeting Lisbell, the years, weeks, days, minutes, and seconds had dragged on endlessly, filled with nothing but monotony. It was so dull that he had wondered if the thirty-year mark he had set as the goal for his life’s end might never arrive.

 

But for the past few days, it was as though his life had finally found its rhythm. Time, once incomprehensibly slow, had flown by unnoticed until today.

 

And all his desire centered on one thing.

 

How to bring her back to his side.

 

Truly…

 

When did it begin?

 

When had he stopped feeling the ennui that had so relentlessly eroded his life?

 

“Victor.”

 

“Yes?”

 

“Isn’t it blinding?”

 

“Excuse me? Oh, uh, yes. The sunset is bright.”

 

No.

 

That was not it, Victor.

 

Dropping his cigarette, he clasped his mouth and chuckled, unable to suppress it. A low, stifled laugh escaped him.

 

“I think I finally understand.”

 

“Understand what?”

 

The vivid red light of the sunset blanketed Ulrich’s azure eyes.

 

“You… have never loved someone, have you?”

 

Perhaps this is what you meant when you spoke of love.  

 

These past days, my mind, obsessively preoccupied to the point of suffocation, has plunged into the madness of incomprehension, and perhaps that’s why I’ve ended up like this.

 

But even that raised a question.

 

Why?

 

How can one person’s perspective change so completely, so suddenly?

 

The reality of an emotion I had never felt any fondness for now seems to clear my mind, leaving me strangely relieved. I had dismissed this sensation as petty and insignificant, but—

 

If not this, how else can I explain the sudden disappearance of the ennui that had long drawn me to the edge of death?

 

I must have been enjoying it all along.

 

This unease, this deep, overwhelming, and distasteful pounding, this urgency devoid of leisure.

 

Even if it’s a chilling experience, I must have been enjoying it.

 

If the light Lisbell always clung to, trusted, and relied upon is something akin to this sunset… or this realization that strikes so fiercely, so brilliantly, with a hope close to defiant resolve—

 

If this is what love is… 

 

Ulrich’s blue, no, crimson-stained eyes burned with an intense gleam. They seemed to blaze like a living inferno, magnificent and unstoppable.

“How far along is the search?”

 

Victor suddenly spoke up.

 

Ulrich, feigning calm, easily caught the impatience subtly laced in his tone.

 

He turned to look at his assistant, but the latter was solely focused on Captain Reagan, who had been assigned to oversee this search by the colonel’s orders. Even in his gaze, a hint of unease was evident… something rarely seen from Victor, who was typically unshakably composed.

 

Ulrich recalled the urgent message Victor had just received.

 

“We’ve completed the auction house and shipyard inspections and are now combing through the marketplace.”

 

“How much longer will it take?”

 

“If we find anything in the marketplace, it will end quickly. But if we don’t… we’ll have to move on to the ship area. If it comes to that, it’ll take significantly more time. Every hidden compartment on every vessel will need to be searched. It could take all night.”

 

Captain Reagan explained calmly, but Victor’s expression remained grim.

 

“Victor.”

 

“Yes.”

 

“What’s going on?”

 

“Excuse me?”

 

“There’s a problem, isn’t there?”

 

Victor’s face momentarily faltered, betraying him. It was clear that he could no longer hide the truth. Sighing, he approached Ulrich, who was seated on a wooden crate, and leaned down to whisper.

 

“A message came from the main house.”

 



 

“They’ve issued a summons.”

 

Ulrich’s thin lips curved faintly.

 

A summons?

 

Even during his time in Marnia, this had never happened. A summons was essentially a red alert, a move that reflected both desperation and urgency. That it was being issued now, in this critical moment when Lisbell Osborne was within reach, was a direct message from his mother about how critical the situation had become.

 

But still—a summons?

 

This was a power reserved exclusively for the head of the family, used only against traitors who posed a threat to the household. To invoke it now was a clear indication of how high the stakes were.

 

It was both a measure to protect herself and a declaration of intent to forcibly strip Ulrich of his authority. His mother was determined to prevent this encounter at any cost.

 

“…Ha.”

 

Leaning back, Ulrich exhaled deeply. The long-repressed urge to smoke crept up like a stubborn mold. Running his hand over his face, he looked every bit like a man on the verge of exhaustion. A wry, bitter smile slipped through his features, revealing hints of frustration and disdain.

 

“What should we do?”

 

“What’s the penalty for disobedience?”

 

“The hotel management rights.”

 

“How excessive. Who do you think built the hotel into what it is today?”

 

The Alstad Hotel was one of Ulrich’s crowning achievements. For her to threaten to confiscate it in order to stop him was absurd.

 

At this point, it was almost petty.

 

The situation reeked of stubborn pride—an unwillingness to let things spiral further but also a desperate attempt to salvage her own dignity, no matter how broken.

 

“If you want to defend the management rights, you’ll need to leave immediately.”

 



 

“Sir.”

 

Ulrich’s gaze shifted upward. A lone white seagull cried out as it soared toward the blazing sun, its flight resembling an act of self-sacrifice.

 

Such outdated rules.

 

He had never felt resentment toward the family’s ways before, but now they grated on him.

 

Yet, even so, Ulrich welcomed it.

 

The things that had once seemed hollow and emotionless were now shifting, taking on new meaning. It was all because of her. Lisbell.

 

This change was unfamiliar but exhilarating. He found himself curious—how far would this newfound sensation take him? A quiet, bittersweet desire stirred within him to keep her as an eternal mystery in his heart.

 

“You can’t lose this, sir. You poured everything into bringing the chain strategy from paper to reality.”

 

Victor, standing beside him, was worried solely about the hotel. But Ulrich’s thoughts were elsewhere.

 

He silently watched the soldiers led by Colonel Crackson scour the marketplace.

 

Even if they found her here and brought her back to the estate…

 

Would it solve anything?

 

No.

 

His mother, the pillar of the family, still stood unyielding. Even after shattering his engagement to the Schwaben family to demonstrate his lack of commitment to that relationship, his mother showed no signs of backing down.

 

Taking Lisbell to the estate would lead to the same cycle all over again.

 

“…It’ll just repeat itself.”

 

“In a similar, or perhaps even more maddening, manner.”

 

That was not the result he wanted. Returning with Lisbell under such circumstances would be akin to indulging in foolish stubbornness. It was a pointless endeavor—why initiate something when the outcome was already so predictable?

 

“…Sir?”

 

Victor raised his head to follow Ulrich, who had risen from the wooden crate.

 

Ulrich brushed back his hair, which swayed in the sea breeze. His eyes, fixed on the far-stretching ocean, had darkened to a deeper crimson hue than before.

 

“Call for a retreat.”

 

“Excuse me?”

 

“Let’s head back.”

 

Victor, momentarily stunned, quickly signaled to the captain. The captain, who had been observing the scene with quiet attention, gave simple hand signals to the subordinates standing farther away.

 

Even as this unfolded, Ulrich’s gaze remained locked on the marketplace, where soldiers in uniform bustled about.

 

If she’s there…

 

He wanted to rush over, grab her by the hair, and force her to crawl to him on all fours, sobbing that she’d never try to run again. He wanted to see her fragile, tearful vulnerability as she confessed how hard it had been for her during their time apart.

 

But he knew better than to expect such a sight.

 

She was the type of woman who, even with her resolve repeatedly shattered, always found new light to cling to and hope for. She reminded him of the riotous hues of a dramatic sunset—something that instinctively made him frown yet captivated him nonetheless.

 

His heart pounded relentlessly in his chest, an almost unpleasantly intense rhythm that wouldn’t subside. The thought of turning away from what might be the embodiment of all his whims left him deeply dissatisfied.

 

As he finally turned, he spoke to Victor.

 

“The shareholder rights I inherited from the late Gwen—how much are they worth?”

 

“…Pardon?”

 

“If combined with mine, how much would that make?”

 

“Uh… What? Sir, why are you suddenly—”

 

Victor, caught off guard, instinctively reached for his notebook but couldn’t hide his bewilderment.

 

Ulrich, masking his turbulent emotions with a faint smile, leaned closer and spoke softly to his perplexed aide.

 

“I’m asking how much ownership I need to remove my mother from her position as head of the family.”

 



 

“Hey! Over here!”

 

Bang!

 

Someone kicked the closed warehouse door. Although it wasn’t her body that was struck, Lisbell flinched as if she had been hit herself.

 

“What’s going on?”

 

“The door’s locked.”

 

“Won’t it open?”

 

“Locked from the inside. Someone seems to be holding it shut.”

 

The doorknob began to rattle violently.

 

Voices from outside shouted for the owner and demanded the key to be handed over immediately. The clamor on the other side of the door felt like whiplashes against her nerves. Lisbell, her heart pounding, mustered all her strength to hold the door.

 

Then, the doorknob jiggled. They must have brought the key.

 

No…

 

Lisbell’s eyes welled up with tears.

 

She couldn’t be caught so easily.

 

Frantically, she looked around and spotted a long rod lying in a corner of the warehouse. She quickly let go of the door and grabbed the rod, preparing to strike whoever entered.

 

Her hands, slick with nervous sweat, gripped the rod tightly as she waited. Then, suddenly, the commotion outside came to an abrupt halt.

 

“…What did you say?”

 

“I said retreat!”

 

“What are you talking about?”

 

“We’ve been ordered to withdraw!”

 

“Withdraw?”

 

“Yes!”

 

A small clicking sound of annoyance came from outside, followed by the shadow near the bottom of the door fading away. The heavy, sharp sounds of boots against the ground gradually grew distant.

 

Lisbell watched the scene in a daze, her breath caught in her throat.

 

When the last signs of movement around the door finally disappeared, her trembling hands dropped to her sides.

 

The rod she had been clutching like a lifeline slipped from her grip and rolled into the corner.

 

They were gone…


He just left.

Without opening this door, he simply, simply backed away.

The blood that seemed to have completely drained out through the soles of her feet now finally filled her veins again, as if restoring her once-cold body temperature. Sitting on the spot, Lisbell panted, taking deep breaths.

Tears, which had welled up on her powerless eyelids, streamed down her cheeks.

A beam of light stretched across the narrow storage room. Lisbell followed it with her eyes. Forgotten sunlight shone vividly, as if to restore the warmth of the self she thought had been shattered and broken into pieces.

Rubbing her dazed face with her arm, Lisbell clutched her still-heaving chest, trembling with the aftermath. Taking a deep breath, she placed her hands on the floor to stand up. Grabbing her luggage, she unlocked the door handle.

Carrying the tension that prickled at her throat, she cautiously stepped outside.

As expected, the earlier search commotion had become a hot topic, with people gathered in small groups, chatting animatedly. Fortunately, since the soldiers had searched various shops simultaneously, there wasn’t much attention on this particular storage room. Using their indifference as cover, Lisbell quickly slipped out of the tavern.

Confirming that the group of soldiers in uniform was retreating in the distance, she pulled her hat down low and moved in the opposite direction.

After having a close call with danger, she could no longer roam the shops comfortably. She lingered in the back alleys and corners of the marketplace, enduring until the time for boarding arrived.

Finally, a distant, deep booooom of a ship’s horn echoed.

Oddly enough, there were no further disturbances. The ship, now fully prepared, pulled up its anchor from the depths and spread its white sails wide.

“Departure!”

The booming voice of someone giving the command was accompanied by a whistle that seemed to pierce the heavens. Lisbell watched the gradually receding port of Lenbruck with a gaze filled with suffocating silence.



Saint Alante Monastery was nestled amidst a breathtaking landscape, surrounded by cliffs with endless waterfalls cascading down their rugged faces.

In the age of chaos and disorder marked by ceaseless bloodshed from war, this magnificent cliff had served as a sanctuary for treating patients and hiding people, eventually leading to victory in a long, brutal conflict. It was a place whose sanctity and divinity were proven through history.

The inner chapel, reached after passing through a long corridor, was a cruciform dome carved and modified from rock. Its ornate mosaics and marble decorations along the edges were an indescribable spectacle.

“Miss Osborne, this way.”

Someone called out to Lisbell, who was mesmerized by the serene atmosphere of the chapel, momentarily lost in thought.

Snapping back to reality, she quickly followed the voice.

Since escaping the clutches of Ulrich, divine mercy seemed to have taken a faint hold of her, as things were going surprisingly smoothly.

When she first arrived at the monastery, she was filled with uncertainty. Her mother had lived here, but Lisbell herself had no prior connection to this place.

To come uninvited and ask for help in commemorating her mother’s well-being seemed quite audacious. Even so, clutching guilt and responsibility in either hand, she had barely managed to mention her mother’s name.

Lisbell had even resolved to write to the abbot if direct access was denied. Therefore, being led into the monastery’s premises now felt surreal.

Perhaps it was fortunate that the priest she met at the entrance had been familiar with her mother’s name. At first, there was no reaction to Lisbell Osborne’s introduction. However, upon hearing the name “Helen Osborne” who had once been a nun here, his expression changed subtly, then quickly turned to one of surprise.

“Please wait a moment.”

Politely excusing himself, he had left and returned shortly, informing her that someone wanted to meet her and guiding her into the monastery. It became immediately clear that this was due to traces of her mother’s connection to the place.

“Darien, I’ve brought her.”

The room they arrived at was a small reception room.

The priest stepped aside to let her enter. Lisbell’s gaze naturally shifted to the interior of the reception room.

A person dressed in a white monastic robe with a soft sky-blue veil and a long gold cross hanging from their neck rose slowly to face her. It was clear from their appearance that they were members of the clergy.

“This is Darien, the vice abbot of our monastery.”

The priest explained in a hushed voice. Unsure of how to act, Lisbell hesitated before bowing deeply.

Darien’s calm gaze examined her face intently.

“You look just like Helen.”



“There’s no need to ask further questions.”

Gesturing to the priest with his eyes, Darien motioned to the seat across from him. Lisbell approached and sat down, the sound of the door closing behind the departing priest echoing softly.

The now-silent reception room felt awkwardly still.

That tranquility suddenly felt ominous. While it was true that her mother had once resided here, she had left the place in disgrace after conceiving Lisbell.

After abandoning her aspiration to become a devout servant of God and returning as an apostate, it is uncertain what kind of impression her decision left on the people of this monastery.

If they viewed it negatively…

“…Is Helen doing well?”

Lisbell, who had been staring at the floor uncertainly, suddenly raised her head. She immediately noticed the warmth in Darien’s eyes, akin to the gentle sunlight of spring.

That expression felt as if it reassured her that her decision to come here had been the right one, melting away the tension that had built up within her. Lisbell, her eyes reddened, quickly reached to wipe her face, almost fumbling.

“Well… my mother… passed away recently.”

Her fingers, gripping her luggage, curled inward. Darien was momentarily at a loss for words, then cautiously asked:

“…What happened? Was it an accident?”

“No, it was an illness.”

“I see…”

“Well, that’s part of the reason I came here with a request.”

“A request?”

“Would it be possible to hold my mother’s funeral here?”

“Her funeral hasn’t been held yet?”

“Due to circumstances, we couldn’t conduct the service. And as for her remains… they’re buried in a church near the capital of Rechem.”

“Then why…?”

It seemed he didn’t understand why she was requesting a funeral when the body was already interred.

“I don’t want that place to become the site for remembering my mother. She… didn’t stay in the capital by choice. And I couldn’t properly care for her in her final moments.”



“While she lived with me, my mother often talked about this monastery. She always spoke with such joy and happiness, as though her memories here were incredibly precious. Even though she had to leave because of me, I believe she always carried a longing for this place in her heart.”



“So this place came to mind. If my mother could rest here, I think I, too, would find some peace of mind. I don’t need a grand ceremony for the funeral. A small grave where I can remember her would be enough.”

Lisbell spoke with a voice heavy with tension, barely holding herself together.

“I don’t have her remains to inter, but I do have some personal belongings she left behind.”



“Would that… not be enough?”

Darien, who had remained silent for a while, finally rose from his seat.

“Would you come with me for a moment?”

He led her to a cemetery hidden in the shadow of a sheer cliff, picturesque as if painted.

“This place was once a field hospital during the war. Countless lives lost meaninglessly to the bloodshed of battle were buried here.”



“Now, only those officially affiliated with the monastery or directly connected to its internal affairs may be buried here. That means creating a grave for Helen would be a difficult task.”

So, it was a rejection after all.

Then her attempt at atonement was also…

Her head, heavy with despair, began to droop. But Darien’s next words jolted her back to attention.

“However… I will make it happen.”


“…What?”

Lisbell couldn’t hide her surprise at the unexpected conclusion. Seeing her astonishment, Darien offered a faint smile, as if he completely understood her reaction.

“Helen and I joined the monastery at the same time. On a stormy day, with heavy rain and snow, the two of us were left in baskets at the entrance to this monastery. Perhaps because we were both orphans, knowing neither our parents nor our origins, I’ve always thought of her as my own sister.”

Darien, who had been kneeling in front of a gravestone, slowly stood and turned to face Lisbell. His expression carried the same gentle warmth her mother always showed when reminiscing about the monastery.

“Even though Helen left this place with a child, it doesn’t change how I feel about her.”



“When you walked into the chapel earlier, I felt as though I was seeing a younger version of Helen. I never thought I’d experience such a moment again in my life. It felt like an unexpected, precious gift. Turning you away would leave me with an unforgettable burden.”

“…Is it really possible? Even without my mother’s remains?”

“As I mentioned earlier, this place was once a battlefield. Many of those buried here were interred not with intact remains but with mementos such as dog tags or other belongings, as their bodies were too damaged or missing.”



“If you have Helen’s belongings, that will suffice. The merciful God understands and watches over everything, no matter how it is done.”

A wave of warmth surged through her chest. The knot that had been tied so tightly within her finally began to loosen, as if breaking free. It was a burden that might have weighed on her for the rest of her life if not for this moment.

“Thank you… truly, thank you so much.”

Lisbell bowed deeply, repeatedly expressing her gratitude. Darien lightly patted her shoulder in reassurance.

“Come to think of it, we haven’t introduced ourselves properly. I’m Darien Faye. And you are…?”

“I’m Lisbell Osborne.”

“Osborne.”

Darien repeated the surname, inherited from her mother, with a voice full of vivid nostalgia. Lisbell quickly wiped away her tears with the back of her hand, letting out a deep breath of relief.

Here, it was okay.

She felt she could finally let her mother go in peace.



Darien took charge of all the preparations necessary for the funeral. Thanks to his position as a sub-prior, he managed to streamline many of the formalities that might otherwise have been difficult.

As he had mentioned, Helen wasn’t an officially recognized member of the monastery anymore, so Lisbell had to remain discreet to avoid drawing unnecessary attention.

“Lisbell.”

Standing by the window, gazing at the picturesque view, Lisbell turned at the sound of her name. Darien was standing there, holding a tray of food.

“Am I interrupting your thoughts?”

“No, it’s fine.”

In truth, she had been anxiously watching the horizon, unable to shake the unease that had risen with the morning sun.

It felt as if the monstrous man who haunted her thoughts might storm into the monastery at any moment. But knowing that he would have to cross a vast ocean to reach her eased her fear slightly.

With her mind somewhat calmed, Lisbell clumsily voiced a question that had been buried deep within her amidst the chaos.

“They’ve issued an order to retreat.”

“Retreat?”

The men who had stormed the harbor that day were undoubtedly Ulrich’s soldiers. They had scoured every corner, searching for a woman, blocking roads and rummaging through the marketplace. There was no question they were acting under his orders.

But why the sudden withdrawal?

Whatever the reason, it must have been dictated by Ulrich himself. Perhaps he had decided to give up on finding her. Or maybe something else had happened.

Not knowing what led to her narrow escape frustrated her. While she was lost in thought, Darien appeared.

When she tried to take the tray from him, Darien shook his head and gestured toward the table instead.

“Did you sleep well last night?”

“Yes, very much so. It’s so peaceful here.”

“Being far from the city, it’s naturally quieter.”

“I didn’t expect you to give me a room to stay in. Thank you for your kindness.”

Darien smiled softly as he uncovered the dishes on the tray.

“This room was the one Helen used during her time as a nun.”

“Oh, so it was my mother’s…”

“The lack of new entrants last quarter may be part of the reason, but I’ve also been selfishly trying to keep this room vacant as much as possible. This place holds so many memories for me.”

It was clear that Darien had no problem letting someone stay here for a night, and even more so if that someone was Helen’s daughter, a sharer of those precious memories.

Whenever Lisbell sensed Darien’s goodwill toward her, a quiet warmth spread through her chest.

There was no hidden agenda or malice in Darien’s demeanor, which eased Lisbell’s wariness.

Yet, every time she faced this unfamiliar kindness, something surged up from her core—a hot and aching lump. Lisbell recognized it as the rare warmth of human connection, something she hadn’t felt in a long time. It reminded her of the uncalculated care and generosity she once took for granted when she was with her mother or Theodore.

Indeed, distancing herself from that man had been the right decision.

Only after losing him had she begun to regain what she had unwittingly forfeited. Slowly but surely, the ordinary, everyday moments of life that his suffocating presence had eroded were returning.

She hoped that these fragile fragments of normalcy would continue uninterrupted.

“After breakfast, let’s head to the cemetery together,” Darien said.

“Is everything ready?”

“Yes. Given the circumstances, only another priest and I will be present. It will be a quiet farewell.”

That was more than enough. The thought of finally being able to pray for her mother’s peace filled Lisbell with resolve as she picked up her cutlery.

After breakfast, Lisbell followed Darien to the cemetery. In a discreet corner where no one would notice, a new gravestone and a small burial pit had been prepared.

“Darien,” called a priest, who had previously guided Lisbell into the monastery grounds. He was holding a rectangular wooden box, and Lisbell immediately knew that it contained her mother’s belongings, which she had entrusted to Darien.

The funeral proceeded simply, with only the two clergy members.

After the box was placed in the ground, soil was gently shoveled over it, filling the pit. A few drops of holy water were sprinkled over the pristine gravestone. The water trickled down, soaking into the earth below. Darien closed his eyes and recited a prayer, pledging peace and farewell.

Unlike the one-sided goodbye at the Portley Church, this truly felt like a proper farewell for her mother.

Yet, as Lisbell watched the process, a complex emotion overcame her.

She felt a lightness, as if a burden she had carried for so long had finally been lifted, but there was also a deep sorrow. It struck her that this was the process of truly becoming alone.

Even though her guilt had been a heavy weight, it had also been a strange source of comfort—keeping her mother alive in her thoughts.

But now, with everything laid to rest, she realized that neither Theodore nor her mother remained by her side.

She was alone.

Completely and utterly alone.

Being alone meant being treated as an outsider no matter where she went. That was what her life would be from now on. Though she hadn’t yet faced such a situation directly, the thought of becoming a solitary wanderer left her feeling hollow.

“Where will you go now? Back to your hometown?”

It was as if Darien had sensed her loneliness. Lisbell hesitated before slowly shaking her head.

“No. I’m not going back to Reckem.”

“Then…?”

“…I don’t know.”



“Where should I go?”

Darien’s expression turned curious. She didn’t know the full story, so it was natural for her to find Lisbell’s aimlessness odd.

But Lisbell truly felt lost. She muttered almost as if she were leaning on the God she believed in.

“There was someone I loved… but I hurt him deeply, and we parted ways. My mother is no longer here either.”



“So… I don’t even know what’s left for me anymore.”

“…Lisbell. Do you have nowhere to go?”

Lisbell blinked slowly, her eyelids trembling with a dull ache each time they closed.

She felt relief, but also unease.

Everyone said the world was vast, but that didn’t seem to apply to her.

Why was it that she had nowhere to go?

“If that’s the case, have you ever considered joining the monastery?”

“…What?”

“As a nun, here in this monastery.”

For a moment, she thought it was just an impulsive suggestion meant to console her. But when their eyes met, she saw that Darien’s offer was genuine. Her gaze locked with his steady, unyielding eyes, and she spoke without thinking.

“…How much can religion truly protect me?”


“What do you mean by ‘protect’?”

“I mean, if someone tried to forcibly take me away from here, would it be possible to stop them?”

A profound expression crossed Darian’s face as she studied Lisbell’s features, as though trying to discern the underlying unease behind her words.

“…I’m not entirely sure what specific situation you’re referring to, but once someone is admitted into the monastery, they’re protected by the vow of lifelong devotion. Unless they choose to break that vow or renounce their faith, no one can easily interfere with them. It’s akin to a religious oath. In this country, such autonomy is inviolable.”

Before meeting him, Lisbell had lived in a world where such protections seemed a given. A world where rights weren’t so easily crushed by wealth, family influence, or power.

But… the world she had known and this place were different.

Religion, after all, was not a system dictated solely by capital. It was a sanctuary of miracles and divine intervention, a refuge where even the unsolvable brought people crawling to their knees before God.

Lisbell reflected on the incident at the harbor marketplace.

When the soldiers had stormed in for an unexpected inspection, only to leave without opening the locked warehouse, she had felt a deep relief. It was as if a slender thread of salvation had come from the very God who had always seemed to turn a blind eye to her.

Perhaps the man’s unpredictable change of behavior back then was divine intervention. Or maybe the capriciousness itself had been God’s hand at work.

What was certain was that whatever light had guided her through those moments had also brought her safely to this place. The warmth of that sensation was so sweet that it tempted her into thinking that maybe this was destiny—a comforting delusion of causality.

After all, if not here, where else could she go?

Even Darian’s current attitude seemed like a stroke of fortune. The way she so readily offered Lisbell a safe haven for no reason other than her connection to her mother wasn’t something to take lightly.

Lisbell wanted to surrender herself to that warmth.

Here, with Darian and in this place that finally let her feel the kindness of humanity again after so long…

Perhaps even this was a testament to God’s mercy.

A sign that He would no longer turn away from her.

How many times had she been crushed, tormented, and imprisoned under the man’s cruel whims, desperately praying for a God who might save her? If this was the fulfillment of that longing, Lisbell could not bring herself to refuse it.

“Could you give me some time to think about it?”

It was a decision that required careful consideration—whether to bind herself to religion for the rest of her life. Darian, seemingly not expecting an immediate answer, nodded in understanding.

Yet, by the time Lisbell returned to her room that evening, she had already made her choice.

For others, the life of a cloistered monk might seem stifling, but for her, that very confinement was a necessity. The restricted scope of movement and the sanctuary’s inviolability would serve as a protective shield.

That night, Lisbell borrowed a pair of scissors from a priest. Standing in front of the mirror, she cut off her waist-length hair. The wavy strands of gray tumbled to the floor, scattering like brittle leaves.

She thought of it as a symbolic act—a ritual of sorts. A way to sever herself from the monster that had thrived on her despair, leaving only its remnants behind.

A silent prayer accompanied the act, a desperate plea for the monster to be sated and finally leave her.



“Bell! Here you are!”

She was staring at the large cross mounted on the altar when she heard the familiar voice, accompanied by the sound of the chapel door opening and closing.

Lisbell turned her gaze toward the speaker, unclasping her hands as she did. Standing there, smiling warmly, was a woman about her age dressed in the same attire—a fellow nun named Delilah who had joined the monastery last quarter.

“Was it your turn to clean the chapel today?”

When pledging herself to the monastery, Lisbell had been given the option to choose a name. Most chose a baptismal name instead of their given name, and Lisbell had done the same. “Bell” was the baptismal name she had received through Darian. Perhaps because it was derived from the latter part of her original name, it didn’t feel unfamiliar.

“No, it’s Sonya’s turn.”

At Lisbell’s reply, Delilah narrowed her eyes knowingly.

“So you just came here on your own again? I wondered where you disappeared to right after lunch. Do you like the chapel that much?”

Lisbell smiled faintly and walked toward Delilah, glancing back at the altar.

The cross, adorned with a few unwavering candles, reflected refracted light, giving it a soft glow.

Ever since she had stumbled upon this sight, Lisbell had found herself returning to the chapel whenever she had time.

Unlike Delilah or Sonya, her circumstances were different. The silent unease planted within her churned in her stomach like dark, turbulent waters.

But whenever she sat in the calming atmosphere of the chapel and gazed at the large cross, she felt a semblance of peace returning, as though the chaos within her was soothed.

And though that solace was fleeting, it was solace nonetheless.

「To live as one consecrated to God alone.」

Before entering the monastery, the petition vow handed to her by the priest contained that phrase.

Celibacy.

While the term could be open to interpretation depending on the context, Lisbell immediately grasped what it meant in the monastery’s expectations.

It signified a body that had not lost its purity.

The formation process leading up to the lifelong vow was meant to shape an individual into a devout servant of God.

Thus, any external sexual stimuli were strictly denied and deemed corrupt. Lisbell’s mother had been exiled for violating this principle, hadn’t she?

After a brief hesitation, Lisbell signed the document as if nothing were wrong. Almost involuntarily, her mind vehemently rejected the implication.

It was assault. What I lost wasn’t purity but autonomy.

The act with Ulrich wasn’t something that could ever be called intimacy or lovemaking. To attach such words to it felt like a profanation in itself.

She could not, would not, accept that she was defiled by that act. When her thoughts reached that point, it was almost out of sheer defiance that she completed her signature. Matters of such physical nature were deeply private, and as long as she kept silent, no one would find out. With nowhere else to go, Lisbell clung to this loophole to remain in the monastery.

Yet she couldn’t completely ignore the discomfort weighing on her heart.

This was, after all, a promise to God.

The thought that her falsehood might one day be exposed and lead to her being mercilessly cast out haunted her relentlessly.

For that reason, she found herself drawn to the chapel whenever she had the chance. She would stare at the cross, seeking solace and subtly confessing her inner turmoil. It was less a confession and more a self-justification—a desperate bid to ease her conscience. Without such acts, she feared she would be consumed by guilt and despair.

“Let’s go. The afternoon schedule is about to begin.”

Delilah’s voice brought her back to reality. Nodding, Lisbell tore her gaze from the cross and followed her.

“Today, we’re in charge of cleaning the common room.”

Life in the monastery was divided into two main aspects: adapting to the communal environment and studying religious doctrine.

The former required rigorous education in cooperation and responsibility, as living together necessitated shared duties. Cleaning and maintaining the monastery grounds fell into this category. Yesterday, Lisbell and Sonya had spent the morning washing all the bedding from their dormitory.

“Aren’t you coming?”

Although Delilah mentioned the common room, her steps didn’t lead in that direction, prompting Lisbell to react with curiosity. Delilah, who had paused to admire the blossoming white fringe trees heralding spring, shrugged her shoulders.

“They said a guest is visiting today. I thought we should take our time since they might not be finished yet.”

“A guest?”

“Sir Philip.”

Lisbell tilted her head at the mention of the name as she inhaled the faint fragrance of the tree branch Delilah had handed her.

“Sir Philip? Didn’t he visit just last week?”

Seemingly understanding her confusion, Delilah replied in a matter-of-fact tone.

“Yes. Bell, you wouldn’t know this since you’re new, but Sir Philip is a frequent guest here. His family has been devout for generations, and they make substantial donations to the monastery every quarter. He’s practically a treasured patron here.”

Delilah added that such a distinguished guest’s visit shouldn’t be disturbed. Though her explanation was thorough, it didn’t entirely satisfy Lisbell’s curiosity. Something still felt unclear.

“But today isn’t even a day for regular worship,” Lisbell remarked.

What business could an external guest have at the monastery on a non-worship day? Sir Philip’s reason for visiting remained a mystery.

Delilah sighed lightly before continuing.

“He’s here to receive prayers from the priest. Or sometimes to offer them himself.”

“Prayers…?”

“Sir Philip has a young daughter who’s been battling a congenital illness since birth.”

 It was an unexpected story, and it surprised her a little.

“Oh, his daughter…”

“Yes, we only found out recently. From what I heard, the family doctor gave her a terminal diagnosis a long time ago, but Sir Philip’s daughter has lived far beyond the life expectancy the doctor mentioned at the time.”



“Sir Philip seems to consider it a blessing from God, which is why he’s been visiting more frequently than before.”

Lisbell understood. Few people could empathize with the pain of a family’s suffering better than she could. She had carried the burden of guilt and responsibility like a stain ingrained in her, unable to let go of it, which had led her to this place. She could completely relate to Sir Philip’s desperate efforts, even to the point of seeking solace in religion.

“Shall we head out now?”

Brushing aside the cluster of white petals that had fallen from the tree branch, Delilah turned toward the common room. When the two of them arrived, the timing seemed perfect, as the door that had been closed moments earlier opened just as they reached it. Straightening her posture and bowing her head, Delilah greeted the departing figures. Lisbell followed suit beside her.

Trailing behind Darian, a stranger’s face caught Lisbell’s eye.

Tall, with a thin and wiry frame. His lips carried a gentle smile, but his complexion was shrouded in a subtle gloom that seeped into every corner of his demeanor. Despite his somber aura, his attire was strikingly elegant and refined.

Lisbell instantly recognized him as Sir Philip, the man with a sickly daughter.

“What brings you here?” Darian asked, turning to the two of them. Delilah responded politely.

“Bell and I are assigned to clean the common room today.”

“I see. This is Sir Philip. Both of you, greet him.”

They bowed courteously, and Sir Philip returned the gesture with the noble smile characteristic of his status. After a brief exchange, he followed Darian and walked away.

Lisbell’s gaze lingered on his retreating figure a little longer than necessary.

“Bell! What are you doing?”

Delilah’s voice snapped her out of her reverie, and she quickly replied, “Coming,” before stepping into the common room. As she walked, Sir Philip’s image floated in her mind.

It was a face that evoked a sharp sense of déjà vu.

It wasn’t a matter of having seen him somewhere before. No, it was the expression itself—one that appeared composed on the surface but was painfully worn and hollow within. It reminded her of someone she had seen in the mirror while caring for her mother in Marnia.

It reminded her of herself, her past self.

She saw in Sir Philip a reflection of who she used to be.

Of course, recognizing this did not mean she could do anything about it. But the flood of raw memories he stirred up brought with it a sense of kinship and empathy, uncovering a wound she thought she had buried under layers of resolve.

Having a sick family member is a heavy burden.

It made perfect sense why Sir Philip visited the monastery so often, enough for the sisters to recognize him. He was clinging to whatever he could for hope, desperate enough to offer even his soul if it meant relief.

Who loves more deeply? A parent for their child, or a child for their parent?

Lisbell dismissed the thought as a pointless question, joining Delilah in cleaning the common room. At the time, she assumed her fleeting encounter with Sir Philip was the end of it.

So when she later found him alone in the chapel, she was taken aback.

It was a time when there were no regular services. Lisbell had never seen anyone else during her quiet visits for reflection. Thus, when she opened the door and noticed an unfamiliar figure seated in the middle of the pews, she froze for a moment.

At first, she didn’t recognize him as Sir Philip. She merely thought he was someone, like her, seeking a fragment of peace.

Then, faint sobbing began to rise, muffled and restrained, but audible nonetheless.

Lisbell, seated a few rows behind him, didn’t need to crane her neck to confirm the source. The man’s once-straight shoulders had slumped, and his upright posture had collapsed. He was crying silently, as if carrying the weight of a deeply personal sorrow. His whispered prayers rippled through the still air of the chapel.

She didn’t need to see his face to know who he was. The image of his melancholic expression from earlier came vividly to mind. Remembering his frequent visits to the monastery erased any doubt.

She could also guess the content of his tearful prayer.

He must be pleading for his daughter’s life.

It was no different from when she clung to each line of scripture, wishing desperately for her mother to open her eyes.

Feeling uneasy, Lisbell stood up earlier than usual, intending to leave him in peace.

But she didn’t make it far before stopping. Hesitating, she reached into her pocket and pulled out a handkerchief she always carried just in case. Weaving between the pews, she cautiously approached him.

As she got closer, she confirmed that it was indeed Sir Philip. So engrossed in his emotions, he didn’t even notice her presence. Lisbell hesitated briefly before opening her mouth to speak gently.

“Um…”

He startled and opened his eyes, which were brimming with tears. The intricate colors of the chapel, refracted through the mosaic windows, illuminated the deep sorrow pooled in his expression.

Lisbell hesitated, unsure of what to say, and ultimately chose to stay silent as she extended the handkerchief.

Sir Philip, clearly taken aback, accepted it with a slightly bewildered look. A moment later, he seemed to realize the gesture was meant to comfort him. Lowering his gaze, he let out a long sigh, heavy with unspoken emotions. Even his breath carried traces of lingering sadness.

“Thank you. I’ve shown you an unsightly side of myself.”

“It’s nothing.”

Using the handkerchief to wipe away the tears on his cheek, Sir Philip glanced at her briefly.

Soon, his gaze shifted, becoming more inquisitive.

“I am Philip Winchester. I’ve been visiting this monastery for many years, but I don’t recall seeing your face before.”

Though they had briefly exchanged greetings earlier, it was likely too fleeting for him to remember her. Lisbell thought it reasonable and responded calmly.

“I recently joined under Lord Darian’s recommendation.”

“And your name is?”

“…Bell.”

When introducing herself, she often found her full name, “Lisbell” almost slipping out. Only after a moment’s pause did she manage to offer the appropriate response.

Sir Philip nodded and fell silent for a moment before asking another question.

“Did you overhear my prayer?”

“No. I only heard… the sound of your sorrowful crying and came to check.”

He gave a faint, bitter smile.

“At my age, crying like this in front of others is hardly dignified. Yet, I can’t seem to help it. Whenever I come before God and speak, it feels as though the reins holding me together unravel completely. I have a sick daughter, you see. Thinking of her feels as though my heart is being torn apart.”

Although she already knew of his circumstances, Lisbell decided it was better to remain quiet and simply listen.

“Bell, you see…”



“I would do anything—absolutely anything—if it meant my daughter could live a better life. If she could go outside, bask in the sunlight, and run freely, I’d give everything I have to make it happen.”



“That’s how desperately I wish for it.”

Lisbell hesitated, her lips moving wordlessly for a few moments before she finally mustered the courage to speak.

“…I understand.”



“My mother was gravely ill as well.”

She refrained from adding that, unlike Sir Philip, she had lacked the power or resources to do anything about it. She couldn’t afford to make significant donations to the monastery, couldn’t frequent this place as if it were her home, or plead with God for a miracle. All she could do was endure, suffering under the whims of the man who loomed over her life, with no means to fight back.

Even though it was now a part of her distant past, the mere memory of it left a bitter taste in her mouth.

“So… I sincerely hope your daughter regains her health.”

He didn’t say anything in response. Concerned that she might have said something wrong, Lisbell carefully studied his expression, but it didn’t seem that way. Rather, it felt as though he was at a loss for words—or perhaps his throat had tightened.

It seemed her words, her shared experience, had resonated with him on a profound level.

This wasn’t mere human sympathy; it was a deep, bone-deep connection born from shared pain.
