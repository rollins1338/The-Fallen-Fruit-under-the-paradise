The Fallen Fruit Under the Paradise.
Chapter 1.

Under the bright sunlight and vast meadows, in the
charming resort city of Southwest, Marnia, where a gentle
breeze tickles the green grass. The mansion built on its
quiet outskirts was famous as the twenty-third mansion of
the Altahart family, known as the prestigious name in
Rechem. The building, constructed in a unique style by an
architect, was so magnificent that it was more akin to a
fortress than merely a ‘mansion’, reflecting the unparalleled
status of the Altahart family in the great nation of Rechem.
Despite its grand construction, the mansion constantly
emanated a cold aura year-round, attributable to three main
reasons. First, every member of the family resided in the
townhouses of the capital. Second, the Altahart family
owned more than twenty other mansions across the
country, excluding this one in Marnia. Lastly, Marnia was too
mundane and dull for the family to leverage their greatest
strength, their astronomical wealth accrued since the
ancient era that ended the White War, through their
unrivaled intelligence network. For these reasons, the
Marnia mansion had been left vacant for quite some time.
Yet, cobwebs did not form, nor did dust gather on the
windowsills, thanks to the ever-present staff employed to
maintain the place in the absence of the owner.
The staff unanimously agreed that this mansion was the
best workplace in the world. There was no employer
watching their every move with hawk-like eyes, and despite
the given freedom, their salaries were absurdly high
compared to other jobs. Whether they had come knowingly
or stumbled upon it by chance, everyone hoped to stay here
for life.
In the morning, a pleasant breeze would blow between the
chirping sparrows, and by noon, the clear chimes of the
town’s church would ring. At night, the starry Milky Way
would spread blue across the ink-black sky. Marnia mansion
boasted such beautiful and serene scenery. There’s a saying
that boredom is a sweet punishment from God, but it did not
apply here in Marnia. Boredom was a great blessing.
Mrs. Osborne, now in her third year of working at Marnia
mansion, wholeheartedly agreed. The repetitive daily
routine was a rightful happiness. She arrived promptly at
seven o’clock to inspect the mansion diligently for any
issues. Ten minutes before noon, she headed to the
bedroom on the third floor, holding the mail delivered by a
beret-wearing postman on his bicycle. Upon entering the
bedroom, she went straight to the desk, using a paper knife
on a refined stand to open the sealed mail for the owner.
Then, the sound that awakened the city’s vigor was heard.
Ding-dong.
It signaled noon as the church bell started ringing from afar.
The clear, pleasant sound resonated like waves into the
wide-open bedroom. The second ring sounded unusually
loud due to the annoyed groan coming from the bed behind
the drawn curtains. After finishing with the mail, Mrs.
Osborne clasped her hands and took a few steps back.
And at the third ring, the curtain was roughly drawn back.
First to touch the floor were the two muscularly split legs
beneath a disheveled nightgown. 
“…Madam.”
The man’s voice, who had just woken up and was in a foul
mood, crawled on the floor as he covered his face with his
hand.
“How much should I pay to make that bell stop?”
It had been a month already. Since coming down to Marnia,
the man had been consistently disturbed from sleeping in
by the bell. The church bell, rung as a greeting to God,
tolled twelve times before stopping. Yesterday, he endured
until the fifth toll, but today it was only three. At this rate,
he might wake up even before the bell rings tomorrow.
“Good morning, Master,” Mrs. Osborne said, bowing calmly.
The man rubbed his temples, likely from a mild migraine,
causing his splendid platinum blonde hair to slightly shake.
“Yes, damn good morning indeed.”
The brilliance of his hair made her squint, but his face
exerted an even more refined allure. Even just awakened,
with not a drop of water touching him, his appearance was
captivating enough to draw every woman’s gaze. No need
to look far; Mrs. Osborne herself was mesmerized. She had
never seen such a beautiful man in her life. When he first
appeared at the mansion, she dared to think he was not the
owner of this magnificent second house but a typical
wandering poet living off his looks, who sweetly wooed
wealthy ladies and expertly swindled them. Of course, that
misconception was quickly dispelled by the luxurious car
that roared like a beast and the land ownership certificate
for this place from the car’s trunk.
Indeed, the long-abandoned Marnia mansion had suddenly
regained its owner overnight. A month ago, for some
reason, the second son of the family, Ulrich Altahart, had
descended here before dawn without any attendants.
With a dreamy look of someone not fully awake, Ulrich lazily
brushed up his hair, reminiscent of the soft sand on a beach.
Then he got up from the bed, lit a cigarette, and took a
drag. His sleepy eyes fell on the mail Mrs. Osborne had
placed down. He flicked through the mail with his fingers,
soon grabbing a tabloid from the bottom.
“Hmm.”
His well-shaped lips let out a short sigh. It was clear what he
was looking at. Mrs. Osborne had also read the article this
morning. The article, titled “A Nobleman’s Outing? Who Is
the Stranger at the Abandoned Mansion?” had a small
picture attached beneath it. It was a cropped photo of
Ulrich’s face from a family photo that every citizen of
Rechem would have seen at least once.
“These photos were not distributed to be used as tabloid
fodder.”
Showing near-disgust, he stubbed out his cigarette on his
face in the photo. His splendid, flawless face turned back to
Mrs. Osborne.
“Anyway, could you call the lawyer?”
“Yes, Master.”
It was an expected outcome. With this, the total number of
newspapers sued by him in Marnia alone reached three.
Judging by the situation, it seemed this newspaper, which
had dared to publish his article, would also end up
dissolving without a penny in compensation.
“Why can’t people just respect someone’s right to live
quietly?”
“Considering the family’s status, it’s only natural for
everyone to be interested.”
“Annoying Altahart fame.”
Ulrich threw the cigarette butt into the ashtray and sat on
the bed. Mrs. Osborne clasped her hands calmly as he
languidly gazed out the window, savoring his freedom here.
“Master, there was a call from the capital this morning.”
“Didn’t I cut all the phone lines?”
“Yesterday around noon, you called the capital’s law office
to check if the village church could be sued for noise
pollution.”
“Oh, right.”
Sighing at his forgetfulness, Ulrich looked back at her.
“What did they say?”
“The same question as before. When do you plan to return
to the capital?”
“That’s enough.”
Cutting off the conversation, Mrs. Osborne politely inquired
about meal plans and any specific instructions before
bowing respectfully.
“Master.”
“Yes?”
“I have a personal request for permission.”
“What is it?”
“I need to take a leave of absence for a while.”
“Leave of absence?”
“Yes.”
In his eyes that turned to her, there was a mix of curiosity
and subtle reproach. The reproach asked who would take
over the duties if the person managing the mansion took
leave, and the curiosity wondered about the reason despite
knowing this. With such blue-grey eyes questioning her,
Mrs. Osborne bowed deeply.
“My daughter is getting married soon.”

Chapter 2.
His eyebrows twitched, raised, and then returned to their
original position.
“You are a wife and you have a daughter?”
“Yes.”
A smile like a flower petal hit by iron appeared on the
woman’s face.
Although they had only been together for a month, Ulrich
had realized that she had a very rigid personality. Whether it
was because of her role as a general manager or her
inherently rigid nature, her laughter was often so faint that
it was hard to tell if she was really laughing.
So, just seeing that rare smile, he could guess how much
she cherished her daughter.
“This time, she is officially getting married to her fiancé.
After the wedding, she plans to leave for a foreign country
with her fiancé, so I would like to take a leave to spend time
with her before that.”
Mrs. Osborne’s leave had been planned for quite some time.
There was no problem with the process.
Because the Marnia Villa, where she worked, did not have a
specific owner, it was not a big deal for her to leave her post
temporarily. In such cases, it was just a matter of calling the
relevant department of the main house, which supervised
the employment of the villa workers, and getting
permission.
However, coincidentally, the second son of the capital had
come down here. Since Ulrich was practically the owner and
employer, she felt it necessary to seek his approval first.
“Hmm, I see. Congratulations. It’s a family celebration.”
“Thank you.”
“But what about me?”
Ulrich raised his chin. His playful attitude, slightly wrinkling
his brow, did not allow the other person to feel any such
emotion.
In Ulrich’s pupils, an unwelcome expression surfaced.
He didn’t particularly like his surroundings to change. More
precisely, he didn’t prefer the environment he liked to
change without his consent.
Whether it was people or things.
Even though it had only been a month, Ulrich didn’t find
Mrs. Osborne to be too bad. She was quick-witted and wellbehaved, and didn’t particularly bother him in the
countryside villa where he came with no expectations.
Her leaving wasn’t the problem. The problem was the
possibility of someone replacing her whom he might not
like.
His question was short and quite self-centered, in line with
this thought process.
Mrs. Osborne couldn’t find words and just moved her lips.
She seemed flustered by the unexpected situation.
Watching her, Ulrich got up from the bed and walked to the
open window.
The sound of bells had long ceased. With that, the natural
sounds of the pure city were pushed by the wind and came
inside.
“Where are you planning to spend time with your
daughter?”
“I was planning to go to Misley since I was taking a leave.”
“Misley.”
Ulrich lightly nodded and spread his arms wide to grasp the
window frame. His broad shoulders seemed to fill the
window, emphasizing his presence. His manly physique
enhanced his delicate appearance, giving it a more
mysterious atmosphere.
“Hmm.”
Ulrich tapped his fingers on the window frame. Soon, he
turned around with a leisurely movement as if dancing a
waltz. Leaning diagonally against the window frame, there
was a sense of relief in his gaze toward her, as if he had
found a solution.
“Instead, how about calling your daughter here?”
“Pardon?”
“Marnia is also a suitable city for a vacation.”

“I think it would be nice for the mother and daughter to
spend good time together here.”
They said the world of the rich revolves solely around their
own comfort. Despite appearing generous, there was a
hidden selfishness aiming at their own benefit.
Ulrich was like that now. It was just that his elegant
demeanor filtered it in a way that didn’t seem crude.
Mrs. Osborne quickly caught on to this aspect.
She had already heard about it.
Following the second son of the family who arrived at the
dawn’s light to Marnia, his secretary had advised her that
Ulrich’s stubbornness was unmatched. Therefore, she was
urged to serve him well to avoid any unnecessary friction.
It wasn’t just words.
As a member of the wealthiest family in Rechem, her basic
salary had been tripled. Perhaps because it was a family
built on piles of greed, they could immediately grasp what
others desired and use it without leaving room for
complaints.
“If you agree, I will cover all the expenses for any leisure
activities you and your daughter do here.”
“It’s a very generous offer, but honestly, I don’t know if it’s
necessary for you to go that far.”
“You might not understand, but for me, this is the simplest
way.”
Ulrich crossed his arms and smiled lightly.
“It’s just about buying any possible variables with money.”
“…..”
“That’s the favorite solution of my family.”
There seemed to be a faint trace of disgust behind his
smiling face.
Mrs. Osborne maintained a calm demeanor, unsure whether
to be grateful or bewildered.
“I think it’s a very gracious offer. However, I should consider
my daughter’s opinion as well. Could I get back to you after
contacting her?”
“Sure.”
Ulrich, who was looking at the vast green plains outside,
nodded absentmindedly and then uttered an exclamation.
Mrs. Osborne, who was about to leave, turned to look at
Ulrich.
With a proud smile, he opened his mouth.
“What’s your daughter’s name?”
*
“Lisbell!”
It was a moment when the fresh laughter of the children
surrounding the classic piano filled the air.
From afar, a loud voice calling her could be heard.
Lisbell’s hands, which were energetically playing on the
keyboard, stopped first, and then her head turned towards
the door. At the end stood her fiancé, Theodore.
“Theo.”
She jumped up with a lively greeting, and the eyes of the
children around the piano followed her. In the next moment,
the group moved to the door with a loud cheer.
Theodore handed small candies to the orphans who quickly
gathered around him, smiling kindly.
“I’ve told you many times, if you all rush over like this, you
might fall.”
Theodore’s words made the children laugh even more. As
she watched with a smile, Theodore looked up as if he felt
her gaze. His light brown hair swayed in the wind blowing
through the door.
“Lisbell, let’s head to the station. Time is tight.”
“Yes, we should.”
“The kids asked you to play the piano again, didn’t they?
Really.”
“Don’t be like that. I offered to play for them.”
The children, who were watching the conversation with their
necks stretched, chimed in with “Yeah,” “She said she
would,” and “You always tell us off” competing to speak
first.
With so many of them, it quickly became noisy. Feeling
awkward, Theodore clapped his hands.
“Alright, your favorite Lisbell has to leave now. You can listen
to the rest of the music when she returns from her trip.”
Before the children’s demands got any longer, Theodore
took Lisbell out of the chapel. Her luggage bag, placed in
front of the chapel bench, was already moved by Theodore.
“Shall we go now? It’s quite tight to get to the station on
time.”
Holding Lisbell’s hand after taking the bag with one hand,
Theodore intertwined their fingers and lightly kissed his
lover’s cheek.
As they walked together, they chatted.
“Mrs. Osborne knows you’re leaving today, right?”
“Yes. I talked to her a few days ago.”
“I was really surprised. I thought she would come here, but
suddenly you’re going to Marnia.”
“Tell me about it. I was surprised too.”
Lisbell giggled.
Yes, who would have known she would suddenly go to
Marnia?
The reason for this change was not her or her mother, but
her mother’s employer, who had appeared out of nowhere.

Chapter 3.
A week ago, I received a call from my mother, who manages
an empty villa in Marnia.
The conversation lasted longer than expected, but the gist
was this:
A month ago, the villa’s owner had to come to Marnia
urgently. He expressed a desire for the caretaker not to
leave her position, and in that vein, he suggested that if it
was acceptable, why not have Lisbell come to Marnia and
spend some time together.
The subtle persuasion underlying this proposal was the
constant financial struggle that had accompanied the
mother and daughter up to this point.
In truth, Mrs. Osborne was skeptical about spending time
with her daughter before the wedding. It wasn’t that she
disliked spending time with Lisbell, but she was worried
about the expenses that would naturally follow.
The concern wasn’t lost on her daughter, Lisbell, who,
despite having a father who owned a fairly large factory in
their hometown, was still significantly disadvantaged as she
was raised in a modest single-parent household.
Mrs. Osborne had saved diligently for Lisbell’s college
education, and Lisbell had juggled various part-time jobs
during her semesters as a library assistant and as a tutor
during breaks, all to save for the future.
Despite their hard work, the thought of spending part of
their savings on making memories before the wedding was
a burden for Mrs. Osborne.
It seemed as if the villa’s owner had seen right through Mrs.
Osborne’s concerns. He offered to cover all expenses if they
spent time in Marnia.
My mother said it was up to me, but she subtly hinted that
she hoped I would follow the owner’s wishes. Understanding
her feelings well, I chose to go to Marnia.
“Did you say the villa owner is from the famous Altahart
family?”
“Yes.”
“Wow, that’s impressive. It’s incredible that your mother
works so closely with someone like that.”
“My mother has been at that villa for three years, and this is
the first time she’s seen him. She said she was quite
surprised when he showed up without any prior notice.”
“Well, nothing is really known about that family. Honestly,
before you mentioned it, I wasn’t even sure they were real
people. Although their business dealings flood the financial
news, there’s never any information about their personal
lives.”
Altahart’s family was famously wealthy, but very little was
known about its members.
The only public information about them was a single blackand-white family photo.
“Except for that odd rumor about the eldest son.”
“Odd rumor?”
“You know, the recent gossip about the Altahart eldest son
being gay. It caused quite a stir because it came out when
he was supposed to be engaged to the Schwaben family’s
daughter.”
I remembered that incident.
It was the first time a private matter about the family had
leaked. It created a buzz in places like the capital, Laurent,
and even in our quiet town of Misley.
Private newspapers didn’t miss the chance to spread the
story. I vaguely recalled seeing a similar headline on a
tabloid when I was at the square.
“But then the story disappeared overnight, leaving rumors
that someone envious of the family spread the gossip on
purpose.”
The social circles in the capital were ruthless, and Theo
shook his head as he looked at me.
“Anyway, Lisbell, you’re going to meet someone from that
amazing family.”
“I suppose so.”
Theo, curious and excited, kept chattering away, and I
responded with occasional smiles and nods.
We arrived at the Misley station by carriage. Theo was right;
we were cutting it close. As I took the bag he handed me, I
glanced at the main clock on the platform.
“Thanks for bringing me, Theo.”
In front of the open train door, Theo took my hand and
kissed my white knuckles.
“Travel safely, Lisbell.”
“Please convince your mother. I know you can do it.”
Knowing the purpose of my trip, Theo gave me his heartfelt
encouragement. His warmth reached me, and I winked at
him in gratitude.
“See you when I get back.”
Indeed, when I returned, our planned wedding would be one
step closer.
His eyes sparkled with cherry blossom-like excitement.
Feeling my heart flutter, I boarded the train.
I saw Theo waving outside as the train slowly departed. I
waved back with a bright smile.
The scenery blurred as the train gained speed. The platform
where the train had briefly stopped became a speck. Letting
go of the mixed feelings of regret and anticipation, I moved
to my seat as indicated on my ticket.
I carefully took my seat. Across from me sat two elderly
gentlemen who seemed to be traveling together. One wore
a fedora and was reading a newspaper, while the other, with
an unlit pipe, gazed out the window.
“Look at this.”
“Hmm? What is it?”
The man in the fedora handed the newspaper to his
companion, who leaned in to read. His eyes moved busily as
he took in the content.
“Ha, Altahart again?”
“Is there ever a financial page without news about them?”
“True… So, another hotel is opening in the capital?”
“It seems so, but they’re differentiating it from their existing
hotels.”
“Where, where…”
“Here, look at this part.”
“A special suite available only to VIPs?”
The man with the pipe sounded incredulous.
“The price is over three times that of a regular room. Who
would spend such a fortune for just one night?”
“If it’s an Altahart venture, it could work. Here, it says they
plan to link the accommodation with the Alstad department
store.”
“Targeting the wealthy, I see. Well, they say money begets
money, and there’s no lie in that.”
By chance, they were discussing Altahart. Their
astonishment showed how another venture by this
prominent family was expanding in a unique way.
It was no surprise. The foundation of every new business in
the capital had been laid by the Altahart family. They were
pioneers of wealth. Other families with companies were left
scrambling to catch up, tearing their pants in the process.
Altahart.
Leaning against the window, I whispered the distant name
to myself. Theo’s previous conversation and the reactions of
the gentlemen before me made the name ‘Altahart’ seem
like a surreal reality.
Everyone knows, yet no one truly knows.
That was the consensus and the general perception of the
name ‘Altahart.’
There was a clue in the conversation I had with Theo.
While everyone was aware of the comprehensive businesses
they ran and the enormous wealth they accumulated, very
little was known about the individual family members. What
was known was limited to a group photo, the names, ages,
and the business each member managed. That was the
extent of what the capital’s newspapers covered.
In other words, their private lives were never covered by
any major newspaper.
This indicated that the Altahart family had the power to
control the media in the capital.

Chapter 4.
They too were people who lived day by day, and indeed,
there was a life that existed. Especially because of the
prestige and value of the family, they must have attracted
countless curiosities.
Therefore, naturally, such a conclusion follows.
Despite the attention that would follow even the slightest
finger movement, the reality of no private life exposure at
all suggested that this was also their power and strength.
“Somehow… I’m getting nervous.”
Lisbell rubbed her side hair against the window.
Right now, the thought of meeting someone whose name
inevitably comes up no matter where you are in the country
made her heart thump lightly.
The train crossed rapidly towards the southwest.
Lisbell spent a long time on the train, taking brief naps,
composing a piano piece for the orphans at Misley, and
leisurely observing the outside scenery.
The distance to Marnia was quite far, so she had to transfer
trains once. Since it wasn’t a city with overnight operations,
she had no choice but to stay at a shabby inn near the
station and board the train again the next morning.
Just when her body could no longer endure the stiffness, she
finally arrived in Marnia.
Perhaps because it was a place known for being a resort
city, a pleasant breeze enveloped her whole body as soon
as she left the station.
Lisbell opened her luggage and took out a notebook. After
firmly memorizing the address she had carefully noted
during her phone call with her mother, she quickly walked to
where the carriages were.
The path she found by asking around wasn’t boring. The
sights of Marnia, which she was seeing for the first time in
her life, made it so. As she passed through the bustling city
streets lined with government offices responsible for the
city’s circulation and shops that enliven the residents, a vast
open meadow unfolded.
The green grass swayed slowly to the left and right in the
wind. It looked like a giant green wave. The landscape that
naturally made her curl her fingers into a fist was like a
scene from a fairy tale.
It wasn’t long before Lisbell got off the carriage.
Beyond a path that seemed to be led by trees, part of an
unmistakable mansion could be seen.
Keeping her eyes on that trace, she walked diligently, and
soon the path ended. At the same time, what appeared was
a huge iron gate surrounding the mansion.
And in front of it was,
“Mother.”
Perhaps because she had informed her in advance about her
expected arrival time, Mrs. Osborne had come out to meet
her.
With a smile, Lisbell ran towards her. Her mother, extending
her arms, embraced the daughter who had come a long
way. From the hands patting her back, a warmth that she
could always feel transferred.
“Have you been well?”
“Of course. It must have been hard to come all the way
here.”
“No, not really. On the way here, I thought it was rather
fortunate that you didn’t come to Misley. I had to transfer
trains and sit continuously, so my back got really stiff. I
think it was better that I came.”
“Did you? Let’s go inside first.”
Mrs. Osborne, who stroked her talkative daughter’s cheek,
took Lisbell’s luggage, which had been set aside for their
reunion.
Lisbell declined, saying she was fine, and took it back
herself. Then, she carefully began to speak.
“You seem to have lost a bit of weight since I last saw you at
the graduation ceremony. Are you feeling unwell?”
“I’m perfectly fine.”
Mrs. Osborne, calming her concerned daughter with a gentle
smile, headed inside the gate. Lisbell followed her.
“How is Theodore doing?”
“He’s fine. He wanted to come with me this time too, but it’s
a very busy period at the orphanage because of an
inspection, so we couldn’t both leave.”
“Haha, he’s still so diligent, isn’t he?”
“Yes, he kept asking me to convey his regards to you.”
Even just the land outside the gate seemed vast and open,
and the garden inside was no different. So, as Lisbell and
her mother chatted, she looked around here and there.
Noticing her daughter’s curiosity, Mrs. Osborne briefly
explained the layout of the garden.
The pavilion wrapped in decorative rose vines, the silverframed fountain with sparkling water flowing as if brought
from the sea, the statue with clear relief, and the greenishyellow car parked beyond.
And finally,
Droplets leaped into the air.
The lively spray felt refreshing and cool, and only when it
did she discover the swimming pool basked in full sunlight.
“We should greet him first.”
Mrs. Osborne pointed at the swimming pool with her eyes
and led the way. Lisbell swallowed nervously as she
followed.
The water surface moved as if alive.
The energy slicing through the water was powerful yet
relaxed. Broad shoulders and white skin supporting them
briefly appeared and then disappeared with the fierce
bubbles.
Soon, a sound of liberation echoed as someone emerged
from the water. The droplets that splashed made Lisbell’s
mind suddenly clear as if she were drenched.
The form gradually took shape over clear eyes.
Platinum blonde hair, still wet from the water, clung faintly,
and the well-defined abs of his upper body became more
prominent.
The noon sunlight made the water covering him sparkle.
Maybe that’s why he seemed to sparkle so much.
Finding his long hair cumbersome, the man brushed it back
to reveal his forehead and turned toward the source of the
sound.
Instantly, their eyes met.
At the same time, the massive bell sound rang out as if it
would shake the earth.
Although she knew it was the church’s device set to ring at
regular intervals, her heart pounded because the sound of
the bell and the shock she received felt similar.
He was an incredibly beautiful man.
If he had stayed still, she would have believed he was a
sculpture crafted by a god.
But he was undoubtedly real.
The playful action of scrunching his eyes and covering his
ears as if annoyed by the loud bell proved it.
Of course, Lisbell had already seen his face in the
newspapers.
But the feeling was completely different.
The small, black-and-white, low-resolution newspaper photo
couldn’t capture the man before her. Words like
“remarkable” or “handsome” that people said after the
photo was released were insufficient to describe him.
The man swam towards the safety ladder at the edge of the
pool. As he climbed up, his exposure, already leaving no
room for her eyes, became even more noticeable.
Despite standing in front of others with only his lower half
covered, he showed no signs of shrinking.
While Lisbell’s eyes rolled in embarrassment, Mrs. Osborne
quietly moved. She approached the man with a towel
prepared by the pool and draped it over his shoulders. The
man bent slightly to accept it naturally.
By then, the bell sound had been forgotten.
“Lisbell?”
The man, shaking his wet platinum blonde hair, approached
her. Hearing her name from his mouth felt surreal. As she
pondered his identity, the man casually extended his hand.
“Nice to meet you. I’m Ulrich Altahart.”
The elegant baritone voice created by his rolling tongue
awakened the bewildered Lisbell. Only then did she realize
he was offering a handshake and hurriedly accepted it.
“N-nice to meet you. I’m Lisbell Osborne. I was honored to
receive an invitation through my mother.”
Ulrich smiled, crinkling his delicate eyes at her timid voice.
He tightened his grip on her hand momentarily before
releasing it.


Chapter 5.
A gaze that was close to searching wandered across Lisbell’s
face.
“Miss Lisbell looks just like her mother.”
Ulrich monotonously whispered as he released the hand he
had once gripped tightly.
“Every time I see your mother, I think she has a very
classical beauty.”
“That’s too kind of you.”
It was Mrs. Osborne, not Lisbell, who responded to the
compliment, as if it were not something she could refuse.
Ulrich shrugged and turned his back after giving her a
glance.
He approached the pergola shaded by a thousand threads of
fabric, removed his towel, and donned a housecoat. Then,
he took a cigarette from the case on the table and lit it.
There was no urgency in his actions until he lit the cigarette.
He seemed accustomed to making the person waiting for
his next words endure, his every gesture exuding a leisurely
air.
“I don’t know how long you’ll be staying here, but I’ve asked
them to give you the best guest room, so please rest
comfortably.”
Leaning against the table, he exhaled smoke and gently
curved his mild eyes.
Lisbell quickly bowed her waist.
“Thank you for your consideration.”
“Don’t mention it. I heard you’re soon to be married to your
fiancé.”
“Oh….”
“Hm? Is that not the case?”
“Oh, no. That’s right.”
She was slightly surprised that her mother’s employer knew
such details. She had not expected an employer of
Altahart’s stature to be so caring as to know every detail
about his employees.
He smiled brightly at Lisbell’s confirmed answer, waving his
hands. He swept up his still-wet hair.
“When do you plan to have the ceremony?”
“Probably around August… I think.”
“August.”

“You’ll be a bride in late summer.”
He spoke softly as he stubbed out the cigarette in a crystal
ashtray after taking a few more puffs with a nonchalant
attitude.
“Congratulations on your wedding in advance.”
Ulrich, who had briefly concluded the conversation,
straightened his leaning body.
The muscles of his chest, faintly visible through the parted
robe, were taut. It was a wild aspect that did not match his
elegant and handsome appearance.
“Mrs. Osborne, after you take care of my meal today, feel
free to spend your time as you wish. It wouldn’t make your
daughter, who has come from far away, feel neglected.”
“Are you going to the study?”
“Yes. If the review of the documents is delayed any further,
Loisden will come down here to devour me alive.”
He turned toward the pool, muttering that it was best to
avoid troublesome matters. Then, he waved his hand to the
two women in a lighthearted manner more fitting for a child.
The grace he had exuded earlier momentarily disappeared.
Mrs. Osborne respectfully bowed to that leisurely figure.
Lisbell, standing beside her, followed suit, bowing
inadvertently. A faint chuckle came from the retreating man.
With the villa’s owner gone, Lisbell followed her mother into
the shaded mansion.
She had thought it was appropriately sunny for noon, but
inside the building, it felt slightly chilly.
The interior was just as luxurious as the exterior. Despite
having been neglected for a few years, the mansion had
been under strict management for the past month since its
owner returned.
“This is the room you’ll be staying in.”
“Where will you be staying, Mother?”
“I usually use the attached annex next door, but while
you’re here, I’ve been allowed to stay with you. It’s the
room right next door.”
Relieved, Lisbell set down her luggage and looked around
the room.
She realized that when they said they were giving her the
best guest room, it wasn’t just words. The room was
exceedingly luxurious for the daughter of an employee. The
selection and placement of the furniture, decorations, and
even the size of the room showed great care.
It was a room fit for a noble young lady coming to enjoy a
party, not just an ordinary person’s daughter.
“You must be hungry after the long journey. Shall I prepare a
meal?”
“Yes, that would be nice. Can we eat together?”
“After I serve the master. Can you wait until then?”
“Of course.”
Lisbell replied cheerfully and sat on the bed. Unlike the
dormitory bed from her college days or the orphanage bed
she currently stayed in, it made no creaking sound. It must
be very expensive.
“Mother…”
“Yes?”
Mrs. Osborne, who was closing the curtains to block the
sunlight from her daughter, turned her head.
“Is he really that Altahart?”
“Yes.”

“Why do you ask?”
“He feels a bit different from what I imagined.”
Lisbell lowered her gaze. Mrs. Osborne, guessing what her
daughter was thinking, silently smiled.
“Yes, I felt the same way.”

“Because there’s so little known about him, there are bound
to be preconceived notions. He seems a bit unique, but he
doesn’t seem like a bad person.”
“Yes. Just seeing how he cares for us.”
Lisbell looked at her mother. Her purple eyes, like frozen
purple blossoms, sparkled transparently.
“Is there anything I should be particularly careful about
while I’m here?”
“Well… I haven’t been given any specific instructions, but
we should avoid doing anything that might upset the
master.”
“Yes, I will.”
“You must be tired from the journey. Rest while I take care of
the master’s meal.”
Mrs. Osborne gently stroked Lisbell’s shoulder and left the
room. Lisbell approached the window.
While Mrs. Osborne thought this meeting was just to create
one last memory before the wedding, Lisbell had a different
purpose.
After marrying Theodore, Lisbell planned to move to another
country with him. They dreamed of establishing a primary
school in a remote area to teach the growing children.
It was a dream she had held since entering college. Even
when she kept it to herself, her mother, Mrs. Osborne, was
always part of that vision.
However, she realized it was just her own bright wish during
a conversation with her mother before graduation.
Her mother, who Lisbell expected would follow her, refused.
She declared she would stay in Marnia and continue
managing the villa.
“Why, Mother?”
“Your marriage is your future and hope, not mine. Lisbell, I
am very happy just knowing I raised you to this point. I think
it’s wonderful that you’ve grown up so well without a father.
So, when you create a new family independent of me, I want
to remain here as a place you can always return to. As your
hometown and starting point.”
At that time, Lisbell couldn’t understand why her mother
wouldn’t choose to live with her.
But over time, she began to understand.
Lisbell knew better than anyone the burden her mother bore
raising her alone. She knew it must have been a difficult
process, one that couldn’t be handled with ordinary
affection.
Her mother’s maternal love was still strong, and now she
couldn’t bring herself to burden her daughter.
As people age, the weight of life increases. There are more
places to hurt and more things to care about. Her mother
couldn’t shake the thought that all future hardships would
burden Lisbell.
As she began to understand this, she had to step back but
couldn’t completely give up.
After graduating from university last winter, Lisbell and
Theodore stayed at a small orphanage in Misley, constantly
pondering. She still wanted to take care of her mother
closely. Theodore agreed with her.
“I hope you can persuade her. You can do it.”
The encouragement Theodore gave at the station
strengthened her resolve.
So, Lisbell was determined to persuade her mother during
this trip.
“…Hah.”
But upon arriving and seeing Altahart’s villa, her
determination began to waver. As she had anticipated, it
was too good a workplace to give up just for relocation.
If the employer had been bad and ill-tempered, she could
have used that as a reason to persuade her mother, but
there was nothing unpleasant about the man she met today.
Rather, he was so kind that she felt naturally inclined to bow
to him.
There was no need to recall the recent memories; even her
mother’s words reflected it.
When a subordinate says, “He’s not a bad person,” it means
he’s truly good.
Lisbell pressed her forehead against the glass, staring
blankly.
Even the migrating birds flying across the sky seemed
peaceful. It felt like the first day at Altahart’s villa would
pass quite blandly.

Chapter 6.
Tweet Tweet
As the sunlight pierced through her eyelids, Lisbell
reluctantly woke up.
With a long yawn, she brushed her messy, tangled hair
aside. Her fine, curly hair often got tangled while she slept.
It was a feature she didn’t particularly like when she was
younger, but she didn’t mind it as much now.
“Why don’t you like it?”
“It takes so long to fix. Other girls can just smooth their hair
down with their hands, but I can’t do that.”
“I always thought it was adorable, like a little cloud.”
Ever since Theodore had said that with a shy smile, the curls
didn’t seem so bad. Though her hair was more like rain
clouds with its light ash color than fluffy white clouds, being
called cute made her heart flutter.
“Mmm…”
Stretching, Lisbell turned her head to look out the window.
It was the third morning in Marnia.
After a quick wash, Lisbell checked the time.
Seeing that it was still before noon, she knew her mother
would be busy with her duties as the villa caretaker.
According to what she had heard yesterday, today was the
day supplies were delivered, so her mother would be
occupied with sorting them all morning.
Although they had come to Marnia for a vacation together,
her mother had to continue managing the villa. The
employer, who wasn’t pleased with her mother’s absence,
had agreed to cover the expenses in exchange for this
condition.
It wasn’t an uncomfortable arrangement for Lisbell or Mrs.
Osborne.
This was a good deal for both Lisbell and Mrs. Osborne.
Having one more person at the villa didn’t significantly
increase her mother’s workload.
This meant that once the essential tasks were done, Mrs.
Osborne had plenty of free time.
Having dinner together until late into the night two days ago
and enjoying a barefoot walk along the beach yesterday
were results of this freedom.
I’m not sure, but…
He doesn’t seem to be a bad person.
Despite asking if there were any precautions she should
take upon arrival, Lisbell hadn’t seen the man since that
first day.
Seeing her mother occasionally leaving to attend to him
made it clear that he was staying at the villa. However, due
to different routines or perhaps to avoid disturbing their
mother-daughter time, they had not run into him even by
chance.
Looks like I have some time left.
Her mother’s tasks would take a bit longer to complete.
Wondering how to pass the time, Lisbell remembered the
library she had discovered while exploring the villa
yesterday.
She hadn’t been warned against entering any specific areas.
So, she decided that borrowing a few books wouldn’t be a
problem and left her room with enthusiasm.
The morning library was quiet.
Lisbell moved silently among the bookshelves. Thanks to
her studies in humanities, she recognized many author’s
names and titles.
She hadn’t expected much from the library of a villa, but
there were quite a few good books. Her initial plan to
quickly grab a few books turned into a full exploration,
examining each neatly arranged book.
“If you keep going, the day will break before you know it.”
Her hand, which was brushing the spines of the books,
froze. Lisbell quickly withdrew her hand and turned around.
The first thing she noticed was the bright platinum blonde
hair. Ulrich was sitting at a desk, backlit by the window,
gazing at her with his chin in his hand. Shocked to realize
someone else was there and then recognizing him as the
villa’s owner, whom she hadn’t seen for three days, Lisbell
pressed herself against the bookshelf.
“Oh, I’m sorry.”
He tapped the desk with a fountain pen and squinted at her.
“Did I say something to apologize for?”
“Well… it looks like you’re working, and I interrupted you.”
“You were moving so quietly, though.”
“…”
“I was just thinking you were like a cat.”
“…”
“If you had kept going, I might have checked under your
skirt to see if you had a tail.”
He must be joking, right?
Unsure of his intentions, Lisbell gave an awkward smile.
Ulrich responded with a faint smile as if acknowledging her
reaction.
He lowered his hand from his chin and crossed his arms.
“Is the selection not to your liking?”
“Pardon?”
“I thought I stocked it with quite rare books. Even some not
registered in the Royal Capital Library.”
“No…! As you said, there are many good books, so I was
just taking my time looking.”
“I see.”
Ulrich stood up from his chair. With a few long strides, he
was already beside her. 
It seemed he intended to choose books for her, running his
long fingers along the book spines.
The difference in their height was apparent. The fifth shelf
was the highest Lisbell could reach on her tiptoes, but the
third shelf was easy for him, and he could probably reach
the first shelf without effort.
“Mrs. Osborne must be busy?”
He asked, his voice resonating in the quiet room, making
her eardrums itch.
“Yes. Today is the day supplies arrive from outside…”
Ulrich chuckled. His eyes twinkled with mischief as he
looked at her.
“Someone might think you’re a worker here, Lisbell,
knowing things even I don’t.”
He picked a book and placed it in her arms. The title was
*Why Cats Raise Their Tails*.
“I heard it from my mother yesterday. She mentioned she’d
be busy all morning…”
“So, you came to the library.”
“Yes, that’s right.”
Tak, Tak
As she inspected the books he added to her pile, her
response became slightly delayed.
*The Nature of Cats*, *Things to Consider to Understand
Cats*.
Surely not, but Ulrich kept handing her books only about
cats. She had thought he was joking about the cat comment
earlier.
Unable to hide her confusion, Lisbell alternated between
looking at the books and the man in front of her, finally
speaking up.
“Um… I appreciate your recommendations, but…”
Ulrich, who had been grabbing another book, paused and
laughed. His laugh, which could have seemed frivolous,
didn’t come off that way due to his striking features.
Chuckling like a mischievous boy, he spoke in an
incredulous tone.
“Mr. Altahart?”
“What’s with that ridiculously formal title?”
“Well, um…”
“Why do you call me that?”
“Isn’t that how you should be addressed?”
“Well, yes, older business partners do.”
“…..”
“People your age call me by my first name.”
Ulrich watched her with amusement as she nervously bit her
lip, realizing he wasn’t entirely wrong.
Most people who called him by his first name right off the
bat had ulterior motives. They wanted to establish some
sort of connection, for social or business reasons.
In other words, Lisbell had no such hidden agenda. Instead,
she was clumsily drawing a line, maintaining a distance. Just
like a cat.
“You remember my first name, right?”
“Yes, of course.”
“Then use that.”
“…”
With his permission, there was no reason to hesitate, but
her lips felt heavy.
As she hesitated, Ulrich’s eyes narrowed. He began piling
more books into her arms. Eventually, he started pulling
them from the shelves in clusters.
It was clear what he wanted.
“Stop…! Ulrich, stop. That’s enough…!”
Only after hearing his name did he stop piling the books.
The stack of books was so high she could barely see his
face. Through her blurred vision, she saw him with a
satisfied, languid smile.
“Is this enough?”
“Yes, enough…”
As she answered, exhausted, he took the books back from
her arms.
“Why was that so hard? I’ve been calling you Lisbell from
the start, haven’t I?”
“…”
“By the way, Lisbell, your name sounds like a fruit.
Something easy to pluck and eat.”

“….What?”
“Your mother seems to have a talent for naming.”
I was dazed for a moment, wondering if I had heard
correctly. Ulrich’s face was suddenly too close, leaning
slightly towards me. Even from a distance, his appearance
was enough to make anyone lose their composure, so facing
him up close was unimaginably overwhelming.
“Your mother named you, right?”
“Oh, yes. That’s correct.”
“The name suits you well.”
“Thank you… very much.”
It felt like a storm had passed through my mind.
All I did was stand still and have a conversation, but why did
it feel so chaotic…
Eventually, everything returned to its place, and Lisbell, with
just a few books left in her arms, straightened her back.
Although it was done in a bit of a daze, she had chosen her
books. Just as she was about to say she would be leaving,
Ulrich reached out his hand. His beautiful finger even
tapped lightly on the book Lisbell was holding.
“Where are you going to read this?”
“Of course, in my room…”
“Why don’t you read it here?”
“What?”
Lisbell’s eyes widened like a rabbit’s.
“Why… why should I?”
She expressed her question as politely as possible,
wondering if there was any reason to do so.
“I’ve been getting a bit tired of working alone here.”
“…..”
“I think it would be nice if you could keep me company
occasionally, like now.”
“Me? Wouldn’t someone else be better suited for that?”
“Are you suggesting I bring in a servant? Then who would be
appropriate? Would Mrs. Osborne, who’s likely busy, be
suitable?”
His voice was as gentle as silk, but the underlying meaning
was quite different. His unyielding stubbornness was
beautifully wrapped, making it difficult to refuse.
After a moment of contemplation, Lisbell thought it was
better for her to spend time than to have her mother stand
guard, so she reluctantly shook her head.
Seeing her half-resigned demeanor, Ulrich smiled and led
her to the library table. It was placed in front of the desk
where he was sitting. He even pulled out a chair for her,
leaving no excuse for her to leave.
Lisbell was worried he might start spouting nonsense again,
but surprisingly, Ulrich focused straight on his work upon
returning to his seat. Glancing at him once or twice, Lisbell
cautiously opened her book.
Scratch, scratch.
Flip.
The sound of a fountain pen’s nib moving across paper and
the thin pages turning alternated. The breeze softly rustling
the closed window blended into the atmosphere, making
Lisbell feel why her mother always said over the phone,
“There’s no problem here.” She turned one page after
another, immersed in the tranquil environment.
At some point, the sound of the fountain pen stopped.
Realizing this subconsciously, Lisbell looked up and found
Ulrich staring at her. As soon as their eyes met, he asked,
“How do you feel about your upcoming marriage?”
Lisbell awkwardly scratched her neck, surprised by the
unexpected question.
“Actually… it still doesn’t feel real.”
She wasn’t just being coy. It was the truth. There was a time
when marriage felt like a distant matter, irrelevant to her.
When she occasionally thought about those days, it made
her feel detached from reality.
“Do you love your fiancé?”
The next question was rather direct. This time, she felt too
shy to speak.
But answers don’t always require words.
Ulrich expressed a faint gasp of amazement.
“Wow, you blush just thinking about him?”

“That’s quite pure love.”
Ulrich seemed genuinely fascinated by her visible devotion.
He rested his chin loosely on his clasped hands.
“How did you two meet?”
“We met during a university charity event.”
The two had no direct connection, being from different
departments, but the Misley Orphanage brought them
together. Instead of going home during the holidays, they
participated in charity work at Misley, and they grew closer.
At the time, Lisbell was responsible for basic math education
and music lessons using the piano, while Theodore handled
physical education and other tasks requiring strength.
Before they spoke, they were aware of each other’s
presence. One day, while Lisbell was secretly practicing the
piano in the chapel, Theodore approached her first.
From that day on, they greeted each other, dined together,
and had tea whenever they could, gradually developing
their relationship smoothly, as if it was destined from the
beginning.
“I heard you plan to leave the country with your fiancé after
the wedding.”
“Yes, we plan to run an elementary school there together.”
“An elementary school? So… you’re going to be a teacher?”
Lisbell laughed, slightly embarrassed, at Ulrich’s playful
tone, calling her “Teacher Lisbell.” Though shy, she didn’t
seem entirely displeased, as a faint blush appeared on her
cheeks. Ulrich, observing her healthy glow, chuckled softly.
“Do you like children?”
“Yes, of course.”
“Lisbell, you seem to have a lot of things you like.”

“The world must be enjoyable for you.”
The remark sounded a bit strange, causing Lisbell to stop
smiling and face him properly.
She wanted to read his expression, but it was difficult. The
light from the window behind Ulrich cast a shadow over his
face, making it look like a living shadow itself.
Feeling inexplicably parched, Lisbell hesitated before asking,
“Doesn’t that suit you more, Ulrich?”
Judging from the background alone, it seemed that way.
From her brief time at Altahart, Lisbell had vaguely grasped
the value and lifestyle it represented.
As the owner of such a luxurious estate, with many obedient
servants at his command and the ability to indulge in
whatever he wished whenever he wanted, it seemed like a
life lacking nothing.
It seemed too opulent for an ordinary person like her.
“Do I look happy?”

“Why do you think so?”

“Because I’m Altahart?”
He tilted his head slightly.
As the angle changed, the shadow covering Ulrich’s face
lifted. His expression was calm, almost disappointingly so,
making Lisbell’s concern about offending him seem
unwarranted. But it was so emotionless that it felt abrasive,
like sand covering a desert.
“Well, at least I have enough conscience not to say I’m
unhappy.”
Ulrich flipped over a document that had been on his desk.
“But Lisbell, do you know?”

“Curiosity and excitement stem from ignorance.”
His beautifully formed fingers gently folded the paper. Once
on one side, then the other, and several more times.
“Conversely, when ignorance disappears, it’s hard to feel
those things.”

“Everything in the world becomes trivial.”
After folding the paper for a while, he finally held it up. It
was shaped perfectly for flying.
Whoosh.
With a light flick, it floated through the air. The paper model,
fluttering aimlessly, landed between the pages of Lisbell’s
open book.
“When that happens, life becomes very…”
“…..”
“Very boring.”
The man’s compelling presence made it impossible for her
to look away, even from the paper model’s intrusion.
However, it was different from when she was simply
mesmerized by his looks.
Now, it was as if the subtly crafted smile reminded her of
earlier melancholy, appearing dangerously fragile. It was
hard to describe any other way.
“To the point where you’d want to kill yourself before turning
thirty.”
The calm remark turned her suspicion into certainty.
This present sense of despair was the abyss of a living man.
As if he wanted to hang himself out of sheer boredom with
the world, just as he said.

The atmosphere, which had changed in an instant, became
heavy, making her fingertips tingle.
An overwhelming wave of discomfort came over her. Her
thoughts dulled, unsure of what to say or how to respond.
Just as her lips were meaninglessly moving, trying to utter
something, the church bell chimed, marking noon,
enveloping the library.

It’s truly elegant.
Once again, doesn’t it seem as if my heart is being
helplessly crushed by that bell?
I felt strangely suffocated. No, it’s not even strange. After
all, the shocking words that would leave anyone stunned
came out of that noble-looking man’s lips with such
composure.
Didn’t he just say… suicide?
I didn’t hear it wrong.
The more I mulled it over, the clearer it became.
My chest tightened, as if a boulder I couldn’t possibly handle
had been placed on my outstretched palm, which I believed
would be light.
If Ulrich’s attitude had genuinely matched such heavy and
difficult emotions, things wouldn’t have turned so serious so
quickly.
He showed no significant change from earlier. His
indifferent, playful, somewhat relaxed and lukewarm
demeanor made it clear to Lisbell that he could carry out
what he said without hesitation.
As I couldn’t continue speaking, the bell kept ringing.
…Ten times, eleven times, twelve times.
The silence in the already quiet study deepened. The sound
of the bell filled the room, spreading widely and deeply, and
felt particularly stiff.
I reluctantly shifted my gaze from the window frame to him.
At that moment, Ulrich’s smile had completely changed.
From a cold sneer that felt icy even without touching it, to a
gentle form that seemed to carry the warmth of spring.
“It’s a joke.”

“Judging by your expression, I should choose my jokes more
carefully with you, Lisbell.”
He chuckled and shook his head.
The tension that had briefly filled me dissipated. Only then
could Lisbell manage an awkward smile in response.
“Oh, right. A joke.”
“Yes, a joke.”

“Bearing the name Altahart, I could never commit such a
disgraceful act.”
Flutter.
Ulrich’s tone, as he flipped through the documents, was
sharp. It seemed to carry a hint of subtle irritation, but his
smiling face made it hard to be certain. Lisbell had a feeling
that the man might be very adept at acting.
“By the way, it’s already noon.”
Ulrich, who had just signed the last document with a
flourish, rose from his seat. Lisbell also realized how much
time had passed and closed her book.
“I’ll go to my bedroom and get some sleep. I’ve been
getting up early for the past few days to catch up on work,
and my head feels constantly foggy.”
He yawned slightly, indicating it wasn’t just a comment.
“Could you tell Mrs. Osborne that I’ll be skipping lunch?”
“Oh, yes. I will.”
With a slight nod, Ulrich left the study first.
Hearing the door close, Lisbell stood up slowly, holding a
paper model she had taken out before closing her book.
She approached the desk, which had a peculiar order
despite appearing cluttered. Considering how well Ulrich
worked in this chaos earlier, there must be an unseen order
within the disorder. The ornate, gold-trimmed fountain pen
left uncapped was one such element.
Thinking vaguely, Lisbell carefully placed the folded paper
model next to it.
The shadow that fell to one side grew ominously dark.

The sound of the bells filled the chapel sweetly.
The rich array of notes blended with the light hitting the
stained glass, creating a dreamy sensation. This floating
feeling was the legitimate euphoria offered by the
mysterious power of religion.
On Sunday morning, I visited the church of Marnia with my
mother. We attended the regular service for Holy Week.
Lisbell wasn’t a particularly devout believer. If it weren’t for
following her mother today, she wouldn’t necessarily attend
Holy Week.
Unlike her, Mrs. Osborne was quite devout, which was
related to her status before she married.
Mrs. Osborne had originally been a nun at a convent in a
foreign country. She was abandoned there as a baby in a
basket, grew up in that compassionate environment, and
naturally walked the path of a religious devotee.
However, she became pregnant by chance.
Despite the religious doctrine that everyone is worthy of
love under God, certain strict rules were to be adhered to in
the life of a devotee. Nuns were required to remain celibate
to serve as vessels for God. Naturally, bearing a child was
considered sinful.
Upon discovering her pregnancy, Mrs. Osborne immediately
left the convent. She moved to a distant rural village and
gave birth to Lisbell, whom she had carried for ten months.
From that day on, Mrs. Osborne devoted herself to caring for
and raising her only daughter.
Many practical barriers made her life difficult. Having relied
on religion all her life, she was naturally ignorant of how to
earn money. But money was necessary. It was indispensable
for raising a child. Whether to fill the baby’s stomach or to
keep her warm in cold, rainy, or snowy weather….
To provide for Lisbell, Mrs. Osborne took on any job she
could find. She didn’t differentiate between what she could
or couldn’t do. She went anywhere that offered payment.
When she couldn’t leave the baby behind because she was
too young, people would click their tongues, calling her
tough.
Despite this, she endured and lovingly cared for Lisbell. She
raised her through harsh and bitter times, shielding her
under a small canopy from the wind and snow.
As Lisbell began to babble and speak, they became
inseparable friends. Mrs. Osborne would smile as if she
owned the world at the child’s simple words and gestures.
Though their world wasn’t warm, it wasn’t cold either. It
offered a small warmth that could thaw frozen hands and
feet.
Some memories were hazy, others clear as day, allowing
Lisbell to understand the hardships her mother had
endured. Learning about her own background, she also
came to know her mother’s original profession.
With that knowledge, an affectionate guilt began to form in
her heart.
Her mother hadn’t disliked being a nun. The soft smile she
wore when talking about her life there was proof. Therefore,
it was entirely because of Lisbell that she had to leave that
comfortable community.
If only I hadn’t existed.
Lisbell had begun to have such thoughts so long ago that
she could no longer remember when.
Ironically, this guilt was mutual. Her mother always felt
sorry for having brought her into a life where she had to
face unnecessary hardships. For instance, enduring
relentless poverty and hardship.
Lisbell couldn’t understand her mother in this regard. Yet, at
the same time, she did understand. The more she thought
about it, the clearer it became. It was as obvious as looking
into a mirror. They shared the same feelings without an
ounce of difference.
In other words, their mutual incomprehension stemmed
from a place of deep affection.
And this affection created a sense of dissonance.
After going through a phase where they shared every detail
of their day, they started keeping things to themselves,
thinking it better not to say certain things out loud. They
became cautious, fearing that even a small misstep could
shatter their delicate relationship like a glass jar.
Their love and care for each other, while well-intentioned,
didn’t always manifest healthily or beneficially.
Excessive consideration can sometimes cause pain, just as
their relationship became a very thin glass wall. It’s possible
to tap on it, but any more than that and it might break.
Questions that could easily be asked between mother and
daughter were internally censored first, and they both
pretended to be unaffected to avoid worrying the other.
It was a consideration that couldn’t simply be blamed on
one person.
This is why they had never talked about her father
Fearing that the presence might hurt her mother, she
avoided it, and it became a kind of taboo word. Her
mother’s love was so abundant that she never really felt any
lack in that regard.
“Hello, Sister Helen.”
It was near the end of the service.
Someone approached and spoke to her mother. Unlike
Lisbell, who was visiting for the first time, her mother
seemed quite familiar since she attended every Sunday.
A woman, who looked somewhat worried and wore a
mantilla like a devout believer, held her mother’s sleeve.
Mrs. Osborne interrupted her and looked at Lisbell standing
beside her.
“Lisbell, it looks like this conversation might take a while.
Could you wait outside?”
“Yes, I’ll do that.”
Lisbell nodded at the approaching woman and exited the
chapel first. Sitting in front of a flower bed with tiny stones,
she watched the bright yellow buttercups planted inside.
Soon, Mrs. Osborne approached.
Lisbell shook her head at her mother’s apology for making
her wait and pointed outside the church.
“Mother, I saw a lovely coffee house in front earlier. How
about stopping by there before heading back to the villa?”
“Shall we?”
The coffee house they went to was quiet, as it was not yet
noon. In the distance, a cheese-colored cat, presumably
owned by the house owner, waved its tail and meowed.
Lisbell took a seat by the window where the sunlight poured
in warmly, with her mother.
“So, how much more time do you need?”
“Pardon?”
“You have something you want to say to me, don’t you?”
Lisbell, startled, chuckled almost in resignation.
“Really, Mother, I can’t win against you. How long have you
known?”
“It’s obvious when you’re lost in thought every time we’re
together. Please understand my situation of pretending not
to notice even though I did.”
Mrs. Osborne smiled and sipped the coffee she had ordered.
Lisbell, feeling embarrassed, straightened her posture.
“I still want to be close to you, Mother.”

“Even after I get married.”
Though she said it with determination, her mother didn’t
seem particularly surprised. In the next moment, the calm
look on her face made Lisbell realize that her mother had
vaguely anticipated this topic.
“I’m very glad you think of me that way.”

“But I clearly told you before. My thoughts haven’t
changed.”
“Mother.”
“Lisbell, I have no intention of becoming a burden in your
future.”
“Why do you think of yourself as a burden?”

“How could you ever be a burden to me….”
Her mother’s warm smile felt like an unbreakable fortress
today. No matter how hard she tried to break it down, it was
a barrier she couldn’t cross. Feeling dejected, she bowed her
head slightly, and a gentle hand rested on hers.
“Leaving here doesn’t mean saying goodbye forever. Just
like now, you can see me whenever you want. We’ll meet
before your wedding too. Even if we live apart, we can still
stay in touch by phone or letters if the situation makes calls
difficult.”
“But….”
“Everything I have built is here. Moving to start a new life
there would be overwhelming and difficult. I worry it might
become a burden for you during that process.”

“So, I want to stay here and be your foundation. You need to
look forward rather than backward. I raised you with the
hope that you would move forward.”
Lisbell bit her lower lip.
Her mother’s resolve was firm, but the underlying affection
was palpable.
How could she insist further?
It was sad to hear her mother describe herself as a ‘burden’
or ‘past,’ but it paradoxically conveyed her true feelings.
Indeed, experience couldn’t be ignored. Her mother had
unknowingly persuaded her. A corner of her heart ached.
“Besides, I can’t give up such a great job like managing the
Marinia villa.”
Patting Lisbell’s hand, her mother made an awkward joke.
Lisbell, whose eyes were slightly red, paused before
deliberately smiling brightly.
Their ordered drinks slowly dwindled as they engaged in
conversation. They talked about Lisbell’s school days, her
teary moments before starting dorm life at university, and
other trivial memories.
Spending such harmonious time together, Lisbell reaffirmed
her belief.
Being her mother’s daughter was incredibly happy.
Though her mother often felt guilty about what she couldn’t
do, Lisbell’s memories were filled with the happiness her
mother provided. Moments of appreciating and enjoying the
happiness her mother brought.
The sun shining at their feet was a brilliant orange.
After a brief rest, they returned to the villa. Lisbell’s eyes
caught on something unusual. Beside the familiar greenishyellow car, there was a strange black sedan.
Who could it be?
Her curiosity was short-lived. Lisbell walked into the villa.
Returning to the guest room, she untied the ribbon at her
neckline and noticed a book on the wooden table. It was one
she borrowed from the study two days ago. She decided to
return it and left the room with the book in her arms.
The corridor leading to the study was long like a maze. As
she walked on the soft carpet, she heard a bang!
A gunshot.
Her instincts reacted before her rational mind. She stood
frozen, her heart pounding.
Bang!
Bang! bang!
The destructive sound that could shatter the peaceful world
continued. Lisbell quietly moved towards an open window.
Another bang rang out as if to shoot her down.
A long shadow cast on the ground.
It wasn’t a false déjà vu.
The man who sent her a folded paper in the past was the
one making these aggressive sounds.
It was Ulrich.
His profile was balanced and solid. His relaxed stance, the
rolled-up sleeves of his shirt revealing muscular arms with
bulging veins, and the black protective gear on his
shoulders were striking.
Bang!
A bullet flew at incredible speed and hit the target.
A distant target was set up. Lisbell wasn’t walking this
corridor for the first time. She had never seen such a target
here before. It seemed like an improvised shooting range.
Even after firing, Ulrich didn’t lower his arm. His
experienced stance showed he was no novice.
His straight back and firmly planted legs were steady. He
resembled a fierce hunter who never missed his prey.
Yet, there was an inexplicable nobility in his actions. The
gun, a symbol of violence, became a luxurious accessory in
his hands. Despite the loud, fierce sounds, he remained
calm and emotionless, creating an air of cold elegance.
But it was only for a moment.
A crease formed on his previously untroubled brow. He
lowered the arm he had been holding up towards the target,
frowning. The hand not holding the gun rose to massage his
shoulder, which was strapped with a protective pad. It
seemed that the recoil had made his muscles sore.
Now she noticed there was another person in the courtyard.
While Ulrich was firing at the target, a man who had been
standing to the side approached him as he stopped
shooting.
He was a stranger.
Though he wore a shirt and trousers, unlike Ulrich, who
looked more relaxed without a tie or vest and with rolled-up
sleeves, this new man wore a tie and cufflinks, giving him a
much more formal and respectful appearance.
The two men moved towards the shaded area of the
courtyard.
A long table stood there, neatly arrayed with guns spaced
evenly apart. The two men exchanged words. To be precise,
Ulrich spoke, and the new man diligently took notes in a
small notebook.
Suddenly, the black sedan near the fountain came to mind.
Perhaps he was from the capital. Judging by his attentive
demeanor, it seemed likely that he was Ulrich’s secretary,
assisting with his business affairs.
“Well, he did seem extremely busy.”
Ulrich’s busy schedule was something she had already
witnessed in the study. The towering stacks of documents
had seemed precarious, as if they might topple over at any
moment.
He handled the piles of paperwork as if such a workload was
nothing unusual, reviewing the documents with the same
impassive expression he had when he hit the bullseye.
“Ah.”
She involuntarily let out a small sound.
Ulrich, who had been talking with the man presumed to be
his secretary, was now looking up at Lisbell. With a formal
yet endearing smile, he waved at her. She didn’t know when
he had noticed her, but there was no surprise in his
demeanor. The secretary had vanished like smoke.
“Lisbell, what are you doing up there?”
“I was heading to the study when I heard gunshots. I was
curious about what was going on.”
“Ah, sorry. It must have been noisy.”
He glanced at the gun in his hand, then at her face, and
raised his arms in a gesture of mock surrender.
Lisbell felt her ribs tighten. It was a sign of tension. She
quickly recalled why she felt this way.
“I’d rather die before I turn thirty.”
Those words had lingered heavily in her mind.
Though he had immediately brushed it off as a joke to
lighten the mood, it was hard to fully accept his
reassurance.
Ulrich, who had undoubtedly reached his current position
through numerous business relationships, was undoubtedly
skilled in dealing with people. His eyes sometimes gleamed
with an unnerving clarity, suggesting he had an innate
ability to read situations.
So when he had downplayed the seriousness of his
statement, she couldn’t help but wonder if there was some
truth behind it.
Regardless of his true intentions, the fact remained that he
had spoken of suicide, a topic that pained her to even think
about, with a casual smile while holding a gun.
What if he suddenly turned the gun on himself and pulled
the trigger without hesitation?
The thought, which had nagged at her, now felt like a sharp
stab in her chest.
While Lisbell was lost in these unspoken thoughts, he
gestured calmly for her to come down. After a moment’s
hesitation, she nodded.
First, she went to the study to put the book back in its place,
then hurried down the stairs. Knowing someone was waiting
for her made her steps on the hallway carpet a bit more
urgent. Though she wasn’t running recklessly, she wasn’t
walking leisurely either when she arrived at the courtyard.
By then, Ulrich had removed the shoulder pad he had been
wearing like an epaulet.
Beneath the shirt, which clung perfectly to his frame, his
muscles moved dynamically. She knew what lay beneath the
fabric; she had seen his bare torso with her own eyes. The
scene of water droplets trickling down his chest and abs was
still vivid in her mind.
“Are you here?”
She nodded, and Ulrich’s hand suddenly reached toward her
face. Startled, she stepped back.
Ulrich’s eyes widened. Then he laughed softly and removed
a leaf stuck to her hair. He waved it playfully in front of her,
signaling that there was no need for her to be so wary.
Feeling embarrassed by her exaggerated reaction, Lisbell
murmured her thanks.
“I heard you went to the city with Mrs. Osborne.”
“Yes, we attended morning prayer together. We just
returned to the villa a short while ago.”
“Ah, church.”
After a brief response, he naturally changed the subject.
“Have you ever shot a gun?”
“No, never.”
It was her first time even seeing one in person.
“Would you like to try?”
“Me?”
Lisbell’s eyes widened.
Ulrich chuckled at her surprised reaction.
“Yes, you.”
“No, I’d rather not.”
“Why not?”
“…”
“Are you scared?”
“Yes.”
“There’s nothing to be afraid of. You saw it earlier, right? I’ve
already tested all of these. There’s nothing defective among
them. One had a bit of a strong recoil, but my secretary
already took it away.”
Despite his reassurances, she still felt uneasy. After all, she
knew these were weapons designed to harm others.
Sensing her hesitation, Ulrich sighed softly.
“You never know.”
The corners of his mouth stretched into a long, snake-like
grin.
“There might come a time when you want to shove a gun in
your husband’s mouth.”
He was clearly skilled in social interactions, but sometimes
his comments were so unpredictable and unsettling that she
couldn’t tell if he was just teasing her. Lisbell looked at
Ulrich, who could make such bizarre and disturbing remarks
as easily as he breathed, unsure whether to laugh or frown.
“Come here.”
Ignoring her reaction, Ulrich pulled her wrist.
“It’s not hard. As long as you hold it correctly and maintain
your stance, nothing will go wrong.”
His deep voice wrapped around her ears, making her think
of the hand that had just removed the leaf from her hair.
Ulrich positioned Lisbell beside him, pressing his body
against hers as he placed a pre-selected gun in her hands.
The cold metal felt strange against her palm.
“See, the trigger guard fits your hand perfectly. It felt a bit
tight on my fingers.”
“Am I holding it correctly?”
“Yes. And your other hand goes here.”
She was startled, not by the unfamiliar object in her hand
but by Ulrich’s natural embrace as he adjusted her stance.
She hadn’t expected such contact. The unfamiliar weight
made her eyes widen. Her heart tightened and then
released, sending blood rushing through her body. The
sudden increase in circulation made her vision blur
momentarily.
“Focus.”
Ulrich’s voice was calm and detached, as if to emphasize
that his touch was purely instructional.
His gaze was similarly detached, fixed intently on the target.
Lisbell was flustered.
It was clear that only she was overly conscious of the
situation.
She took a deep breath, trying to regain her composure.
Ulrich’s fingers brushed her shoulder, lightly squeezing and
then releasing, before slowly trailing down her waist to her
side.
The hand was over the blouse. The large palm moved across
the fabric, yet the warmth that can only be felt with skin-toskin contact seeped through.
Was it because the cloth was too thin, or was it because the
man’s touch was too slow and lingering?
In the midst of this ambiguous sensation, the air grew
sharp. The tension was so high that one wrong breath might
cut through it.
“Your waist.”
Perhaps her posture had slightly shifted due to tension.
Ulrich’s hand, now resting near her pelvis, applied strong
pressure.
Instinctively, she tried to pull away, but her body
straightened, finding its proper posture. This brought them
even closer, almost as if they were hugging if seen from
afar. Closing her eyes tightly from the intense tension, she
heard a low chuckle near her ear.
“It’s shooting practice, Lisbell.”

“You shouldn’t close your eyes.”

“Open them.”
At the quiet command, she lifted her eyelids, revealing thick
eyelashes. In front of her was the sleek muzzle of a gun
aimed at a round target.
“Don’t take your eyes off it.”
His voice, though soft as if it could melt, carried an
undeniable authority. It exuded a suffocating arrogance as if
it were natural for him to have others underfoot.
“Take a deep breath.”
The fear remained. Perhaps that’s why she was compelled
to follow his instructions even more rigorously.
Lisbell took a small breath in.
“Straighten your back.”
She straightened her spine, already stiff from the tension,
even more.
“Keep your legs steady.”
She pressed her feet firmly into the ground as if to brace
herself.
“Now, pull the finger you have on the guard inward.”
She squeezed her finger on the trigger.
Immediately, she felt a tremendous recoil. Her body, cradled
as if in his embrace, couldn’t withstand it and stumbled. Her
shoulder throbbed as if it were being crushed. The loud
gunshot left a slight ringing in her ears.
For a moment, her heightened senses gradually calmed
down, leaving only a stinging numbness in her palm.
“How was it?”
“Haah…”
“Doesn’t it feel refreshing?”
In a way, it did.
For a moment, she felt as if her body was floating in the air.
It felt like her heart had plummeted, similar to the sensation
of every nerve in her body screaming. It wouldn’t be strange
to believe that the bullet had hit her instead. Gradually, the
tension unwound, bringing a sense of relief.
But it wasn’t just refreshing. A tingling aftershock lingered in
her mind and body, reminding her that this was indeed a
lethal weapon.
It was a terrible relief.
“The result is pitiful.”
At his words, she quickly lifted her head.
What? Lisbell wondered. She had definitely aimed and fired,
but there was no new mark on the target. Ulrich glanced
towards something with his eyes. Not the target, but a tree
trunk where a mark had appeared.
Realizing she had damaged an innocent tree, Lisbell was
speechless. Ulrich took the gun from her hands, smiling.
“To think you didn’t even hit the target…”
“Well, it’s my first time. Unless someone has an exceptional
sense, that’s how it usually goes.”
“Did you… go through the same?”
“Hm.”
He laughed awkwardly.
“I managed to nick the edge of the target.”
“…You must have had quite a natural talent.”
Ulrich, checking the magazine, smiled brightly. It was a
compliment she accepted with a bow. Despite not expecting
much, the dismal result left Lisbell alternating glances
between the target and the tree, before focusing on the
target’s center.
“Still, you must have practiced a lot.”
“Hm?”
“All your shots earlier hit the center.”
“Oh, well. I practiced occasionally when I had the time.
Besides, the main house isn’t exactly a place where I can
practice comfortably.”
“Why not?”
It seemed there should be no difficulty in setting up a
makeshift target in the courtyard like now. Puzzled, Lisbell
asked, and Ulrich smiled wryly as if recalling something.
“My mother has a fit when it comes to fguns.”
Bang!
As he finished speaking, he quickly raised the gun in his
hand, took aim, and fired. A faint haze rose in the air. The
makeshift target among the thick branches trembled.
Again, the center.
There was no missing.
“One time, I showed her this, and she nearly fainted,
clutching her forehead. Her acting is so convincing that I’m
still not sure if it was real or not. As a result, my prized gun
was confiscated that day. It was a specially commissioned
piece with gold plating on the slide, one of the few in the
world.”
Lisbell blinked slowly.
It seemed like an exaggerated complaint, but given his
evident frustration, it made her think his mother might have
overreacted. Then again, she knew nothing about his
circumstances and could have just brushed it off as some
trivial noble matter.
But maybe… his mother knew something too?
Consciousness accumulates like sediment. His desire to die
didn’t come overnight. It might have emerged gradually,
adding weight over time until it could be discussed so
casually now.
Parents are often more sensitive about their children. They
tend to notice subtle hints that others might miss.
Perhaps that’s why his mother was so terrified and took
away the gun.
“Still, it seems you’re not entirely without talent. My college
friend couldn’t even hit the makeshift target. He was all
bluster and ended up firing into the ground. Those are the
kinds of people who shouldn’t talk about having a ‘sense’.”
“Haha…”
“How about it, Lisbell?”
“Yes?”
“Would you like to learn to shoot from me while you’re
here?”
He handed her the gun again. Feeling its weight in her
hands, Lisbell quickly shook her head.
“No, no, it’s fine. I don’t think it suits me. Honestly… I’m still
scared. My heart feels like it’s going to burst. It’s even worse
now that I’ve tried it. The fear of accidentally hurting
someone…”
“You’re quite timid.”
“It’s a gun. Any woman would feel the same. Besides, I’m
not staying here long enough… I’ll be returning to Misley
soon.”
Ulrich, who had been brushing his hair in the breeze,
paused.
“Lisbell, are you leaving soon?”
“Yes, I think so.”
Returning to the villa with her mother today, Lisbell decided
it was time to return to Misley. Her resolve, which was
almost like a mission, was bent by her mother’s gentle
persuasion, and she was increasingly worried about
Theodore, who was waiting for her alone in Misley.
“This vacation had a purpose. I wanted to persuade my
mother to move with me after my marriage. But… she’s
quite fond of this place. She firmly stated she wouldn’t
leave, so I can’t insist anymore.”
“I see.”
“Yes. Oh, by the way…”
“Hm?”
“Do you know of any good dress shops in town?”
During the morning service, she noticed her mother’s
sleeves were frayed. The fabric had been mended multiple
times, with the stitches clearly visible.
Having not lived a life of abundance, Mrs. Osborne disliked
spending money unnecessarily. She always taught Lisbell to
use it wisely and only when necessary.
And now, Lisbell believed that buying her mother a new
dress was precisely that necessary expenditure.
“A dress shop?”
“Yes, I’d like to buy my mother a dress before I leave….”
“Ah.”
He nodded as if he understood.
“A dress shop in town…”
He fell silent, his gaze distant. Soon, a charming smile
appeared on his face.
“Shall I go with you?”
“Pardon?”
“Let’s go together.”

“I’ll join you.”
A familiar smile approached her.
She had felt it before, but he often behaved in this friendly,
informal manner. He seemed well aware that his outward
appearance was a powerful weapon, and he didn’t hesitate
to make direct eye contact and draw close to people.
Even now, as he made this mysterious suggestion, it was
the same.
“Aren’t you too busy to be so concerned about me?”
Surprised, she asked belatedly, and Ulrich shrugged his
shoulders.
“Taking a day off won’t ruin my business.”

“Well.”

“Hm?”
Even a mute puppy wouldn’t beg like this.
Lisbell stared at Ulrich awkwardly.
She wanted to refuse, feeling it would be a bother in many
ways, but something held her back.
Something that still lingered in her mind.
A disturbing comment she had heard, something that had
stuck with her ever since.
It was a chilling remark that sounded like it came from
someone suffering from long-term depression….
Although she was not a medical expert and knew nothing
about clinical psychology, she understood that people with
such symptoms required careful handling. It was especially
bad to confine oneself to a limited space and reduce one’s
range of activity….
Unfortunately, the place where she heard talk of suicide was
a very secluded study. The scratchy sound of the fountain
pen she heard that day still echoed in her ears.

Ulrich coldly smiled inwardly as he watched the woman in
front of him deep in thought. He could easily guess what she
was thinking.
When he watched her standing in the hallway through the
glass earlier, she looked as worried as if watching a child
near water. And it had been like that for a while.
She had openly shown anxiety about suicide since the day
she overheard him talk about it.
Or perhaps not openly.
She thought she was hiding it well, but it was easy for Ulrich
to see through.
Maybe it was the inherent angelic syndrome common
among those aspiring to be teachers, or perhaps it was her
naturally caring nature. Whatever the reason, she seemed
concerned about him.
She didn’t seem to believe his casual attempts to pass it off
as a joke.
Which was true, in a way.
Talking about leaving the world before turning thirty had
been a frequent refrain since Ulrich graduated from
university.
Everyone is born ignorant.
Like a pristine, untouched snowfield. Like a blank page
without a single doodle.
A small dot marks the surface.
That is the primordial desire.
A tiny dot-like desire, curiosity, germinates within. Achieving
those desires one by one, learning about success and
failure, and understanding the accompanying pleasures and
displeasures.
Life is a long journey of fulfilling these conflicting desires.
The problem lies in that process.
As common desires are fulfilled one by one, they inevitably
lose their potency. The pleasure of the first experience fades
through repetition and learning. And the second and third
pleasures gradually lose their strength.
In the end, life filled with repetitive, uninteresting acts
reaches a point of transcendence. Nothing can excite or
interest anymore….
Sadly, this described Ulrich perfectly.
Having indulged in all sorts of stimuli since childhood, he
felt his post-university life had been exactly that. The world
had not lost its flavor suddenly; rather, his mind had gone
dull. Otherwise, how could everything in life seem so
monotonous, boring, and dry?
The comment about having no attachment to such a tedious
life was more than just a reaction; it was a habitual
utterance now, almost as natural as breathing.
Even in his family’s mansion, people used to panic
whenever he mentioned it. Initially, it provided a novel
amusement, but even that thrill faded, and now it was
dismissed as mere nonsense.
His mother, who once wept at such words, now merely
clicked her tongue, saying it was another of his bad spells,
while Gwen Altahart mockingly suggested he should write a
will to transfer hotel and department store shares to his
elder brother before kicking the bucket.
Determined to spite him, Ulrich resolved that if he were to
leave a will, it would state that he would sell all his shares
and donate everything to charity.
Anyway… setting aside his crazy family circumstances.
It had been a long time since anyone had shown such frail,
almost touchable concern for him.
It was vibrant.
A living reaction.
But the more he thought about it, the more he laughed.
The problem was the person showing the concern.
She was just a commoner. A trivial girl who should worry
about her own affairs rather than him.
Every time he saw himself reflected in her pure, innocent
violet eyes, the emotion called ‘pity’ surfaced
simultaneously.
How audacious and presumptuous. It was like a small mouse
licking a thorn stuck in a beast’s paw. The thought alone
made him laugh.
Yet, there was a refreshing novelty in her attitude.
Not just her behavior, but his own impulse to act childishly
in response to her pity was equally novel.
He wanted to test how much she could accept him. If he
said he wanted to die and asked for a blowjob, would she
hesitate like now and then comply?
The impulses came sporadically, like his damaged frontal
lobe twitching, mixed with mischievous and devilish urges.
“If you’re willing to do that….”
Accepting so readily, despite finding it uncomfortable to
even breathe in the same space, was just presumptuous
pity.
Thinking it was a rare opportunity to receive a commoner’s
pity, Ulrich let a bright smile touch his lips.
“Today’s timing is a bit awkward. It might take some time at
the tailor’s, so how about tomorrow?”
Lisbell nodded vigorously. It seemed like a response to his
smile.
The voice of the past, dreaming of becoming a teacher,
echoed.
Ulrich wrinkled his eyes and smiled as if scowling.

The center of Marnia’s city, Boilek Street.
A greenish-yellow car approached smoothly. It was a unique
color, flashy enough to catch the eye without being
overwhelming. Comfortable luxury.
A man stepped out of the driver’s seat.
He wore a light beige vest over a white shirt, with no sign of
a constraining tie. His casual, unfussy attire perfectly
matched the car’s comfortable luxury.
He walked around the bonnet and opened the passenger
door.
A woman hesitated as she stepped out.
Her outfit didn’t look particularly good, with a rather modest
underblouse and a demure goreskirt. Thin silk stockings and
brown flats showed no sense of aesthetic harmony, a
haphazard combination.
But her face was different. With finely chiseled features on a
slender face, her appearance was anything but ordinary.
Despite having the same eyes, nose, and mouth as anyone
else, her beauty was undeniable.
Most striking were her violet irises, capturing and focusing
attention.
Her outfit was plain, but if she dressed according to current
fashion trends, she could easily attract any man’s interest.
Ding-a-ling.
A clear bell rang through the tailor shop like a bird’s song.
Lisbell, following behind Ulrich, hesitantly stepped into the
upscale tailor shop.
“Excuse me, madam.”
Even before they entered, the madam had been watching
the car stop in front of her shop. “Oh my,” she exclaimed,
covering her lips. She seemed excited, as if seeing someone
rarely encountered here.
“We have a reservation under the name Victor Loisden.”
The madam’s anticipation visibly faded. Lisbell easily read
her change in mood. It seemed she had recognized Ulrich
from his newspaper photos, given her keen eye due to her
profession.
While she recognized him correctly, Ulrich’s nonchalant
demeanor, confidently using his secretary’s name, was
convincing enough to fool anyone, even Lisbell.
“Welcome. I’ve been expecting you.”
The madam soon regained her business composure, smiling
politely and leading them inside. People who earn money
often have a keen sense for potential profit, and the madam
of the tailor shop was no exception. After quickly assessing
the obvious differences in attire between the two, she
naturally gravitated towards Ulrich.
Of course, it wasn’t just about money.
Her faint blush indicated a clear romantic interest. Ulrich
was a man who naturally attracted such feelings.
“The customer here today is this lady.”
With practiced ease, Ulrich displayed his social skills, pulling
Lisbell’s wrist and subtly hiding behind her, making her feel
less out of place in the tailor shop.
“I’ll sit on the sofa, so take your time looking around,
Lisbell.”
“Oh, okay.”
The madam’s gaze quietly shifted between the two, then
she smiled meaningfully and led Lisbell further inside.
Meanwhile, Ulrich headed to a sofa by the window. Crossing
his legs on the plush velvet sofa, he picked up a catalog
prepared for waiting customers. The looks displayed,
claimed to be the latest trends here, had mostly already
swept through the capital.
Daring and glamorous trends always originated in the
capital’s social circles. Thus, a tailor shop in this dull, small
town confidently presented slightly outdated fashions as
trends. Ulrich leisurely flipped through the catalog,
reminiscing about the nostalgic relics.
“If it’s too difficult, why not ask the gentleman?”
The madam, bustling about earlier, now subtly suggested.
Knowing there was only one gentleman here, Lisbell
naturally turned her head.
As expected, both women’s eyes were on him.
“Is there a problem?”
“The lady is having trouble deciding.”
Hmm. Ulrich rested his chin on his hand.
Indeed, Lisbell looked overwhelmed, given too much
information at once. She was confused by the various
fabrics and different sleeve samples in her hands.
“You said you’re here to buy a gift for Mrs. Osborne?”
“Yes, that’s right.”
“How about trying it on yourself, Lisbell?”
“Me?”
“You two are about the same size.”
Before Lisbell could react, the madam clapped her hands,
agreeing it was a good idea, and quickly brought out sample
outfits.
Pushed to the back of the shop, Lisbell tried on the outfits
one by one and stood before Ulrich. She felt a vague sense
of shame, as if she wanted his approval. His gaze was more
serious than when reviewing business documents.
“What do you think?”
After a few fittings, the madam turned to the sofa.
In the sunlight, Ulrich, more radiant than the light, finally
spoke.
“The buttons are generally too many.”

“I prefer something easy to take off.”
At that moment, his usual elegance and dignity were
useless. It was such a crude comment that even the
madam, eager to sell her goods, was speechless.
“Maybe underwear would be better, madam.”

“It was a joke, but no one’s laughing.”
“The second one was the best.”
“Oh, my. I thought so too! It seems the gentleman and I
have similar tastes.”
The madam, recovering slightly, added a flattering remark.
Lisbell recalled the second outfit he mentioned.
It was a classic puff blouse with a high neckline and slightly
voluminous sleeves. It felt stifling just wearing it briefly, but
it suited her mother, who lived in a strict convent before
having her. His advice was appropriate, and since he was
her mother’s employer, anything he liked would surely be
fine.
“Shall I put the payment on my tab?”
Ulrich asked, seemingly ready to leave.
“No! I’ll pay for it.”
“Hmm? It’s fine.”
She remembered his offer to cover all expenses in Marnia.
However, she didn’t expect him to cover such individual
expenses.
She admired him anew. Though she hadn’t seen the bill, the
high-end tailor shop would be costly. Yet, for him, it was a
small sum he could easily cover. His confidence and ease
were second nature, showcasing the true power of Altahart.
“It’s a gift for my mother, so I should pay.”
Gratitude was gratitude, but fairness was fairness.
Ulrich didn’t argue further, letting her have her way.
“Alright then. Madam, we’ll take the second one. Lisbell, I’ll
wait outside.”
The madam, hoping he would visit again, bid him farewell.
Ulrich responded with a courteous smile and exited the
shop.
Lisbell paused as she was about to change back.
“…Excuse me.”
“Yes?”
“Can I buy this too?”
“Which one?”
“This…tie.”
“Of course. We’ve selected colors and patterns that are
currently in vogue.”
In an era where bespoke items were a luxury, factory-made
products like ties became popular.
A tie was fitting for this era. Unlike clothes, it didn’t require
size adjustments.
Since he’s been so considerate…
It seemed nice to give Ulrich a gift too, not just for his
kindness over the past few days but also as a token for
taking good care of her mother in the future.
She recalled the light beige vest he wore today.
The empty spot where a tie should be made it easy to
imagine. Considering the various light tones, Lisbell picked a
tie.
It was a deep, dark black, like the night.
Clack.
Putting down the receiver, Lisbell lowered her shoulders,
which had been tense with excitement. The voice of her
fiancé, who she had just finished speaking with, lingered
deep inside her.
She turned to look beside her, gently touching her earlobe.
While exchanging greetings with Theodore over the phone,
the sun had already set. The intense dusk that had crept
over the ground vanished, giving way to the quietly
spreading evening sky.
It had always been like this, a fairy-tale place. It was like a
piece of art framed by the window.
Today was the last day for enjoying this beautiful scenery.
When she mentioned she would return by train tomorrow
morning, Theodore was as purely happy as a child.
Three days had passed since she went to town with Ulrich.
And yesterday, Lisbell visited the tailor shop alone to pick
up the blouse she had ordered for her mother and the tie
she had bought separately.
Even though she had received an estimate earlier, when the
time came to actually pay, she felt suffocated. The endless
wealth of the man who generously offered to charge
everything to him was truly astonishing.
She gave the blouse to her mother as soon as she returned.
Her mother, though wondering why she had bothered, was
clearly pleased.
After a late lunch with her mother, they walked along the
meadow path outside the villa, discussing the types of
flowers. Lisbell had just finished a phone call with Theodore
upon returning.
The world was quiet under the darkening sky. In a rural
small town, the day was practically over as the sun set.
Returning to the room where she had stayed for the past
week, Lisbell took out a box she had stored under the bed.
Inside the box, with a calm navy blue background featuring
the tailor shop’s name, was a simpler tie.
There had been many opportunities to give it, but now she
was feeling nervous and kept avoiding it. She had chosen it
without much thought, but now that she had it, all sorts of
worries came to mind.
Would he like it?
Is the color too plain?
What about the design? The length?
Is it too plain without any decorations?
Was the price appropriate?
While she had been optimistic at the time of purchase, now
she was only seeing flaws.
More than anything, remembering Ulrich’s usual attire made
her hesitate. Even Lisbell, who wasn’t well-versed in fashion,
could tell his clothes were of high quality. Though he often
wore them casually, the finishing touches, the detailing,
even a single button, were all meticulously crafted. The
meticulousness of the clothing translated into its high cost.
His clothes were undoubtedly top-notch.
So she worried.
What if it doesn’t meet his standards? What if he thinks it’s
too low quality?
Given Ulrich’s personality, he wouldn’t show any
dissatisfaction, but still….
She knew that the essence of a gift was the thought behind
it rather than the object itself, but that only worked with
someone who had ordinary circumstances. She couldn’t
shake the worry that she might be burdening someone who
already had everything.
But, today was the last day she would see him.
If they had to face each other constantly, the gift might
become an awkward reminder for both of them, but she was
leaving Marnia tomorrow. It was pointless to worry about
how Ulrich would handle the gift. Even if he threw it away
immediately, she wouldn’t know, so it wouldn’t matter
much.
Or even if she did find out…
Lisbell was not someone important enough for Ulrich to care
about.
Alright, just give it to him since it’s bought.
Holding the gift box, Lisbell left her room. Recalling that he
was in the study earlier, she headed in that direction but
found him outside the window. It was an open pavilion near
the meticulously maintained garden and the ever-flowing
silver fountain. His silhouette was faintly visible against the
pavilion’s railing and steps.
Lisbell quickly changed direction and descended the stairs.
Outside, the sound of branches rustling in the wind could be
heard. The fairy-tale-like place had a distinct atmosphere
between day and night.
Sensing he was enjoying some solitary thought, she
instinctively quieted her steps. However, she couldn’t
completely muffle the sound of her footsteps, so Ulrich
noticed her as she approached the pavilion.
His eyes widened slightly in surprise at seeing her in an
unexpected place, then returned to their usual relaxed
shape. His lips curved into a subtle smile.
“Lisbell.”
He called her softly, chuckling lightly.
Was it because it was night? He seemed unusually relaxed.
If he were a ribbon, he usually maintained a tied form, but
now he seemed almost completely untied.
Lisbell soon noticed the glass in his hand.
“What brings you here?”
He asked, tilting his glass back and forth.
Lisbell scratched her cheek.
“Well, I wanted to give you something.”
“To me?”
Ulrich leaned back slightly, gesturing to the seat beside him
with his eyes.
“Why don’t you come up here instead of standing there?”
His manner of offering a spot beside him was without
hesitation. Then again, he always behaved this way,
unbothered by social cues. Even if she tried to avoid him,
his blatant persistence would always place them in the
same space.
Anyway, since she intended to give the gift, Lisbell climbed
the stairs with a calm heart.
“Would you like a drink?”
“Is it alcohol?”
“Yeah.”
He casually used informal speech. Though he occasionally
used a comfortable tone, he had never spoken informally
before. Clearly, he was a bit tipsy.
“No, thank you. I’m not good with alcohol.”
“Have you tried it before?”
“Yes.”
Oh, he softly exclaimed.
“Must be a bad memory.”
“Um, yes. I felt very sick the next day.”
“That happens when you drink too much.”
He chuckled and didn’t press her further, pouring another
glass for himself. Lisbell glanced at the outdoor table in the
pavilion. Besides the glass he was holding, there were spare
glasses, a bucket of fresh ice, and….
“What’s this?”
She asked, more out of concern than curiosity. Scattered
around his glass were a few pills. Seeing what Lisbell was
staring at, Ulrich pressed the pills with his fingertip.
“Drugs.”

“I’m kidding.”

“Lisbell, you faint if you hear two jokes. You always get so
serious. Is it rude if I say you’re the perfect type to tease?”
How could she not be serious when a man who had once
talked about suicide was seemingly playing with drugs?
Lisbell stared at him with a complicated expression, knowing
he was someone who made light of everything. He shrugged
his shoulders, still laughing.
“It’s sleeping pills.”
“Do you have insomnia?”
“A bit. Probably because my schedule gets mixed up a lot.”
Though she knew the nature of the pills, it didn’t bring much
relief. Even without medical knowledge, Lisbell understood
that combining such pills with alcohol was dangerous. It was
common sense. And surely, Ulrich knew this too. Yet, he was
doing it anyway, knowingly engaging in such reckless
behavior.
It was contradictory. His light-hearted jokes clashed with the
precarious undertone in his actions.
“Then wouldn’t a warm tea be better than alcohol?”
She suggested cautiously.
She was careful, thinking this might also trigger some deep
part of him.
Ulrich remained silent. Without immediately responding, he
continued pressing the pills with his fingertip. His eyes fixed
on Lisbell’s face as if hooking onto her expression.
Soon, he gave a subtle smile.
“Lisbell, did you say you wanted to be a teacher?”
“Yes? Yes.”
“Hmm.”
He furrowed his brows slightly, as if considering something
difficult, then flicked the pills off the table.
“It doesn’t suit you.”
“Pardon?”
“Being a teacher doesn’t suit you, Lisbell.”
Lisbell was taken aback.
No matter how straightforward and unfiltered one’s nature
might be, was it really acceptable to blurt out every thought
that comes to mind directly to someone’s face?
However, Ulrich was so confident and composed that it was
impossible to call out his rudeness. Even his arrogance
seemed to be part of his inherent power. Judging by the
atmosphere, she felt as if she should actually be grateful for
receiving such advice.
“…Why?”
Fundamentally, she was curious.
While he often said things that made no sense, this didn’t
seem like one of those times. Sometimes, his words and
actions seemed so calculated that it was as if he had
foreseen the ripples they would cause. It made her wonder
if he was a masterful actor.
So, she couldn’t dismiss his comment as mere nonsense.
In all honesty, she was curious why he thought that way.
Becoming a teacher had been her long-held dream. Many of
her envisioned futures revolved around it. Thus, hearing
that she wasn’t suited for it was quite a shock.
“Why is that?”
Ulrich simply added another enigmatic question and
chuckled softly, sipping his drink. She had a feeling getting
a clear answer would not be easy.
“More importantly, what did you bring me?”
He skillfully changed the subject.
Though she wanted to know the reason, it felt too difficult,
so Lisbell gave up and picked up the box she had set beside
her.
Ulrich raised his eyebrows, his expression momentarily
brightening with curiosity.
“I bought it at the tailor shop we visited last time. I wanted
to give it to you as a gift.”
“For me?”
“Yes. I’ve been indebted to you for a few days. Thanks to
you, I was able to spend a comfortable time with my mother
after a long while.”
“Can I open it?”
“Of course.”
She swallowed nervously.
Her heart beat a little faster. The lingering anxiety and the
anticipation that came with giving a gift coursed through
her body.
Ulrich’s long, slender fingers untied the ribbon around the
box. He lifted the lid, revealing a neatly folded tie in the
center of the box.
“A tie?”
“Yes. I didn’t know your taste, so I bought the most classic
one.”

“You might already have something similar… If you don’t
like it, you can give it to someone else or not wear it often. If
you really, really don’t like it, you can just throw it away…
Since it’s a gift I gave on a whim….”
The longer Ulrich stared at the box, the more Lisbell
rambled on.
Eventually, Ulrich moved.
He unfurled the neatly rolled tie and draped it around his
neck. Then, he adeptly tied it beneath his open shirt collar.
Just moments ago, he had seemed lazy and indulgent, but
with just a tie, he appeared much more tidy and neat. Yet,
the sensual vibe he exuded was undiminished.
“How does it look?”

“Is it pretty?”
It was a childish question, but she couldn’t argue with it.
It suited him much better than she had anticipated.
Though she didn’t know why he hadn’t worn a tie before, it
almost made her resentful for a moment, it suited him that
well. Given his perpetually languid appearance, she thought
a relaxed look would suit him best, but this look had its own
charm. Whether dressed up or down, he had an irresistible
allure.
“Is it bad?”
When Lisbell remained silent, Ulrich lowered his head as if
to inspect himself.
“No! It looks very good on you.”

“So much so that I can’t stop looking.”
Her worries melted away. She was glad she chose the most
basic one. With his naturally good looks, even something
unusual would have suited him, but the simple colors and
design transformed into something special and elegant
because of him.
Seeing her waving her hands as if worried about a
misunderstanding, Ulrich smiled. He then grabbed the
longer part of the tie and kissed it. His seductive action
made Lisbell momentarily hold her breath.
“Thank you, I’ll cherish it.”
Ah, she finally found the perfect word to describe him.
Seductive. Yes, that was exactly it.
Until now, the literary meaning of the word hadn’t quite
made sense, but now she understood its origin firsthand.
She didn’t need to look far. The strange warmth spreading
through her ears proved it.
“Lisbell, are you cold?”
He gestured with his eyes towards her light pink blouse,
suitable for the warm afternoon but not the cool evening
breeze.
Indeed, it was a bit chilly outside as the evening wind blew.
Ulrich’s gray-blue eyes traced the inside of her blouse’s
collar, unbuttoned for comfort, almost revealing her
cleavage.
“Your skin is very white.”

“Like a snowflake.”
He spoke again, this time more softly. It was hard to tell if he
was talking to himself or to her. She couldn’t respond,
feeling a peculiar sensation. Suddenly, something warm
touched the back of her neck. Realizing it was Ulrich’s
finger, Lisbell flinched.
Watching her reaction, Ulrich pulled the tie off and wrapped
it around her neck instead.
She was too flustered to move.
Sssk, sssk.
The sound of fabric brushing against fabric filled the close
distance.
Lisbell swallowed reflexively.
She didn’t know why he was doing this or why she couldn’t
move, but she felt she shouldn’t. Her palms sweated from
the inexplicable tension.
In the stillness, their eyes met repeatedly, each time
sending a shiver down her spine.
And then, she thought of Theodore.
Her fiancé, soon to be her husband, her lifelong companion.
No matter how she described him, he was a constant source
of comfort.
But now, it wasn’t the familiar, comforting feeling. It was as
if her chest was hollowing out. A discomfort impossible to
describe with words she had acquired throughout her life…


Their eyes met again.
In Ulrich’s light-colored irises, a fierce spark beyond that hue
flickered. Dangerous whirlpools stirred in the blue waves.
It was a moment.
Ulrich grabbed the tie around her neck and pulled her
towards him.
“……!”
Lisbell instinctively raised her hand to block his lips.
It was close.
Had she hesitated a moment longer…
Her heart pounded erratically.
Her eyes trembled as she tried to calm her racing heart. His
lips, blocked by her hand, continued to gaze at her intently.
She felt as if she might be devoured. One moment of
carelessness and she would be swallowed whole.
Her throat tightened painfully.
Denying it was useless. The angle of Ulrich’s face as if about
to kiss, her own hand blocking his lips, and their actions to
prevent and cause danger were undeniably the same.
They both felt it.
The tie squeezing her neck hurt and burned. But she
couldn’t focus on that. Her heart pounded loudly. The fierce
vibrations shook her entire body. It was hard to collect her
thoughts. Knowing she had to, the more she tried, the
dizzier she became.
It was bad.
The more she thought about what almost happened, the
clearer Theodore’s image became, and the harder it was to
describe her feelings.
Only a beat later could she fully define it.
Guilt.
This was unmistakably guilt.
Thus, Lisbell firmly defined one of his characteristics. He
was a man with a rather impulsive side. Otherwise, nothing
he was about to do made any sense.
In the distance, the moon sparkled. Its clear and transparent
light was as vivid as Theodore’s eyes watching her.
Her heart, which she had barely managed to calm,
plummeted to the ground.
This cannot happen.
Something felt dangerous. She couldn’t maintain this close
distance any longer.
She had to put distance between them.
She had to get away from him immediately.
From him…
“It seems you’ve had too much to drink.”
She had to push him away.
Lisbell hurriedly shifted her hips backward, as if to negate
what had just happened.
The distance, close enough to feel each other’s breath,
widened, and the necktie loosely held in Ulrich’s hand
slipped down.
Lisbell brushed her hair back. She was so flustered that it
felt as if someone had grabbed her head and shaken it.
The most incomprehensible thing was Ulrich’s behavior. He
knew she had a fiancé. With those delicate lips, he had
congratulated her on her engagement the first day they
met. He had even asked when the wedding was and
mentioned she would be a bride by late summer, offering
something akin to a blessing.
Despite that, why on earth…?
Doubts poured in, but Lisbell did not delve deeply into any
of them. The thought that this must not happen remained
strong.
Lisbell removed the tie loosely draped around her neck and
placed it in a box. Then she quickly stood up.
“I’ll be going now.”
“…”
“The night breeze is chilly, so don’t stay outside too long.”
Without checking if her words were appropriate for the
situation, she hurried out of the pavilion.
Perhaps she was still shocked, as the wind on her face felt
hot. The man’s eyes she had faced up close remained
disturbingly vivid. Trying to shake it off, she bit her lower lip
hard until it bled. But even that pain did not wake her dulled
senses.
Back in her room, Lisbell tossed and turned, unable to sleep
for a long time. The late night eventually gave way to dawn,
and then to daylight.
It was a night that felt like being bewitched by something
unknown. There was no other reason for her to be so
restless. Her inexplicably disturbed mind tormented her
inside and out.
Yes, it was truly a tormenting sensation.
Since she couldn’t sleep anyway, Lisbell got up early and
hastily prepared to leave. Her mother, who started work at
seven o’clock sharp, came to her room to see her off. Her
mother looked surprised to see her daughter already up and
ready.
Holding her luggage, Lisbell followed her mother out of the
villa. Her gaze, which had become accustomed to the
garden in just two weeks, stopped at one spot. It was the
outdoor swimming pool, emptied for cleaning. She recalled
the image of transparent water droplets splashing.
“Lisbell?”
“Yes, let’s go.”
She snapped back to reality and hurried her steps. At the
gate, barely open enough for a person to pass, she briefly
hugged her mother.
“Call me as soon as you’re ready. I’ll come to Misley.”
Her mother coughed briefly.
Worried, Lisbell adjusted her mother’s shawl, wrapped
hastily due to the early hour.
“Yes, I will. But mother, are you okay?”
“Yes, it seems I caught a light cold due to the change of
seasons.”
“Don’t neglect it just because it’s light. Make sure to take
medicine, okay?”
“I will. You might miss your train. Go on.”
“I’ll call when I arrive.”
“Okay.”
After hugging her mother again, Lisbell glanced at the
garden. The pavilion’s aesthetic curves caught her eye,
making her flinch as if burned. Her mother, noticing
something strange, stepped back.
“I’ll be going now.”
Before her mother could ask anything, Lisbell quickly turned
and left, feeling like a fugitive rather than someone ending a
vacation. The lingering situation stuck in her mind like a
persistent stain.
The confusion of the night weighed heavily on her.

Having seen her daughter off safely, Mrs. Osborne began
her usual day.
Handling the tasks scheduled from seven in the morning
without delay, she went back to the gate to receive the mail
from the delivery boy.
Crossing the garden, she checked her pocket watch,
noticing there was still some time before noon.
Before heading to the master’s bedroom, Mrs. Osborne
stopped by the guest room where her daughter had stayed.
“Oh my.”
Knowing her daughter well, she expected the room to be
impeccably clean. Contrary to her expectations, the guest
room was still somewhat untidy, suggesting a hurried
departure.
With a small sigh, Mrs. Osborne took the opportunity to tidy
up the guest room.
She straightened the wrinkled bedspread, opened the halfclosed window to air the room, and folded the towels in the
bathroom. Turning around, she noticed a light pink blouse
hanging on a golden hanger.
“How distracted must she have been?”
What could have made her rush so?
Pondering the situation, she took the blouse and draped it
over her arm.
After tidying up, it was nearly noon. She left the room and
walked down the corridor to the master’s bedroom.
A sudden fit of coughing bent Mrs. Osborne’s back like an
old woman’s. The persistent cough painfully rattled her
lungs and throat.
Leaning against the window sill, she noticed blood in her
spit. The metallic taste spread under her nose. Her head felt
dizzy. She stood still, leaning against the window.
At least her daughter hadn’t seen this.
Whenever Lisbell asked if she was unwell, her heart sank
but she managed to pull herself together.
Not yet.
If Lisbell found out, she would feel compelled to take care of
her.
“I still want to be close to you, Mother.”
Her daughter, who couldn’t imagine her having any health
issues, already made such endearing proposals. If she knew
about her condition, she would insist even more on taking
care of her. 
Lisbell had always been that way.
She would pick pretty flowers from the hill to show her
mother, got good grades without burdening the family
financially by not mentioning college, and during college,
she always called on the same day, at the same time, to
check in and share updates.
What the monastery deemed a sinful existence was a
source of pride for Mrs. Osborne. She too wished to spend
her remaining years with her daughter but didn’t want to be
a burden.
Her daughter had grown up wonderfully despite her
inadequacies as a mother. She didn’t want to be a burden
any longer. Discovering the warning signs of her health
issues was fortunate.
Her dizziness cleared a bit. Mrs. Osborne straightened up,
realizing she had spent more time than expected, and
hurried her steps.
Seeing that the church bell hadn’t rung yet, it seemed it
wasn’t noon. The master’s bedroom would still be as quiet
as a night with a crescent moon.
With this thought, she opened the door.
“….”
Unexpectedly, the master was already awake.
Leaning against the window with a cigarette, he gazed
outside. The church bell still hadn’t rung.
The master had risen before the church bell rang
“You’re up early.”
Mrs. Osborne left a brief indication of her presence for her
master, who seemed lost in thought and didn’t even glance
in her direction. She headed towards the desk, placed the
mail she had brought with her on one side, and picked up a
paper knife.
Ssssh, ssssh.
The sharp edge of the knife made a slicing sound as it cut
through the paper.
Even after completing her task, the master continued to
stare out the window. Only now did she become curious
about what he was looking at so intently.
Could there be a problem outside?
Mrs. Osborne followed his gaze with her own.
Despite this, her curiosity remained unsatisfied. All she
could see in the direction he was staring was the pavilion in
the garden. The man was intently observing this ordinary
structure, as if expecting to find something or someone
unusual there.
“Madam.”
“Yes, master.”
“Has Lisbell woken up?”
He asked soon after.
“Yes, she left the villa early this morning.”
Ulrich finally turned around.
“She’s already gone?”
“Yes. I heard she said her farewells to you yesterday.”
“Farewells….”
He laughed.
For some reason, the face he showed her was chilling.
“Yes, she’s gone….”
He stubbed out the cigarette he hadn’t even properly
smoked in the ashtray. His hand brushed his platinum blond
hair. At that moment, the distant sound of church bells
began to ring.
“What would you like for breakfast?”
“I’m not really hungry. Just some coffee, perhaps….”
As Ulrich walked to the desk, he glanced at Mrs. Osborne.
Today, his gaze felt particularly warm as it passed over her
face and moved to her wrist.
Then he suddenly stopped.
“…That.”
“Pardon?”
Mrs. Osborne grew tense at her master’s sudden reaction.
He was pointing at the blouse draped over her arm.
“Oh, I was just tidying up the guest room where my
daughter stayed. She seemed to have forgotten it in the
bathroom in her haste to get ready this morning, so I
brought it with me.”
Expecting this explanation to suffice, she noticed his gaze
still lingering. It was as if he were trying to dissect the
pavilion in the garden earlier.
“Master?”
“Leave that here.”
“Pardon?”
Ulrich tapped the desk.
Mrs. Osborne hesitated, unsure of how to respond. She
glanced between the blouse on her arm and her master’s
face.
Meanwhile, Ulrich was examining the stack of mail. He was
a man who, despite his capricious nature, always followed
through on his decisions. His current demeanor made it
clear that his earlier request was sincere.
…This?
Why?
Although curious, questioning him would be out of place.
Her duty was to follow his instructions without complaint.
Mrs. Osborne placed the blouse on the desk.
“I’ll bring you some coffee and a light brunch. Coffee on an
empty stomach can be unsettling.”
“Fine.”
Mrs. Osborne left the room, closing the door behind her.
Alone, Ulrich pulled out the chair attached to the desk. He
sat down, crossing his legs, and set aside the mail he had
been reading.
He tilted his head slightly. The blouse lay on the desk like a
discarded skin. He reached out and touched the limp sleeve.
It was a bright, sunny day, but a breeze that seemed fit for
nightfall swept through his fingers.
He didn’t need to look far.
It was last night.
Last night was replaying at the tips of his fingers.

Ulrich propped his chin on his hand and played with the
sleeve for a long time. His eyes didn’t see the blouse; they
were looking at something beyond it. It was as if he were
recalling a memory.
He remembered the moment he was blocked.
That same restraint had stopped him from impulsively
kissing her.
Ulrich slowly stood up. Still holding the sleeve, the blouse
hung limply from his hand like a dead body.
He spread the thin fabric out on the desk.
It matched. Lisbell had worn this when she came to the
pavilion last night.
“Hmm.”
He took a shallow breath.
“She seemed to have forgotten it in her haste to get ready
this morning, so I brought it with me.”
Mrs. Osborne had explained, somewhat bewildered. Ulrich
himself didn’t see Lisbell as someone who would carelessly
leave her clothes behind. As someone who aspired to be a
teacher, she seemed to have a meticulous and thorough
nature.
So, she must have been so agitated that she left her clothes
behind.
“Then it makes even less sense.”
Being agitated means being shaken, doesn’t it?
It meant that the strange atmosphere of last night wasn’t
something only he had felt. It wasn’t just his solitary
tension. The electrifying atmosphere that felt like it would
collapse with a single misstep was something both he and
she experienced.
But it was blocked.
Despite being captivated by the atmosphere, Lisbell had
rejected him.
And then she fled.
Leaving traces behind, like this.
This was a first in Ulrich’s life.
Being pitied by a mere commoner, and being rejected so
insultingly by such a wretched being.
He slowly lowered his hand.
Despite her conservative habits, the buttons of her blouse
had been fastened all the way to the top. Ulrich’s fingers
played with the topmost button. Then, suddenly, he flicked
it open.
The neckline opened easily. As he gazed down at the
unresisting fabric, he finally understood the source of the
discomfort he had been feeling since last night.
Ah, this is what I wanted to do.
“It’s Lisbell!”
It was just as she was about to step into the orphanage with
its wooden nameplate.
One of the children gathered in a small flowerbed turned her
head and shouted. The lively announcement caused the
children to jump up and rush over to Lisbell.
“Yes, yes. I’m back. Have you all been well?”
Lisbell crouched down to meet the children’s eyes, calling
each one by name. The named children’s cheeks blushed
with lively hues. They all clamored to speak at once, making
it difficult to understand them, but their joy was
unmistakable.
Only then did she feel like she was truly back in Misley. And
the little ones who made her feel this way were incredibly
endearing. Moments like these made her proud of her
dream to take care of children.

Her hand, which had been caressing a child’s cheek,
paused.
A sudden thought came to mind.
“Being a teacher doesn’t suit you, Lisbell.”
At the time, she had dismissed it lightly. But now, as it
resurfaced, it seemed she hadn’t entirely let it go.
Why did he say such a thing to me?
When she heard it, she had been more curious than
offended and had even asked why he thought that. He had
simply laughed and asked why she thought he would think
that, leaving the matter unresolved.
Lisbell was still curious about the reason.
But part of her didn’t want to know.
She was afraid.
In her life, the harsh reality she had to face repeatedly
involved financial issues. During this vacation, she had
unexpectedly met the wealthiest man in Rechem. To Lisbell,
money was the most daunting problem, which this man
effortlessly resolved and even used as a tool.
Perhaps because of that, he seemed like a god with absolute
power to her.
And what about Marnia, where he resided?
It was like a flawless fairy tale setting.
That’s what she had thought.
But her perspective had shifted slightly.
It wasn’t a fairy tale. Marnia was just an ordinary small
town. There must be people struggling day by day, just like
herself. It couldn’t be a dazzling fairy tale for everyone.
Only one person could experience such enchantment.
Paradise.
In other words, it was Ulrich’s paradise.
Sometimes lazy, sometimes diligent.
Changing one’s behavior according to one’s desires,
enjoying an economic freedom that others can hardly attain,
naturally accepting the luxuries that come with it, and
purely owning the background created by that luxury for
oneself.
No matter how you look at it, isn’t he like a god enjoying a
beautiful paradise?
Perhaps that’s why when he says something, it feels like an
absolute mark will be stamped deep inside. Hearing why he
said she wasn’t suited to being a teacher, she was secretly
afraid that it would harden her consciousness in that
direction.
“…Lisbell?”
She heard her name from afar. When she looked up, her
fiancé, Theodore, whom she hadn’t seen in about two
weeks, was standing there. He must have come out to see
what the commotion was about and found this scene.
Lisbell gave him a bright smile. Theodore, who had been
standing frozen as if he saw something he shouldn’t, came
running with a radiant smile like the children a moment ago.
“When did you get here? Why did you come so early? I
thought I wouldn’t see you until the afternoon.”
“I woke up early and took the first train.”
“I see… Let me carry your luggage.”
Theodore extended his arm. When Lisbell tried to hand it
over, the children playfully clung to the suitcase. Theodore
laughed heartily and then pretended to be stern.
“You rascals. Lisbell has just returned from a trip. She must
be very tired. Should you be bothering her like this?”
Nooo. The children replied, their mouths like little beaks
pecking. Theodore’s playful scolding spread waves of
laughter. Amidst the laughter, Lisbell followed Theodore
through the children as he grabbed her wrist and led her
away.
Fortunately, another teacher came out soon, having noticed
the commotion. Lisbell greeted and informed her of her
arrival, then headed to the dormitory with Theodore.
The room was filled with familiar sights: an old bed with a
wooden frame, a table with chipped paint, and a small vase
on the shabby windowsill. Seeing these familiar sights made
her feel at ease. It felt like she had returned to her proper
place. The guest room she stayed in at Marnia was
luxurious, but it always felt awkward and burdensome.
Once inside the room alone, Theodore pulled Lisbell close.
His tender kiss on her palm made Lisbell smile softly.
“I thought I was dreaming for a moment. Seeing your lovely
hair in the sunlight like a cloud…”
“Didn’t you expect me today?”
“I told you earlier! I thought you’d arrive in the afternoon. It
feels like I’ve received a surprise gift. Look, my heart is still
racing.”
He placed her hand on his chest. Lisbell, thinking he was
just expressing his happiness at seeing her sooner than
expected, felt the slightly faster rhythm of his heartbeat
through her palm.
Lisbell’s eyes widened like a rabbit’s, and Theodore laughed
innocently like a boy.
“So, did you have a good trip?”
“Yeah.”
“I’m sorry to hear you couldn’t persuade your mother.”
“Mother’s will was too strong.”
“But I understand her too. The villa is so spacious and
beautiful.”
Lisbell nodded while opening her suitcase on the bed.
Theodore perched beside her, his eyes sparkling.
“Come to think of it, you haven’t told me about that
person.”
“That person?”
“The owner of the villa. The nobleman of Altahart.”
Lisbell’s hands paused as she took out clothes from the
suitcase. Theodore continued without noticing.
“He’s the one who invited you to Marnia, covered all your
expenses there, and even wanted your mother to continue
working. He doesn’t seem like a bad person.”

“How was he? Did he seem alright?”
“…Yes, he was kind.”
Lisbell gave a brief reply and continued hanging her clothes
in the closet. Theodore naturally helped her. Despite her
lukewarm response, Theodore kept talking about Altahart.
“What did he look like?”
“Huh?”
“After you left, I looked up the capital newspaper. He looked
quite handsome in the photos. Was he the same in person?”
The image of his appearance, etched in her memory like a
new shock, resurfaced.
“Yeah, he looked like his photos.”
Lisbell busied her hands aimlessly and replied shortly. Her
responses were continually curt.
“That’s incredible. Really? He’s got all that money and even
perfect looks? That’s so unfair.”
“Unfair… Oh?”
Lisbell looked around. Theodore, crossing his arms and
clicking his tongue, turned to her.
“What’s wrong?”
“I can’t find my blouse.”
She went to the bed and checked her luggage. She sighed
after searching through her belongings.
“I think I left it at the villa.”
“What kind of blouse?”
“A light pink one.”
“Oh, that one. Isn’t that your favorite?”
Theodore squinted sympathetically. It would have been
possible to retrieve it if it were nearby, but it was a whole
day’s train ride away. She had to reluctantly give up.
Theodore comforted her, suggesting they visit the town
square’s clothing shop together.
“More importantly, Lisbell, I have news for you.”
“News?”
“It has finally arrived. From Renbruck.”
Lisbell’s eyes widened.
Renbruck was Theodore’s hometown. There was only one
thing they could have sent.
The wedding dress they needed for their wedding.
The wedding venue was naturally decided to be the chapel
of the Misley Orphanage, where they first met.
Theodore’s parents were initially disappointed and tried to
persuade them to change their minds. But both Lisbell and
Theodore were firm. They were determined to have the
ceremony at the place where their relationship began.
His parents eventually conceded but insisted on sending the
wedding dress. It was the dress his mother wore when she
married his father, a timeless design.
Theodore had said they could get a new dress if she
preferred, but Lisbell liked the idea. She knew it was a
handmade piece crafted from expensive silk specifically for
his mother by the factory his father owned. It would be far
better than a hastily made dress.
Besides, she was also worried about the cost. It was
essential to make the wedding special, but spending so
much for one day was daunting.
So there was no reason to refuse the wedding dress from
Renbruck.
“There’s really not much time left now.”
Theodore’s excited voice echoed as he brushed back her
hair and cupped her cheek. The warmth of his hand, his
calm eyes, and his resolute voice filled with anticipation
transferred to her, making her lips quiver.
His fresh green eyes looked down at her. In the suddenly
serene atmosphere, he tilted his head sideways. Their
shadows lengthened on the windowsill, drawing closer.
“…Huh?”
Just before their lips met, Theodore sensed her pushing his
chest and opened his half-closed eyes. His puzzled voice
came out naturally.
Up close, Lisbell looked more surprised by her own actions.
“Ah, I… I just got here and haven’t washed yet….”
I might smell…. she added in a small voice. Theodore was
momentarily silent before bursting into laughter.
“What are you talking about? There’s no way you smell. And
even if you did, so what?”
“Still….”
“Alright, alright. I was being insensitive, keeping you up
when you’re tired.”
He sat her on the bed and kissed her forehead. Lisbell
closed her eyes slowly in his affectionate gesture.
“I’ll bring your dinner to your room later. Rest until then. I’ll
tell the director you came back in your place.”
“Yeah, thanks, Theo.”
“No need to thank me.”
Theo patted Lisbell’s shoulder once before leaving the room.
Lisbell, staring at the closed door, collapsed onto her back.
As she blankly stared at the ceiling, she raised her fingers to
her lips.
Why…
Pressing her plump lower lip, she belatedly felt a sense of
doubt.
Why at that moment…
When Theo tried to kiss her, Lisbell remembered blue-grey
eyes. No, they came to mind. It wasn’t intentional; it was
instinctual. And instincts couldn’t be controlled—they were
close to the subconscious.

The confusion she thought she’d shaken off on the train ride
back rushed over her again, as if she had been mistaken all
along.
In fact, this consciousness had been ongoing since earlier.
“…Yes. He’s a kind person.”
Kind, but strictly speaking, a bit precarious and somewhat
strange. He would make silly remarks that sometimes didn’t
sound like jokes, which was peculiar.
“Yeah, he looked like his picture.”
It was a lie.
The moment she saw him, she was inwardly amazed,
thinking he was incomparable to the photo. He was the
most strikingly beautiful person Lisbell had ever seen.
Thus, in front of Theodore, she tried to avoid mentioning
that man.
As if she were guilty of a crime.
She didn’t understand it.
Although there had almost been an incident at the pavilion
that day, ultimately, nothing happened. So, she had nothing
to hide. She hadn’t done anything improper with another
man while engaged to be married.
So why did she feel so uncomfortable?
As if she’d done something wrong and was hiding it like a
child. In reality, nothing had happened between her and
Ulrich, not even a minor incident, yet why…
Lisbell turned over to face the wall.
The fingers that had been hovering near her mouth touched
her neck softly.
The man’s gaze had first swept over her like a lick, then his
tie had been gently tied. Their eyes had met horizontally.
Though usually his eyes were drowsy, whenever he looked
intently, his clear, bright eyes would shimmer intensely.
When she couldn’t even breathe before the vast wave-like
gaze, the tied tie was pulled tight…
Her throat tickled.
It felt like a dull needle was pricking the base of her throat.
Lisbell slowly rubbed her chest.
It felt uncomfortable and anxious, as if something was
weighing on her.

“My goodness.”
Theo, who had been watching her with more concentration
than when he took his college exams, exclaimed purely.
Lisbell, feeling embarrassed for some reason, lowered her
head. Seeing the orphanage teacher laugh at Theo’s
transparent expression made her even more embarrassed.
It wasn’t anything special. He was reacting this way in front
of Lisbell, who was trying on a wedding dress.
“I thought an angel had descended.”
“Theo…”
When she hinted for him to refrain from such comments in
front of others, Theo chuckled before inspecting her
seriously.
“There’s no need for alterations. It suits you perfectly,
Lisbell.”
Theo, who had risen from the chapel’s pew, approached. He
was also dressed in a fitted black suit.
Lisbell clenched and unclenched her tingling hands.
Standing face to face in such attire, and in a chapel no less,
made it feel like the real ceremony was about to take place.
Even though she knew it wasn’t the actual event, she felt a
fresh wave of nervousness.
Above all, Theo’s unwavering gaze on her brought a
pleasant exhilaration.
A late-summer bride.
A phrase someone had left in her mind suddenly came to
her.
“Sorry to break the mood.”
The teacher who had helped with the dress fitting cleared
her throat.
“But the waist needs some alteration. Lisbell’s frame is
small, so even when tightened, there’s still a lot of room.
This doesn’t look nice, and it would be uncomfortable for
Lisbell. A visit to the dress shop is necessary.”
“Really?”
Theo, as if waking from a dream, responded quickly. While
they were talking, the teacher left to answer a call from
outside.
Left alone in the chapel, Theo quietly cleared his throat. He
seated Lisbell, who was holding up the hem of her long
dress, on a nearby chair.
“Theo?”
With a gentle hand, he lifted the hem of the dress. Her shoeclad foot rested on his knee. Theo removed the shoe.
Lisbell flinched slightly as her pale, round foot was exposed.
Theo smiled and lifted something. It was a white shoe,
matching the dress she was wearing. It fit her perfectly, as if
prepared for her.
“When did you…”
“I prepared it while you were away from Misley.”

“You said you’d wear what mother had, but I wanted to get
you something of your own.”
The pink jewel on the edge of the shoe sparkled. It reminded
her of the day he proposed.
It was the day they graduated from college.
Under the falling cherry blossom petals, he shyly but
confidently confessed that he wanted to spend the future
together.
Even then, it didn’t feel real. But now, it did. Her heart
pounded. It was no longer something distant; their wedding,
their future, and all the dreams they had envisioned
together during college were just around the corner.
“It reminds me of the old days.”
“The old days?”
Lisbell whispered, touching the shoes as she bent over.
“The day you carried me back to the orphanage.”
It was during a vacation when she stayed at the orphanage.
They hadn’t officially started dating then. Though they
hadn’t formally dated, it was clear from the atmosphere and
vibes that they had feelings for each other.
They had gone to the square together due to a lack of toys
at the orphanage. Lisbell had collided with a child running
from the opposite direction and fell, twisting her ankle.
Unable to stand due to the pain, Theo had bent one leg and
shown his back. A signal to get on.
That day, as she was carried on his back to the orphanage,
they were drenched in the red sunset. They officially
became a couple from that day.
“That time.”
Theo began nostalgically.
“I was surprised by how light you were.”
“Liar.”
“It’s true.”
“Then why were you sweating so much?”
“It was hot.”
It was a sweltering summer.
“Even though my whole body was sticky with sweat, I didn’t
feel bad, which was strange.”

“That’s when I knew. This must be love.”

“And I made up my mind. No matter what, I would marry
you.”
His voice, filled with conviction, was confident. When Lisbell
laughed, saying, “What’s that,” Theo jokingly furrowed his
brows, insisting he was serious. Soon, his leisurely gaze
scanned Lisbell’s appearance.
“Look. See what you’re wearing now.”

“A wedding dress.”

“Our wedding is right around the corner, Lisbell, just as I
wished.”
Theo was genuinely happy.
After changing her other shoe to the new one, he kissed her
slightly exposed instep. Before she could protest that it was
dirty, it was already done. When Lisbell’s hand pushed his
shoulder away, Theo laughed heartily.
His laughter burst like fireworks in the chapel.
The warm noon sunlight poured down on the two of them.
In the afternoon, they went to a dress shop near the square
to have the dress altered. Taking advantage of being out,
they bought gifts for the orphans, explored new shops, and
enjoyed a pleasant leisure time at a café terrace.
It was a smooth day.
Amongst it all, Lisbell felt a relief no one else knew.
The turmoil she had felt on the day she returned from her
holiday in Marnia had now mostly faded. She still didn’t
understand why she felt that way, but since it had subsided,
she saw no need to dwell on it.
Gas lamps along the street began to light up.
Walking along the brightened path, she and Theo returned
to the orphanage. Distributing the candies they had bought
as gifts to the children, Lisbell entered the orphanage.
“Lisbell, are you back now?”
“Yes, Director.”
Thanks to her frequent visits since college, the orphanage
director was fond of Lisbell and Theo. It was entirely for this
reason that they were allowed to hold their ceremony in the
chapel, which was not usually permitted for personal use.
“Is something wrong?”
“A letter arrived for you, Lisbell.”
“A letter?”
“Yes. I left it on the table in your room.”
“Thank you for letting me know.”
After thanking the director, Lisbell headed to her room. She
placed her belongings down and approached the table. For a
moment, she thought it might be from her mother, but then
she realized her mother would have called the orphanage
directly instead of using such a cumbersome method.
As she picked up the letter, Lisbell paused. There was a
government seal on the edge, indicating it was an official
document.
The sender was from Marnia.
Lisbell hurriedly opened the envelope.
Her purple eyes quickly scanned the contents.
The official document was concise, with each paragraph
succinctly detailing the facts. A theft incident had occurred
in Marnia, and the local police were handling it. Helen
Osborne had been identified as a suspect and was currently
detained, with plans to bring her to trial in the capital. The
notice urging the procurement of legal representation was
brutally straightforward.
In essence, it meant her mother was involved in a theft
case. Not as a victim, but as the perpetrator.
It was a bolt from the blue. Lisbell reread the lines, unable
to comprehend what she was seeing. But no matter how
many times she read it, the meaning didn’t change. It
consistently conveyed the same information, wreaking
havoc in her mind.
“What is this….”
It made no sense.
Her mother, a thief?
Impossible. The mother she knew would never commit such
an act. Before she had Lisbell, she was a devout believer,
living an honest life. Even after being expelled from the
convent for having Lisbell, her mother had maintained her
integrity as a devout person.

Lisbell felt momentarily dizzy.
Was it three days ago? They had spoken on the phone about
the upcoming wedding expenses. When Lisbell complained
about the unexpected costs, her mother had expressed
concern.
Could it be…?
Lisbell quickly left the room, headed to the director’s office,
and asked to use the phone. But no matter how many times
she dialed, she couldn’t get through. As her eyes anxiously
darted around, she read the part of the letter stating that
the suspect was detained.
That meant her mother wasn’t at the Marnia villa. Realizing
this, Lisbell’s hand holding the receiver dropped.
What in the world was going on?
She had no way of knowing if her mother had actually done
such a thing. If it were true, what had she stolen to warrant
such a trial? If it were all a misunderstanding, how had she
ended up in this predicament? Lisbell had no way of finding
out.
At least, not in Misley.
Her mind racing, Lisbell returned to her room. She opened
her bag and quickly packed her things. Theodore, who had
come to ask if she would be having dinner, was surprised to
see his fiancée suddenly preparing to leave.
“Lisbell? What are you doing?”
“Theo, I think I need to go to Marnia for a bit.”
“What? What are you talking about?”
As she packed her small bag, Lisbell sighed. She hesitated
before handing Theodore the letter. Reading it quickly,
Theodore was as stunned as Lisbell had been.
“What is this…. Mrs. Osborne, you mean….”
“My mother would never do something so foolish.”
“Of course not! I believe that too. But did you try calling?”
“Yes. But… I couldn’t get through.”
Lisbell sighed deeply.
“I don’t know what’s going on, but I need to go to Marnia to
find out.”
“Right, of course…. Are you sure you’ll be okay alone?
Should I come with you?”
Despite being just as shaken, Theodore offered his help.
Lisbell gave him a faint smile and shook her head.
“No, I’ll go alone. It won’t take long.”
“Alright. Let me know as soon as you find out anything.”
Nodding, Lisbell hurried to the train station.
Far off, the sun was slowly setting.

Lisbell took a deep breath as she stepped off the carriage in
front of the path. Pushing through the small wooded area,
she soon saw part of the imposing villa.
It feels so different.
When she had walked this path before, she had been filled
with a vague excitement of being in a new city. Now, the
serene scenery didn’t register as her mind was in turmoil.
Not just that, it felt heavy and burdensome. Each step
seemed to add more weight to her feet.
Her fingers instinctively curled.

She finally reached the front of the villa.
Lisbell was taken aback. When she had visited with her
mother on vacation, the iron gate had been tightly shut.
Now, it was wide open as if welcoming someone.
She unfolded the paper she held. Having looked at it
countless times on the way here, the edges were curled,
and there were creases all over. Lisbell quickly glanced at
the address written on it.
“Rather than here, why don’t you try the villa?”
Before coming here, Lisbell had already been to the Marnia
police station.
“The key issue in cases like this often comes down to
leniency. Since the victim is the employer of Helen Osborne,
it might be a good idea to meet them directly and seek their
leniency. If the victim agrees, the police can close the case
without it going to trial.”
Judging by the investigator’s demeanor, it seemed the theft
had indeed occurred. If so, the suggestion wasn’t entirely
misplaced. If all these circumstances were true, Ulrich’s
leniency could resolve everything.
“Haah….”
The investigator had sent her to the villa, and the once
tightly shut gate was now wide open. It felt like she was
being invited into a well-orchestrated stage, making her
uneasy.
Lisbell swallowed hard and stepped through the gate.
Due to the summer that had quietly crept in over the past
month, the garden was filled with blue Queen of night
flowers. The topiary, sculptures, and garden arches were
adorned with contrasting red roses in full bloom.
The vibrant colors were almost overwhelming.
But perhaps that was just a narrow perspective.
Paradise.
Was this really paradise?
To Ulrich, this was probably just one of the many villas his
family owned. From what she had read in the newspapers,
his family owned over twenty second houses across the
country.
And most importantly, there was the capital.
A hotbed of gossip and culture.
The center of industrial advancement.
The pinnacle of high society where prominent families
gathered.
To Lisbell, Marnia had always been a place of admiration,
seen through the frame of a beautiful painting. If even this
place felt so impressive, what would the far more advanced
capital be like?
It must be even more splendid and magnificent.
And Ulrich would undoubtedly wield significant influence
there. In the center of a city driven by business, his solid
wealth and power would hold great sway.
Ultimately, both here and there were his paradises.
Her long musings returned to the harsh reality. The thought
of seeking leniency from such a formidable person left a
bitter taste in her mouth. Lisbell was like a small pond
compared to the vast ocean that was Ulrich.
But still…. There might be a chance.
She recalled her meeting with Ulrich a month ago. Although
he had his peculiarities, he was generally a man of mild
demeanor. His mannerisms were refined, and his language
and expressions carried the typical poise of a noble.
Despite their strained relationship, he didn’t seem like
someone who would mercilessly drive a person away.
…Or would he?
No matter how much she pondered, it was meaningless. She
had to confront him to get any answers.
With this resolve, she clenched her fist.
“Who are you?”
Lisbell stopped in her tracks. She saw a black sedan parked
next to the fountain. The voice belonged to a man standing
in front of the car. He had neatly groomed hair as black as
obsidian.
The face wasn’t unfamiliar. While he might not know her,
she recognized him. He was the man who had been
watching Ulrich practice shooting in the villa’s courtyard.
She had assumed he was Ulrich’s secretary.
The recollection existed solely for Lisbell. Naturally, the
man’s scrutinizing gaze made sense as he sized up the
unfamiliar intruder. Realizing this, Lisbell quickly bowed.
“Hello. I’m Lisbell Osborne.”
“Osborne?”
The man furrowed his brow.
His gaze fixed on her innocent face before he let out a small
exclamation of realization.
That wasn’t all. He lifted his hand from the car, tousling his
neatly groomed hair, and glanced somewhere in the villa,
his eyes narrowing as if encountering a bothersome
situation.
Lisbell, who had been puzzled, soon became terrified.
If this man was indeed Ulrich’s secretary, he might have
handled the theft that occurred here.
Could that be why he was acting this way?
Could it be why he shuddered at the mere mention of the
suspect’s name, ‘Osborne’?
Having not yet met Ulrich, Lisbell felt that the reaction of
this man, presumed to be his secretary, mirrored Ulrich’s
own. It was a situation that naturally instilled fear of
repercussions.
“I am Victor Loisden. I currently work under Master
Altahart.”
The man’s complexion changed in an instant. With an
emotionless expression, as if all feelings had been washed
away, he introduced himself and extended his hand for a
handshake.
“I have been waiting for you. Please follow me, I will guide
you.”
Although he didn’t seem like someone who had been
waiting, Lisbell silently followed Victor.
The corridor they walked through was quiet. It felt like an
invisible weight was pressing down on her. She knew she
needed to ask the secretary various questions to properly
understand the situation, but she couldn’t bring herself to
speak.
The only difference from the last time was not just the
atmosphere she felt.
Her position.
Her position in coming here had completely reversed.
From a guest to an unwelcome visitor.
Lisbell anxiously bit her lip, feeling like her clean neck was
exposed.
Victor stopped walking after a while. They were in front of a
large double door. He opened one of the doors and stepped
inside. Lisbell hesitantly followed his shadow.
The interior was closer to a reception room. The curtains
swayed in the open window. A gentle breeze blew in like the
breath of nature from afar.
Amid such a serene scene, there he was.
Ulrich Altahart.
She swallowed hard, feeling like the saliva stuck in her
throat was poison. It felt like evidence, burning her throat.
“Master, Miss Lisbell Osborne is here to see you.”
His platinum-blonde hair moved slightly, as if he had been
looking at some documents.
Sitting on the sofa, Ulrich turned to the door. Victor Loisden
took a step back and bowed his head as he saw Ulrich
acknowledging this.
“Then I will leave.”
“No need for tea.”
“Yes, sir.”
Just as there was no embellishment in the words announcing
her arrival, Victor left the reception room without any
unnecessary actions. Left alone in an instant, Lisbell wiped
the sweat from her palms on her skirt.
“You’ve come, Lisbell.”
A low voice addressed her, but she couldn’t lift her head,
her mind in turmoil. His tone was as calm as when they
parted ways.
Gathering her courage, Lisbell looked up.
At a glance, his expression seemed the same. Despite
harboring the family of someone who stole from him,
Ulrich’s face showed no strong emotion. It was calm and
moderate, like the surface of a lake. Even after a long look,
she could not find any sign of anger or irritation.
“Why don’t you come over here instead of standing there?”
He gestured with his head, his neck probably stiff from
looking her way. Lisbell quickly moved her feet.
She carefully sat on the multi-person sofa beside him. As
usual, documents were piled around him. Ulrich placed the
document he was holding on top of the pile and rubbed the
back of his neck. His relaxed demeanor, in stark contrast to
her nervousness, tightened her insides.
“I received the letter on my way here.”
Ulrich, crossing one leg over the other, gave her a listening
look. Encouraged by this, Lisbell forced her stiff tongue to
move.
“They say my mother has committed… some wrong.”
“Hmm.”
He extended a finger from the hand supporting his chin and
tapped his cheek.
“It’s a simple story. A few days ago, a ring kept in my
bedroom disappeared. It was a ring my mother meticulously
designed and ordered when I came of age.”
“…”
“It’s practically an antique to me now, something I rarely
wear… but it’s still quite valuable, so I couldn’t just ignore
its disappearance. So, I ordered a search of the villa.”
“…”
“Guess where it was found?”
Though posed as a question, it was not really one. With the
answer so obvious, it couldn’t be considered a question.
“Oddly enough, it was in Mrs. Osborne’s wardrobe.”
Lisbell’s fingers curled on her lap. Her skirt was pulled and
wrinkled like her troubled mind.
“My mother…”
Her tongue, even stiffer than before, moved reflexively, but
she couldn’t continue speaking. Her mind was swirling. An
overwhelming confusion was like a storm cloud.
As Lisbell struggled to speak, Ulrich calmly added.
“To be honest, I didn’t intend for things to escalate this
much. Would I, who came here to escape the noise of the
capital, really blow this out of proportion over a missing
ring? It’s more of a hassle for me, too.”
“…”
“But in our family, the principle is to report everything to the
household. Anything that happens within my vicinity must
be reported to the main house. That’s how my mother heard
about it. She’s the type who needs to take action on
anything, so things turned out this way.”
No wonder.
Despite it being a minor theft compared to a grave crime
like murder, talk of a trial in the capital had already
surfaced.
Punishing a servant for attempting to steal from the master,
if it was a family matter, wasn’t impossible. His family was
no ordinary one. To clear her foggy mind, Lisbell dug her
nails into her palm.
“My mother…”
“…”
“May I see her?”
Ulrich wiggled the foot of his crossed leg.
Lisbell glanced up and met his gaze.
A cold wind brushed past.
It wasn’t the breeze coming through the open window. It
was the enigmatic gaze she had seen under the starry sky
of the pavilion at night. His eyes were calm, yet they evoked
a tension as if they might snap at any moment.
Her heart pounded. Feeling guilty, she quickly lowered her
gaze.
“I believe there is some misunderstanding. The mother I
know would never do such a thing.”
“Hmm. People are multi-faceted, Lisbell. There’s a reason
they are described as three-dimensional beings.”
“…”
“A desire hidden from her daughter might have manifested
differently. Isn’t that possible?”
Snap, the center of the hope she had held shattered.
“Frankly, I am quite disappointed. Although I didn’t know
Mrs. Osborne well, I believed she was diligent and honest.
Not only that, but she was also neat and perceptive… It’s
infuriating the more I think about it.”
As he continued speaking, Lisbell felt any chance of leniency
from the him slipping away.
Of course, it was understandable. He had raised her
mother’s salary for her good work, even covered the
expenses for her daughter’s stay here, only to be betrayed
like this. Ulrich’s indignation was entirely justified.
Yet, it still didn’t make sense to her.
Even amidst the rapidly unfolding situation, Lisbell’s faith in
her mother remained unwavering. It was built over a long
time and couldn’t be shattered in a moment. That was their
relationship and their love.
Lisbell closed her eyes tightly and then opened them.
“Somehow, just once, even briefly, could you allow me to
speak with my mother…?”
Instead of responding, Ulrich leisurely smiled and tilted his
head. Despite using words like disappointment and
infuriating, his demeanor was playful. Yet, his gaze
remained probing. It felt like she was being examined under
a predator’s sharp claws. Every nerve in her body felt on
edge.
“I want to hear about the situation directly from her. The
mother I know is not a greedy person. Even if she had
desires, she wouldn’t achieve them through unjust
means…!”
“Does that mean….”
The low voice that flowed like water cut off Lisbell’s protest.
“Are you saying I’m lying?”
Startled, Lisbell straightened up.
The temperature in his gaze dropped. His cold stare felt like
a dagger digging into her.
Goosebumps rose all over my body. It was a slip of the
tongue caused by the chaos. Regardless, it was my fault. In
a position where I had to plead for mercy, I was guilty no
matter what attitude the man took.
Lisbell was frozen and couldn’t move for a while, then she
finally stirred.
Ulrich’s eyes fell solemnly. They followed the woman as she
knelt beneath the sofa.
He raised an eyebrow with interest.
“That’s not what I meant. I couldn’t believe my mother did
such a thing… If I offended you, I sincerely apologize.”
“Try.”
“…Pardon?”
“Apologize.”
The tip of his pointed shoe wavered. Kneeling before him,
Ulrich’s shoe was near Lisbell’s face. If it swung wrongly, it
could hit her ear. It suddenly served as a means to prove his
and her positions, and the darkness grew before her eyes.
“Come to think of it, those pretty lips have never apologized
before.”

“Didn’t you come here to beg for my mercy?”
He pressed coldly with eyes that had turned icy, questioning
how she could even think of not moving her lips in
supplication.
His behavior was generally dignified, and his tone was calm
and deliberate, never hurried or excited. Ulrich was still
Ulrich. Like a statue stimulating aesthetic consciousness, he
was beautiful and refined.
Yet, she couldn’t understand why he felt so vulgar. The
invisible force emanating from him made her lungs ache as
if they were being squeezed.
“I’m… I’m sorry.”

“I’m truly sorry. It pains me that I can only express this in
such a pitiful manner. I sincerely apologize. I’m really sorry
to have caused you unnecessary trouble over such a
matter.”
Her voice trembled. Instinctive fear gnawed at her hands
and feet. Lisbell wanted to grovel on the floor and beg if she
could. She could actually do so. She could do it repeatedly if
it could smooth over this situation.
While Lisbell’s delicate voice shook like a trembling aspen in
her apology, Ulrich observed her with calm eyes.
The man’s beautifully grown eyelashes fluttered. His eyelids
blinked slowly, giving the impression of drowsiness, yet the
focus in his pupils was too sharp for that. They seemed to
hold a bluish glint, as if on the edge of anger.
Lisbell felt every bit of his intensely focused gaze on her
skin. She thought rolling over a bed of thorns would be
better than this. The coldness settled into her like a wound
that bled all over her body.
She didn’t understand.
Why she kept feeling this chilling sense of foreboding….
DongAt that moment, the sound of a large bell covered the
drawing room where the two were seated.
The sound of a church bell.
Before they knew it, the time had shifted from morning to
afternoon.
The shadows of the two people lying on the floor grew
longer. Lisbell couldn’t even lift her head and traced only
their shadows. Before the bell finished ringing, Ulrich rose
from the sofa. His shoe, which had been threateningly
hovering in the air, was now placed right next to Lisbell’s
hand on the floor.
Although there was some distance between them, the sense
of oppression made it feel like the sole of that shoe was
pressing her down with an unbearable weight.
“Do you want to save your mother?”
Lisbell lifted her bowed head. The man standing right in
front of her was looking down at her arrogantly.
The deafening bell sound rang in and out like a tinnitus.
Reality seemed to drift far away.
“…Yes.”
“How much?”

“How much do you want to save her?”
It was a strange question.
But she had to answer. Instinct told her so. Lisbell hastily
moved her dry tongue.
“Enough to try everything I can…”
“Hmm.”

“So, you’ll do anything.”
The man pulled his chin back and smiled. Unfortunately, the
backlight made it impossible to read his expression except
for his smiling lips. Lisbell stared up at him, trying to read
the emotions behind it.
She soon realized she didn’t need to.
Ulrich bent down and grabbed Lisbell’s chin. The grayish
backlight that had cast over his face disappeared, replaced
by the bright noon light.
But that light was murky.
The light that should have been radiant and brilliant from
the sun was inexplicably gloomy.
Soon, she realized.
It wasn’t the sunlight that was murky and gloomy.
“…Hmph!”
It was the moment the bell tolled twelve times, like the final
judgment.
His lips pressed against hers.
Lisbell’s eyes widened as if they would pop out.
Instinctively, she tried to push him away, but Ulrich, who
had anticipated this, overpowered her with his dominant
strength. Her body toppled backward without resistance.
The sensation of her vision flipping was similar to the world
turning upside down. Above her, his much larger frame
loomed.
“Ah!”
Ulrich’s tongue invaded her open mouth. The wet flesh
fumbled inside her lips. The realization that another man’s
tongue, not her fiancé’s, was stirring her insides made her
body go numb with shock.
“Hmph! Urgh…!”
As soon as she grasped the situation, she raised her arms to
push against his chest. But Ulrich didn’t budge.
On the contrary, he chuckled as if amused by her futile
resistance and adjusted his grip to make it easier to suck on
her chin. When she shook her head to shake off his hand,
his grip on her jawbone tightened as if to break it. A painful
groan escaped as her cheeks were crushed.
From then on, he was completely absorbed in the kiss,
tilting his head to deepen it. He chewed her flesh until it
swelled, then slipped his tongue in to explore her palate.
Every time his tongue brushed against Lisbell’s, which was
trembling in shock, he rubbed against it more firmly. Their
saliva thickened, hotly wetting each other’s mouths. Her
throat grew moist, while her chest turned cold.
“Mm… Urgh…!”
Lisbell’s legs lifted and her skirt slid down as she lay
sprawled on the floor. Ulrich’s fingers naturally followed the
path her skirt had taken. Shivers ran down Lisbell’s spine as
his fingers grasped her knee and slid up to the inside of her
thigh.
“Ugh, mm…!”
She struggled fiercely, but overcoming his strength was
impossible. Her violent movements hit the table, causing it
to shake. A stack of papers on it tumbled over the two of
them.
That was the moment Ulrich removed his mercilessly glued
lips from hers.
He pushed himself up with his forearms on either side of
Lisbell, licking his lips as if savoring a taste. It was a gesture
as if he were relishing the flavor of some food.
“Ah, as I thought.”
Thud.
Lisbell’s body, which had been heaving to catch her breath,
stiffened. Something pressed and rubbed against the inside
of her thighs. A man’s crotch occupied the space between
them. Unable to turn her gaze to it, Ulrich smiled a fragrant
smile at her.
“This is it.”

“This is what I wanted.”
There was an overwhelming heat in his voice, making it
difficult for Lisbell to handle. Trying to calm her wildly
beating heart, she spoke hesitantly.
“Are you… perhaps drunk…?”
“I haven’t touched a drop of alcohol today.”

“I’m completely sober.”
He played with Lisbell’s gray hair sprawled on the floor and
then lowered himself again. As his face came close again,
Lisbell shrank back. He chuckled and changed his direction.
His lips curved generously as they touched Lisbell’s ear.
“One more thing.”

“I was perfectly sober that day too.”
Thump Thump Thump.
Her heartbeat was so vivid she feared it might burst out of
her mouth.
Lisbell slowly turned her eyes toward him from where they
had been staring into space. His slightly relaxed eyes
glowed with a wild intensity, staring sharply at her.
Yes, this is it.
This was the ominous feeling I had.
Unlike Lisbell, who was frozen as if bound by invisible ropes,
Ulrich was like a free bird. He was a hawk capable of
catching and devouring a mouse that only knew how to run
away.
His lower body, which had been rubbing and pressing
against her legs as if to make his presence known, slid
further into the intimate space between her thighs. His
groin, which had swollen considerably, now completely
interlocked with her crotch.
Then, he thrust his hips.
With that light movement, Lisbell flinched, her eyelids
trembling. Ulrich, ensuring their lower bodies stayed
connected, rubbed his clothed manhood against her,
bringing his lips to her neck.
“No… Ugh, don’t, Ulrich…!”
Lisbell begged, struggling like an animal caught in a trap.
“Please, don’t do this. Don’t…”

“No, please. Don’t…! I’m getting married soon!”
Her pleas poured out desperately. It had to be that way.
Ulrich, who was now overtly driven by rising lust, seemed
ready to go all the way right here.
Chapter 23.
Lisbell’s eyes welled up with transparent tears out of sheer
fear. Meanwhile, the pressure sucking on her neck was
intense.
“Ulrich! Please, I have… Ah! I have someone who promised
me a future…!”
In the midst of her breaking sobs, Theodore’s bright, smiling
face flashed in her mind.
It was driving her crazy. Regret kept washing over her.
She should have just accepted Theodore’s offer to come
with her. She should have come to Marnia with him. If she
had done that, she wouldn’t be in this situation now…
“Ugh…”
Suddenly, a soft laugh echoed in her ear.
Lisbell, with tear-drenched eyes, turned her head clumsily.
Ulrich, unable to completely stifle his laughter, lifted his
head from her neck.
Lisbell stared at him in horror.
She was crushed under the weight of despair, caught
between hell and reality, while Ulrich bore a nonchalant
smile, causing a mild dizziness. If she had been standing,
she might have staggered.
“Is this about keeping your premarital chastity no matter
what?”
“…”
“My goodness. Lisbell, you’re living centuries ago. Who
cares about that these days?”
Still unable to contain his laughter, he chuckled
intermittently even as he spoke.
Lisbell, pinned under his sleek but undeniably intimidating
frame, feared what new danger might arise from this
sudden pause.
Ulrich’s fingers brushed up Lisbell’s slender neck. A red
bruise, freshly left by his lips, lay there like the seed of sin.
“I’ve changed my mind.”
Each word he dropped felt like a signal of impending doom
to Lisbell. Her throat tightened, making her swallow bitterly.
She stiffened her cheeks.
“You asked for my mercy, didn’t you?”
“…”
“Then come to the room next to the study.”
“But that’s…”
“That’s my bedroom.”
He got up from his position. Lisbell, as if her mind had shortcircuited, lay on the floor staring at the ceiling. It was only
moments later that she realized the weight pressing her
down was gone, and she scrambled to her feet.
In the meantime, Ulrich had returned to the sofa and lit a
cigarette. Despite his lower half still prominently aroused,
he smoked with an air of casualness. It was a skill to carry
such an appearance without seeming crude.
“What do you mean…”
Lisbell managed to ask as Ulrich exhaled a puff of smoke.
“It means come to me voluntarily.”
“…”
“Abandon your loyalty to your beloved fiancé and come to
me yourself.”
The darkness in his smile as he glanced at her seemed to
dim the sunlight itself.
Something dark and slimy lurked in his tone.
“I’m curious to see if your steadfast devotion can really do
that.”
It was like the saliva dripping from the tongue of a devil.

“I’ll wait patiently until sunset.”
“…”
“If you don’t come by then, I’ll consider that you’ve given up
on my mercy.”
Ulrich left the drawing room after leaving those words
behind, abandoning Lisbell, who had slumped down from
the chaotic situation.
Lisbell remained a statue until the scent of the cigarette he
had smoked faded away completely. The first thing she did
after regaining her senses was to hastily cover her exposed
neckline with trembling hands.
“Ha…”
A long sigh escaped her lips.
He had left, but his words lingered in her ears. Lisbell
rubbed her ears frantically, trying to erase them. But it was
in vain. Those words were etched in her mind, not her
hearing.
“To my bedroom.”
There was no way she could misunderstand the meaning. It
was an extension of the act that nearly happened here. He
intended to…
Lisbell abruptly stood up and forced her trembling legs to
move toward the door. She felt the cold touch of the
doorknob in her hand.
She had to grab it, open it, and leave.
She had to get out.
Just as the man who left without any hesitation, she too had
to leave without looking back.
But.
But if she did…
If she did, what would happen to her mother…?
The thoughts overlapped like a malfunctioning machine.
What would happen to her mother?
The answer appeared too clearly in her shaken mind.
Her mother would become a clear-cut criminal.
Is that all?
If the case escalated beyond the local police to the capital
court, she might have to hire a lawyer as her mother’s only
family.
Although she had never been involved in such matters, she
knew that lawyer fees weren’t something you could casually
mention. She didn’t have that kind of money. Even if she
did, it would be at the expense of the bright future she had
dreamt of with Theodore.
It would mean giving up her future.
But if she didn’t give up that future, her mother might end
up in prison. The opponent was the Altahart family. They
had the power to make her mother rot in jail for the rest of
her life for stealing a single ring.
Mercy.
No matter how she thought about it, that was the only
solution. It was the simplest and most effective way. One
word from Ulrich could end this situation quickly.
And the condition for that mercy…
Why?
A chilling question arose.
Why is this happening to me?
Unable to open the drawing room door, Lisbell slid down in
front of it. She barely supported herself with her palms on
the floor. The cold touch of the bare floor chilled her. Her
body and heart continued to cool.
She wanted to run away. Her heart pounded wildly, driving
her mad.
The image of Ulrich kissing her, the sensation of a stranger’s
weight crushing her, the slimy hot tongue licking her neck—
all of it was so vividly alive it was terrifying.
The ritual she had desperately avoided the night before she
left the pavilion had materialized.
Guilt…
The guilt of having done such a thing with another man,
despite being engaged to another, formed like ice in her
heart. The more she dwelled on it, the stronger her urge to
run away became. There were no physical barriers
preventing her escape, but invisible shackles held her
ankles.
Mother.
If she ran away now, her mother’s fate would be sealed.
“…Ugh.”
It was a cruel weighing of scales.
“Huff…”
To keep her promise to Theodore, she would have to
abandon her mother. Conversely, to save her mother, she
would have to betray Theodore.
Why did it have to be like this?
Why did she have to be stuck in such a dreadful situation,
caught between the two people she loved most in the
world? How did she end up at such a cliff’s edge?
How?
As Lisbell stared blankly at the ornate design on the door,
her upper body slowly leaned forward.
Her forehead touched the cold floor. A silent scream
escaped her open mouth. A single ray of sunlight fell warmly
on her outstretched foot. The uncomfortable warmth
scratched at her, reminding her of the last memory
fragment of Marnia left in the dust.
It hadn’t been long since the bell rang at noon, but the sun
had set too quickly.
No, it was that Lisbell hadn’t been able to make a decision
swiftly.
It was a painful time.
Like a praying person, she lay on the floor for a long time,
unable to move, before she slowly got up and wandered
aimlessly around the drawing room. She repeatedly grasped
the doorknob she had given up on turning, and sat idly on
the sofa, staring at her feet.
It was a battle between what she couldn’t endure now and
what she might not endure in the future.
After long contemplation, Lisbell chose the present. She
decided to save her mother, who was in immediate danger.
After all, her mother’s situation was already a reality, but
her future with Theodore hadn’t happened yet.
She just needed to secure Ulrich’s mercy. That way, she
could save her mother and end this situation here. It was
undeniable that her own sacrifice was the fastest and
easiest path.
The “act” with Ulrich tonight would be dreadful and
disgusting, but as long as she wasn’t caught, it was a risk
she could take.
If Theodore never found out…
She painfully realized that just considering such a secret
meant she was starting to deceive him, but she forced
herself to ignore it.
She couldn’t abandon her struggling mother.
In the isolated space, Lisbell reached a conclusion that
gnawed at her heart.
Of course, just deciding to do it didn’t make the situation
any easier. My fingertips trembled as I barely managed to
turn the doorknob to the reception room.
Is this the right thing?
Is this the right decision?
As I stood in front of his bedroom door, next to the study,
the mental conflict continued to gnaw at me. My lungs felt
like they had turned to stone, and my breathing was so
erratic I wasn’t sure how I was even getting air. The tension
and overwhelming resignation made my chest tighten.
Knock, knock.
I knocked as if I were knocking on the gates of hell.
I heard a response from inside, but my head was so fuzzy I
couldn’t make out the words. Assuming it was an invitation
to come in, I turned the doorknob.
Ulrich was sitting on the edge of his desk, the receiver
wedged between his ear and shoulder. While I had been
curled up on the floor, consumed by my wretched worries,
he had been calmly dealing with business.
He glanced at me with just a flick of his eyes.
“Finished worrying?”
He asked as he ended the call. It was both a question and a
prompt. He was urging me to make a decision as I stood just
outside the room. Lisbell bit her lip to keep from crying,
forcing herself to wake from her dazed state.
“Mercy…”
“Hmm?”
“Will you promise me mercy?”
“Oh.”
Ulrich, as if suddenly recalling it, put down the receiver and
straightened his back. The intense twilight slowly creeping
in behind him was a terrifyingly grand sight.
“Alright, fine. A promise.”

“Should I pinky swear?”
His casual attitude, regardless of the situation, seemed
almost deliberate. Lisbell shook her head quickly, putting
strength into her voice.
“No. A proper, a proper promise.”
Ulrich chuckled and said, “Yes, yes.”
“With evidence.”
His delayed understanding was almost infuriatingly cold. As
I stared at him with sorrowful eyes, Ulrich gestured for me to
come closer.
As I walked slowly towards him, he pulled out a document
and a fountain pen. He bit off the pen cap with his molars,
then scribbled something on the back of the document with
the sharp nib. He then handed it to the approaching Lisbell.
It was the letter of clemency she had desperately wanted,
detailing his promise to show leniency towards Mrs. Osborne
as a victim of the incident, signed in Ulrich’s own hand. 
As she reached for it, Ulrich’s hand withdrew it just a
moment before she could grasp it.
“Not yet.”

“Our deal hasn’t even started.”

“We can’t have both mother and daughter branded as
thieves, right?”
Ulrich stood up. Lisbell could only watch anxiously as the
paper was placed in the third drawer of his desk.
Returning to her, he loosened his tie, which suddenly caught
Lisbell’s attention.
In this situation, it was a realization of no help.
She hadn’t known in the reception room. It would have been
better if she had continued not knowing…
The tie he was loosening was the one Lisbell had given him.
If only she had never known…
He stood before Lisbell, casually toying with the loosely
knotted tie, looking far too refined to be proposing such a
lowly deal. Unlike her, who had been driven here with a
heart full of despair, he remained impeccably composed,
almost bringing her to tears.
Yes, even after today, he would remain unchanged. Unlike
her, who would be personally destroyed, Ulrich Altahart
would continue his life as effortlessly as ever.
Seeing her swallow her boiling tears, he smiled. His
beautiful smile only made her feel as if the ground were
sinking beneath her feet.
His appearance suggested that women might voluntarily
kneel and approach to warm his bed. Given his convenient
and efficient looks, it was unfathomable why he would
demand such unjust and despicable actions from someone
promised to another. If she could understand it, she
wouldn’t be here.
Ulrich reached out. His touch, surprisingly warm, made
Lisbell flinch.
“Why are you crying already?”

“I don’t like women who cry outside the bed.”
It was only upon hearing Ulrich’s words that Lisbell realized
she was crying. Her tears were hot, so hot it felt as though
they might melt her spirit. She almost wished they would, so
she could avoid this situation. She wished she could become
dust and disappear from the world.
Ulrich, who had been rubbing her pale, frozen cheek,
grasped her slender chin.
He lifted her face, bringing their lips close. Unlike in the
daytime reception room, he leisurely licked her wet cheek.
The unusual contact made her flinch.
“Ugh…”
Lifting her chin higher, he extended his tongue, licking away
her tear tracks. It was a meaningless gesture, as his saliva
replaced the tears. Watching him lap at her like a starving
man, it was clear there was no kindness in his actions.
His tongue wandered her cheek before finally covering her
lips.
When Lisbell instinctively tried to pull away, he wrapped an
arm around her waist, pulling her onto the bed.
Feeling like a sacrificial offering, Lisbell lifted her upper body
before he could fully pin her down. With Ulrich’s upper body
immediately over her, they maintained an awkward angle.
Ulrich attacked with an open mouth from the start. Sucking
her lower lip until it lost color, he then licked the seam of
her upper lip as if exploring its taste.
“Mm, mmph.”
Unable to breathe, her hand trembled. Ulrich pushed his
tongue deep into her mouth. Lisbell’s back arched. When
she tried to turn her head, Ulrich grabbed her nape firmly,
signaling he wouldn’t allow it.
“Ahh… mmph…!”
His fierce tongue explored every corner of her mouth, slick
saliva overflowing. Ulrich seemed determined to make her
swallow it, slipping his tongue to the edge of her throat.
Helpless, Lisbell could only gulp down his breath and saliva.
Ulrich’s tongue thoroughly coated hers, licking and sucking
it before releasing it. A silver thread extended between their
parted lips, both thoroughly soaked.
“Clumsy.”
“Ha, ahh…”
“I’ve never had such a poor kiss before.”
It was exasperating, but at least novel.
“A woman with a fiancé…”
Despite her engagement, her body reacted vulnerably to
every new $exual stimulus. It was as if she had never
experienced such touches.
It was obvious.
The man she was to marry must be just as dull and
lukewarm. They were perfectly matched.
“What’s your fiancé’s name?”

“Your fiancé’s name, Lisbell.”
Gently stroking the back of her neck, he coaxed an answer.
Lisbell kept her mouth shut. Already feeling sinful about
being in this bed, she didn’t want to bring up Theodore,
even in passing. For tonight, she wanted to bury everything
about her fiancé deep within herself.
But rebellion didn’t work with Ulrich.
“Ah!”
The once gentle hand suddenly grabbed a handful of her
hair.
“Name.”
“Ugh…”
“Do I need to ask three times?”
Impatient with her stubbornness, he pressed another kiss
onto her with a slightly irritable demeanor.
