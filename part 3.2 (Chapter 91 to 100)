Chapter 91

Could a nightmare really be this detailed?

 

Even after waking up, Lisbell couldn’t fully regain her composure due to the unsettling aftermath. In a bedroom where only the sound of rain dared to intrude, she lay frozen, curled up tightly on bedding that felt even more repulsive because of its luxury.

 

It wasn’t until the sweat that made her slip damp began to dry, and the cold set in, that she started to come to her senses. She threw off the blanket, got out of bed, and approached the window. Even though the window wasn’t open, the sound of the rain was intense. It was the kind of weather that made it seem as if invisible waves were crashing in.

 

Lisbell placed her hand on the window frame and stared blankly for a moment before heading to the bathroom. She washed away the sticky sweat on her naked body with warm water and put on fresh clothes. Just yesterday, a thin blouse was enough, but today, the unusual chill made her rub her arms. Reluctantly, she took out and wore a thick wool vest.

 

Perhaps because the nightmare that started her day was so unsettling, her mood remained sour all morning. Once again, she didn’t touch the food that was served. The image of her mother’s entrails being torn apart by a crow, whether dead or alive, still lingered, and she had no appetite.

 

The sky was overcast, and her mind was clouded.

 

It was one of those days when, even indoors, you feel utterly helpless, as if you were trapped in the torrential rain. Each time the sky couldn’t bear the onslaught of the rain and thunder cracked loudly, she felt even more disturbed. It was as if the scream of the crow from her dream was being resurrected.

 

Lisbell rubbed her still-aching chest and then began to tidy up. It was about time to go see Noah. Before leaving the bedroom, Lisbell habitually walked over to the mantelpiece.

 

Underneath the newly decorated wreath on the wall, the mantelpiece was clean as always.

 

The place where she would leave letters for her mother…

 

Though it had always been empty, today the sight of it felt particularly strange. Lisbell swept her hand over the empty shelf before turning away.

 

She exited the bedroom, rounded the corner of the hallway, and was about to descend the stairs when a steady shadow stretched to her feet. She had grown accustomed to checking her feet first and lifted her head out of habit. There stood Julian Scott. Arms crossed, he was still, as if waiting for someone. And Lisbell suspected that someone was her, as he straightened his posture when their eyes met.

 

“Lisbell.”

 

Come to think of it, wasn’t it on these stairs that they last spoke a week ago?

 

The place where he had made the brazen proposal to help her win the favor of the lady, who had been displeased with her.

 

Lisbell closed her eyes deeply and then opened them. She wished that gesture could dispel the remnants of the nightmare, but they clung to her as if glued to her eyelids, vividly.

 

“I was waiting for you.”

 

He said they should talk if there was anything he had discovered. As he had said, she had encountered him two or three times while staying at the mansion over the past week, but unlike before, they had passed each other like strangers. So today, his deliberate waiting could only mean one thing.

 

“Did you find out anything?”

 

“I did.”

 

For the first time, Lisbell took a step toward him.

 

“What is it?”

 

At her impatient question, Julian crossed his arms and leaned against the railing. With eyes that seemed to be contemplating something, he spoke.

 

“Your mother’s name, Helen Osborne, is correct, right?”

 

“Yes.”

 

“I checked, and it turns out that name is indeed on the list of patients using the special ward. Apparently, she’s staying in the best private room there. I personally confirmed this at the Royal Hospital this morning.”

 

Was it all just a baseless worry?

 

Lisbell felt a weight lift from her chest, but she couldn’t fully dismiss her suspicions because of the look on Julian’s face. He seemed unable to shake off a lingering doubt.

 

“However… I heard something strange from the nurse in charge of the ward.”

 

“Strange? What do you mean?”

 

“She said there’s always a foul smell coming from Helen Osborne’s room.”

 



 

“Like the smell of a dried-up corpse rotting away…”

 

Her heart clenched tightly.

 

It felt as if it had dropped with a heavy thud.

 

An uncontrollable tremor started to spread across her chest. Lisbell had to make a great effort not to clutch at it. As a result, she couldn’t stop her expression from crumbling.

 

A corpse?

 

The smell of a rotting corpse?

 

The smell of a dried-up corpse?

 

Lisbell faltered. Had she not instinctively strengthened her grip on the floor, she might have collapsed right there. But Julian Scott reached out a hand, as if she seemed particularly vulnerable. Normally, she would have pushed him away immediately, but she was in no state to do so now.

 

Why does the sound of the crow’s cry come to mind at this moment?

 

Why does the bloodstain on the crow’s beak come to mind now?

 

Why does the image of the dried-up body’s entrails come to mind now…?

 

She felt like she was slipping back into the nightmare, lost in a black thicket. Lisbell blinked several times.

 

“Are you okay?”

 

She only snapped out of it when the unfamiliar voice felt unusually close. Lisbell quickly pushed him away and stood up straight. Her frozen lips parted, and words poured out urgently.

 

“Are you sure about this?”

 

Julian, who had been looking down at his hand, which had been pushed away without hesitation, recovered his usual sly smile.

 

“Well, I can’t say for sure.”

 



 

“But the nurse has no reason to make up such a story.”

 

“But, but it doesn’t make any sense.”

 



 

“You said it yourself, a huge fund was invested in establishing and running that ward. To give the best special room, in such a well-maintained place, to someone who’s already dead… that’s not just wasteful, it’s absurdly extravagant, isn’t it?”

 

“Hmm, that’s true.”

 

“And then again, it’s not unusual for a hospital to smell of corpses. The city is overflowing with people, and just as many die every day. So the nurse might have been mistaken because she was busy…”

 

“Lisbell.”

 



 

“You’ve already made up your mind not to believe me.”

 

Lisbell flinched. Her reaction was that of someone sharply struck in a sensitive spot.

 

Julian, watching her closely with what could be seen as a pitiful expression, gave a slightly sympathetic smile.

 

“Do as you please. I was only passing along the news; it’s up to you whether to believe it or not.”

 



 

“But since we disagree, it’s probably best to postpone the reward. I don’t want to receive a kiss from you under these circumstances.”

 

His talk of a kiss, so out of place in this situation, read entirely differently to Lisbell. She looked up at him with eyes that seemed on the verge of tears.

 

“…So you’re convinced.”

 



 

“You believe that my mother might already be a corpse.”

 

“Ulrich Altahart, after all.”

 



 

“He’s the kind of person who could easily do something that crazy.”

 

Julian’s added comment, delivered with a shrug, was despairing. Lisbell felt like a sandcastle about to crumble under the slightest breeze, and she swallowed hard. Despite her instinct to deny it, the more her heart pounded wildly, the colder her mind became.

 

No matter how much she wanted to avoid it, Julian’s opinion seemed all too plausible. After all, as he claimed, it explained the questions that had repeatedly rendered Lisbell powerless. Why he had avoided taking her to the hospital under the pretense of being too busy…

 

“I have to check.”

 



 

“I have to check… for myself.”

 

“How?”

 

“I’ll ask.”

 

“The second young master?”

 

Julian scoffed.

 

“That’s like asking a lion if it will eat you. That man holds your weaknesses in his hands. Even if it’s true, do you think he’d answer honestly?”

 



 

“When will you finally face reality?”

 

His genuinely concerned voice seeped into every corner of her heart. Lisbell bit her lip. The wound on her mouth, which she thought had healed, throbbed as if it had reopened.

 

No, it wasn’t just her lip. Her entire body ached as if it were being chewed up and swallowed. She couldn’t stop every cell in her body from screaming as if she were facing a situation beyond her control.

 

“Thank you for finding out.”

 

“Lisbell.”

 

“You declined the kiss, so let’s consider it as never having happened. If there’s another way to repay your kindness, I’ll be sure to do so.”

 

She muttered as if talking to herself, without making eye contact with him. She worried that Julian might stop her from leaving, but fortunately, he didn’t. It seemed he had realized that she needed some time to gather her thoughts.

Ulrich never believed in such a being.

 

If there was something he did believe in, it was the sliver of morality that lay buried deep within even the most despicable of humans.

 

After all, no matter how corrupt someone may be, there is always a certain moral threshold they won’t cross.

 

Lisbell considered her mother’s issue, which she and Ulrich had been endlessly tugging over, to be the same. For him, it was a matter of life and death, and for Lisbell, it was the matter of the last remaining family she had in the world. Though they might have felt the weight differently, both recognized that it was an issue that warranted gravity.

 

Or so she thought. But was she wrong?

 

That man… did he truly lack even a shred of decency…?

 

…It’s all meaningless.

 

Lisbell sighed deeply, as if her insides were being scraped. Thinking about it alone wasn’t going to provide any answers.

 

Moreover, nothing had been proven to be true yet. Perhaps, as she had mumbled to herself, it was all just a misunderstanding.

 

What if she caused a fuss against Ulrich based solely on what Julian had said, and it turned out not to be true?

 

It was said that there was indeed a patient with that name on the hospital list, but the smell of corpses was just a rumor. There was no concrete evidence to confirm it. Lisbell tried to steady her trembling heart by thinking this way.

 

Bang.

 

Distracted by her own confusion, she forgot to knock. She realized her mistake only after she had already opened the door to Noah’s bedroom.

 

“Heuk…!”

 

Noah, who had been crouching in front of the bed, jumped up, flailing his arms in surprise. On the bed was the familiar box—the one the child had repeatedly told her not to look inside.

 

His frantic gestures suggested he had been inspecting its contents.

 

“Sorry. Did I scare you? I forgot to knock today….”

 

As Noah hurriedly tried to close the lid, he knocked the box over, and its contents spilled out onto the floor. Small, square objects scattered messily.

 

Lisbell was about to apologize, but then she stopped.

 



 

Despite being caught, the boy anxiously scrambled to gather the scattered items. But there was no way he could clean it all up quickly. His small frame was no match for the mess.

 

As a result, Lisbell clearly saw what had been inside the box. Standing there in a daze, she felt a cold sensation seeping into her veins.

 

She stood frozen for a moment before slowly taking a few steps forward. The objects that Noah hadn’t yet noticed lay forlornly on the floor. She bent down slowly to pick one up.

 

[To Mother]

 

The handwriting was familiar. The size was familiar. The color was familiar. Even the weight in her hand was familiar—it was the same letter she placed on the mantelpiece every morning as a promise.

 

The letter that should have been delivered to her mother in the hospital… why was it here?

 

“Helen Osborne’s hospital room always smells foul.”

 

“Like the rotting stench of a dried-up corpse….”

 

Her fragile belief was already cracking, and this new suspicion only made it worse. The emotions that had already started to fray at the edges became unbearably fragile, crumbling with the slightest impact. The trust she had in Ulrich, which was never based on solid evidence, shattered completely.

 

“Noah, why do you have this?”

 

By the time Lisbell realized what she was doing, she was already gripping Noah’s shoulder tightly.

 

The boy, startled by the unexpected strength she had never shown before, looked terrified.

 

“Answer me, Noah! Why is this here?”

 

Noah began to cry, his body trembling.

 

“U-u-un-uncle….”

 



 

“Uncle threw it away. Every morning, h-hic… I saw him throw it away….”

 

“…Uncle?”

 

“Yes. Huhng…”

 

Lisbell’s grip on Noah’s shoulder loosened. Her legs gave out, and she collapsed in front of the boy.

 

Her eyes, drained of all emotion, turned to the letters scattered around them. There were so many—far too many to count. She could guess how many there were just by looking at them. Perhaps they matched the number of days she had stayed in this mansion.

 

Yes, perhaps from the very beginning, the letters….

 

“Ulrich Altahart.”

 

“A man like that would do something so insane without batting an eye.”

 

Her entire body shivered.

 

These letters were evidence.

 

Evidence of Ulrich’s true nature—something she had been avoiding, pretending not to see, all along.

 

Where is my mother…?

 

Where on earth is my mother right now?

 

Could it be, possibly?

 

Finally, the most horrifying thought she had tried to bury deep within her mind surfaced. Fragments of a nightmare she had desperately tried to suppress began to emerge.

 

A crow, cawing loudly, pecked at her mother’s entrails. The resilient skin of her organs was torn apart, and the bird savored the taste of her blood.

 

Come to think of it, did that crow…

 

Have gray-blue eyes?

 

A scene from her broken dream came back to her as she awoke. Ulrich’s malicious intent, which she had finally confronted, jolted her mind awake, cracking open the memories she had locked away.

 

Lisbell remained frozen, unable to react.

 

“Huhuhng.”

 

Noah, whose shoulder she had just released, burst into tears in front of her. The boy seemed deeply hurt that Lisbell, whom he had trusted and followed, had turned on him. His cries sounded like her own—suppressed and unheard in her dream. Perhaps she had also cried with such grief and sorrow.

 

Noah cried, but Lisbell could not.

 

Unable to cry even in reality, she felt herself being driven to the brink.

 

“Noah, I’m sorry.”

 

Lisbell, who had risen to her knees, pulled Noah into a hug.

 

“I’m sorry for yelling.”

 

She apologized as she stroked the back of his head.

 

“It’s not your fault.”

 

Yes, it’s really not your fault.

 

“So don’t cry….”

 

Noah was always overly cautious. The way he had nervously looked through the letters in this room, how he had questioned her about them while in her arms—how much anxiety and fear must have grown in him, unnoticed by Lisbell.

 

But the person who should have felt those things was someone else.

 

Lisbell continued to gently pat Noah’s back. The boy, feeling that she had finally returned to the person he knew, clung to her. His sobs lingered heavily in her embrace.

 

Lisbell’s face, unseen by the boy, was emotionless, as if she had been drained of all feeling.

 

She realized something for the first time.

 

When someone becomes too angry, instead of boiling over with rage, they actually become extremely calm. Whether it’s because their emotions reach a certain limit and become numb, or because their entire nervous system is paralyzed, she didn’t know, but it was true.

 

This kind of anger.

 

This kind of betrayal.

 

Had she ever felt anything like it before?

 

It seemed like her entire being had frozen over, so much so that if she breathed, she wondered if a hollow sound would echo from within her. Lisbell curled her hand into a fist. The letter she hadn’t yet put down crumpled in her grasp.

 

It didn’t matter.

 

After all, it was a letter that would never be delivered.

 

***

 

“You’re awake?”

 

Ulrich, who had quietly entered the room, saw Lisbell sitting on the bed and asked in surprise.

 

He usually returned well past midnight, so the bedroom was often dark and quiet, with Lisbell sound asleep in the peaceful scene. His surprise was understandable.

 

The bedroom was softly lit by a single lamp. Lisbell sat quietly, watching the man move in the dim light. He smelled like the cold of winter, even after taking off his coat, which was covered in the outdoor air.

 

He began unbuttoning his shirt, seemingly intending to go wash up, but then glanced over at the bed and chuckled.

 

“Did you just wake up?”

 



 

“You look a bit out of it.”

 

He gently tapped her cheek, as if he had seen something adorable. His touch was reminiscent of someone petting a small dog, and it made her shudder. Perhaps the man really did think of her as such. After all, she had obediently believed every word he said, as naively as a fool.

 

“I’m going to the hospital tomorrow.”

 

It was a phrase she had repeated countless times in her mind while waiting for him to return. Her voice, still cold and detached, proved it had come from deep within her frozen heart.

 

The eerie tone of her voice settled on the bedroom floor like a shadow.

 

As if his feet were caught in it, Ulrich stopped in his tracks, unable to move towards the bathroom.


“Not ‘I want to go,’ but ‘I will go.'” 

 

It wasn’t a request but a command.

 

Ulrich’s eyebrows arched subtly, as if he noticed the slight shift in nuance.

 

Soon, he returned to his usual smiling expression.

 

“Tomorrow, then.”

 



 

“Tomorrow, I’ll…”

 

“Are you unavailable again?”

 

Lisbell rose from the bed, supporting herself with her palm.

 

“Then, the day after tomorrow?”

 

She walked silently.

 

“And the day after that?”

 

Lisbell reached for the box she had placed inside the small wardrobe. Hugging it, she turned around to confirm Ulrich’s expression. Though it was too dark to see clearly, she could tell that his usual calmness was gone.

 

In the darkness, the man’s eyes glinted fiercely. It was as if he was puzzled by Lisbell’s unusual persistence, picking at the nuances and dragging out the conversation.

 

That too, was a deception. How much must she have been underestimated for him not to have imagined something like this could happen?

 

Grinding her teeth, Lisbell forced a bright smile.

 

“Do you even plan on taking me to the hospital?”

 

She smiled, and Ulrich smiled too. Neither smile had any soul in it. Both were twisted, with only the sinister intention of seeing through each other’s true thoughts.

 

Ulrich glanced down at the unknown box in her arms and let out a sigh, seemingly feigned. He then approached her with a few steps and gently stroked her shoulder.

 

“I’ve been so busy lately with many things that I haven’t paid attention to that. I apologize if it upset you.”

 

If she didn’t know the truth, how would this affectionate gesture have seemed?

 

Regardless of how he behaved, she would have obediently submitted to make sure the meeting took place, even if there was no certainty of it. She would have taken the submissive role, never knowing it was a blind hope.

 

“Then take me tomorrow, right away.”

 

“Lisbell, as I said before…”

 

“I don’t mind if it’s at dawn.”

 

“We need to consider the hospital’s position as well. No matter how upset you are, throwing a tantrum like this is…”

 

“The hospital’s position?”

 

Lisbell sneered.

 

“Not yours?”

 

The smile on Ulrich’s face faded. He looked at her with a complex expression, as if he wasn’t sure whether to smile or not. Lisbell steadied her trembling voice under the pretty and sinister eyes that looked down at her arrogantly.

 

“Aren’t you just trying to stop me from going to the hospital, for your own reasons?”

 

“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

 

“You don’t know?”

 

Lisbell flipped over the box in her arms.

 

The lid fell off, and the contents spilled out all over the floor, covering the ground beneath the two of them with neatly folded letters. Ulrich’s eyes dropped downwards. His gaze stiffened as he took in the sight of the letters. His confusion was turning into bewilderment.

 

Lisbell threw the now-empty box towards the bed.

 

“Is my mother even at that hospital?”

 



 

“Answer me.”

 



 

“Is my mother even alive?!”

 

Her voice, shrill with stress, shattered the air. The harsh tone filled the spacious bedroom, as if it was a desperate cry.

 

Why did she come to live in this city where she had no connections? It was for her mother’s treatment. Even though it was just for a brief moment, the greed that had once tempted her to abandon her mother had sunk deep into her, leaving her with a profound sense of guilt. Unable to suppress that intense emotion, she ended up following him.

 

She thought that enduring the lonely and desolate life was her way of atoning for her mother. It was a grueling existence, a self-reproach for daring to forget the grace of being born and raised, and trying to live on her own.

 

But what if all that time she endured, thinking only of her mother, was actually useless?

 

Lisbell didn’t know how to cope with this emptiness. Like a wound that hurt even though she knew it would, it was something she had to pick at, until it inevitably burst out in this cruel manner.

 

“Why is this here?”

 

Ulrich, on the other hand, remained calm.

 

He kicked one of the letters on the floor with his toe, his face now devoid of any smile. His indifferent and arrogant demeanor became a damning piece of evidence. Lisbell vaguely realized with what kind of mind he took the letter from the mantelpiece every morning.

 

“…Is torturing people with false hope a hobby of yours?”

 

Ulrich quietly lifted his head.

 

By now, Lisbell’s eyes were filled with tears, and she glared at him fiercely.

 

“Why did you take the letters if you weren’t going to deliver them?”

 

“If I hadn’t.”

 

He took a step forward. The letters scattered on the floor were crushed under his shoe. Lisbell felt as if her entire body ached, as if she were one of those letters. Ulrich grasped her chin, his expression hardening.

 

“It was obvious you’d act this stubbornly.”

 



 

“Who was it?”

 

“Let go.”

 

“Who gave you these?”

 

“I said, let go…!”

 

Lisbell shook off his hand. As she pushed him away with a loud sound, Ulrich ran his hand through his hair, now looking tired. Soon, he recovered his smile, but it was crooked and radiated a dangerous aura.

 

“Ugh…!”

 

He grabbed her wrist and shoved her back. The two pairs of feet kicked and scattered the pile of letters. Lisbell’s small body collapsed onto the bed. Ulrich pinned her arms above her head and glared down at her with bloodshot eyes.

 

“I’ve asked three times now, who gave them to you?”

 

His tone was sharp and threatening. It was a sign that his nerves were truly frayed. If this were a normal situation, Lisbell might have watched her words and actions more carefully, but not now. Determined to break the tension, she shouted back with all her strength.

 

“Questions are my right. I have no obligation to answer someone who deceived me!”

 

“And who decides that?”

 

“Answer me. Is my mother alive?”

 

“Are we playing some sort of question-and-answer game?”

 

“Ulrich!”

 

Ulrich slowly released his grip on her arms. He then sighed deeply, his face full of exhaustion. His pupils moved slowly and ominously, like a predator’s. The moment Lisbell noticed this unknown sense of danger, she flinched.

 

“…Ugh!”

 

Ulrich’s hand suddenly wrapped around her throat. As his upper body leaned forward, a shadow fell over her, threateningly enveloping her small frame.

 

“Gah, ugh…!”

 

Without hesitation, he squeezed her windpipe, making it hard for her to breathe. Lisbell instinctively flailed her arms and legs, but even as he watched her struggle, he didn’t loosen his grip. Lisbell hit, scratched, and pinched his arm, but he didn’t budge.

 

As her oxygen supply dwindled, her vision blurred, doubling and tripling before merging into a grotesque blur. It felt as if someone was shaking her head violently. Lisbell found herself experiencing an overwhelming, unknown terror.

 

Her mind flickered like a dying light. It felt as though she was experiencing the final moments of her life, with her consciousness becoming muddled, her senses crushed.

 

Her half-closed lashes trembled. Just as her last bit of breath was about to stop, Ulrich finally released his grip, veins bulging in his hand.

 

“Haah…!”

 

“I told you not to make me repeat myself.”

 

“Huff, huff…”

 

“Your learning curve seems to drop at the most inconvenient times.”

 

Without blinking, Ulrich had choked her, and now he shook his head in disapproval.

 

Meanwhile, Lisbell, who was curled up beneath him, gasped for breath, clutching her neck.

 

He was serious.

 

He seriously tried to choke me just now.

 

I could have died, and knowing that…

 

Her mind, filled with panic like a lightning strike, froze in shock and couldn’t function properly. Her thoughts were fragmented, unable to connect. It was a reaction akin to someone overwhelmed by a fear they couldn’t comprehend.

 

Then suddenly, she started to cry.

 

Her breath, which had been labored, quickly became wet with tears. Lisbell buried her face in the sheets and exhaled shallow breaths.

 

She had never felt so miserable. Why had it become so difficult just to learn about her mother’s safety and well-being?

 

She had thought countless times that it was meaningless to try to figure out where everything had gone wrong. But still, she found herself habitually retracing her steps to the beginning.

 

But now, she couldn’t even determine that starting point anymore.

 

She didn’t know.

 

No matter how many times she tried to reason why she had to suffer like this, she couldn’t understand.


“Please… tell me the truth.”

 

Even in this situation, the fact that there was still a duty she couldn’t abandon made her despair deeply. Lisbell, finally succumbing to the overwhelming situation, spoke in a voice that was utterly subdued.

 

“I know everything now. It’s true that Mother is admitted to that hospital, but I’ve heard suspicious circumstances that question whether she’s still alive.”

 



 

“I’ve heard that there’s a rotten corpse smell, that such a strange smell is coming from Mother’s hospital room. I….”

 

“From whom?”

 



 

“Who told you that?”

 

Lisbell’s lips, which had been trembling pitifully, suddenly stilled. Ulrich noticed that she was trying to protect her informant even in this situation and gave a faint, mocking smile.

 

“You’re going to stay silent?”

 



 

“Do you think I won’t find out?”

 

The brutal weight that had been crushing her body disappeared. Lisbell, who had been crying silently, wiped away her tears and looked up, startled. Ulrich, who had slightly raised his upper body, shifted his gaze sideways. The way his eyes moved, as if in deep thought, was eerie. After a moment, he slowly ran a hand through his hair.

 

“There’s only one person in this mansion who would tell you such things.”

 

His gesture was calm and leisurely, but an indescribable aura emanated from it.

 

“That whore.”

 

It was something akin to malevolent madness.

 

He got out of bed completely. Without hesitation, Ulrich turned and left the bedroom.

 

Left alone in the dark room, Lisbell stood in a daze before hurriedly scrambling off the bed. She left the bedroom barefoot, without even properly putting on her shoes.

 

As she tried to guess where Ulrich, who had suddenly revealed a murderous intent, had gone, she sensed movement from the other side. She ran toward the light at the end of the corridor.

 

She arrived at a place she had never been before. The large double doors, as big as those of Ulrich’s bedroom, were flung open in a hurry. From inside, a sharp scream, almost pitiful, erupted. As Lisbell’s toes curled inward, the doorframe banged loudly, swinging open on both sides.

 

“What the…!”

 

Ulrich came out from inside. He wasn’t alone. A naked man, not even a thread of clothing on him, was hanging from his arm. The identity of the man became clear only after he was thrown pitifully against the wall with a thud.

 

“Why… suddenly… ugh!”

 

Ulrich’s black shoe stomped on the nape of Julian’s neck, who had been dragged out of the bedroom. Julian, who had been leaning against the wall, flailed for a moment before sliding down to lie sprawled on the carpet. As he twisted his body, his erect cock swayed back and forth. His flesh was drenched with pre-ejaculate, as if he had just finished having fun.

 

He should have quickly gotten up and hidden his shameful appearance, but Julian couldn’t do that. Ulrich, with an expression frighteningly devoid of emotion, ruthlessly kicked him. The rain of kicks landed indiscriminately on his face and naked body.

 

It was already deep into the night, past midnight. At a time when even the smallest noise could sound like thunder, movement could be sensed from afar.

 

“Ugh…!”

 

At that moment, Julian curled up, clutching his chest. Ulrich’s shoe had struck him in the solar plexus. Ulrich didn’t stop there and swung his foot, smashing it into Julian’s chin. Whether it was a nosebleed or blood from his mouth, it wasn’t clear where it came from, but a red stain splattered across the wall. Lisbell, who had been standing there, unable to breathe, covered her mouth at the brutal scene.

 

The next moment, someone appeared, holding onto the doorframe Ulrich had come through. Cora Altahart, Ulrich’s mother, emerged, her hair disheveled and barely covered by a nightgown. She stood at the door, speechless as she watched her son brutally beat his lover.

 

She only came to her senses when Ulrich, standing over the bloodied Julian, turned his head. The pale moonlight touched one side of his face. The coldness of his profile was so chilling that it seemed insufficient to describe it as unfeeling. It was as if he lacked the basic moral decency that a human should possess.

 

Ulrich took a long stride to the other side of the corridor. He stood before a decorative table. A tall vase with eucalyptus was placed on it. He picked up the vase and turned it over. The green eucalyptus stems and the water inside spilled out.

 

“Ulrich!”

 

His mother was the first to realize what he intended to do, and she let out a shriek of warning, but there wasn’t even a hint of change in Ulrich’s pupils. He walked determinedly toward Julian and struck him over the head with the vase.

 

Crash!

 

The shattering sound echoed as if it would break the very air, and a dreadful silence descended upon the corridor. Julian, who had been trembling with the last remnants of consciousness, soon slumped like a corpse. Blood flowed from his head like a river. What had been a river turned into a lake, and what had been a lake turned into a sea, filling the entire area with the stench of blood.

 

Ah….

 

Lisbell stepped back. The hand covering her mouth trembled uncontrollably.

 

Is he… dead?

 

Is he really dead?

 

It couldn’t be. Can a person die so easily? Couldn’t he just be unconscious? But with that much blood pouring out, could it really be just unconsciousness? Lisbell couldn’t shake the first encounter with such violence from her mind.

 

What made her shiver even more at this moment was Ulrich, standing before the crushed Julian.

 

Despite having utterly destroyed a person, he remained eerily calm. Aside from his disheveled hair, there was nothing in his appearance that suggested he had just been in a violent struggle. His pupils showed no sign of disturbance. With the same natural demeanor, Ulrich casually ran a hand through his hair. Only then did Lisbell feel a strange sense of déjà vu from his gaze.

 

The eyes of the crow that pecked at her mother’s entrails.

 

Lisbell could no longer distinguish if it was a crow or him.

 

“That’s why I…”

 

Ulrich let out a sigh, as if truly exhausted.

 

“…warned you to choose your friends wisely.”

 

His words were strange.

 

It was Ulrich himself who had committed the violence. The reason Julian Scott was lying there in such a state was entirely due to him. But hearing those words made it seem as if… as if he was blaming her for the violence.

 

As if Julian suffered all that solely because of her.

 

Lisbell held her breath.

 

“Rotten corpse smell, I’ve heard everything about that strange smell coming from Mother’s hospital room. I….”

 

“From whom?”

 



 

“Who told you that?”

 

No.

 

I didn’t tell him who it was.

 

“There’s only one person in this mansion who would tell you such things.”

 



 

“That whore.”

 

Even if he deduced it somehow, I never said it was Julian….

 



 

Is that really what you think?

 

“That man has a hold on you. Even if it’s true, do you think he would answer honestly?”

 

“When will you start seeing reality?”

 

From the moment I brought up the subject, didn’t I already give him enough clues to guess? But, but does that justify him assaulting Julian Scott? Does that mean I’m partly responsible?

 

So, did I cause this person’s death…?

 

Did I kill someone?

 

The conclusion she reached after layer upon layer of thoughts horrified Lisbell to her core. She wrapped her arms around herself. If she didn’t, she would be suffocated by the panic rushing over her.

 

The reason she couldn’t outright deny it was because she had done it before. Lisbell had already tried to kill someone for her own selfishness.

 

The sickly blue guilt that had been etched into her bones like a bruise.

 

The wicked nature that had tried to kill her mother to survive….

 

“Make sure this never happens in front of me again.”

 

Ulrich, adjusting his disheveled shirt sleeves, gave instructions to the elderly butler who had approached. Then he walked toward Lisbell, who was standing frozen as if nailed to the spot.

 

The shadow that stretched toward her carried a scent.

 

A murderous, bloody scent that pierced deep into her lungs….


Lisbell looked at Ulrich with trembling eyes as he grabbed her arm. He turned away as if the reason he left the bedroom was insignificant.

 

The tip of his shoe was stained with blood after mercilessly beating Julian. It was impossible to tell whether the blood was from Julian’s nose or mouth. Although the carpet was clearly black, it seemed as though red footprints followed his steps.

 

“…Call the doctor…!”

 

As Lisbell was being dragged along, she looked back. Mrs. Altahart, who was as frozen as she was by her son’s atrocity, approached the fallen Julian. Seeing her lose her usual composed demeanor made Lisbell’s heart sink.

 

“Let go, let me go….”

 



 

“Let go…! Let me go!”

 

A sense of urgency overwhelmed her; she couldn’t allow herself to be dragged away. She had no idea what he might do to her in the bedroom after just beating someone.

 

No, the very thought of being in the same space as him was repulsive.

 

The dignified and calm demeanor he once had seemed to belong to someone else entirely. The current Ulrich Altahart felt like a ravenous beast tearing into another’s entrails.

 

“Let go, let go of me. Let go….”

 

As she twisted her body desperately to free her arm, a figure briefly passed by her blurred vision. Lisbell instinctively silenced herself. The gaze of that timid child….

 

Noah had stepped out of his room, possibly due to the commotion in the hallway. Could he have failed to realize the situation and left the room alone? Unfortunately, he was hiding behind a pillar, alone in this tense atmosphere. When their eyes met, his shoulders rose sharply, like a small mountain.

 

“…Huh!”

 

Suddenly, her vision flipped.

 

Annoyed by the delay in returning to the bedroom due to her resistance, Ulrich simply slung her over his shoulder like a sack.

 

From her stiffened gaze, she caught a glimpse of the child’s face, now upside down. Noah looked on the verge of tears. At that moment, she recalled the pile of letters scattered on the bedroom floor.

 

No. 

 

She instinctively knew.

 

She must never let Ulrich discover Noah’s existence.

 

Especially not after witnessing Ulrich’s brutal punishment firsthand. The thought that Julian Scott’s fate could befall a small child made nausea crawl up her throat.

 

Lisbell quickly shook her head toward the child.

 

Don’t come.

 

Go back.

 

Make no sound and quietly return to the bedroom….

 

Whether he understood her stern warning, Noah tearfully hid behind the pillar. Meanwhile, Ulrich turned the corner of the hallway. Thanks to that, Noah remained unnoticed.

 

But the situation was far from over.

 

“Ah…!”

 

Lisbell was thrown onto the cozy bed. Having been bent over, with her organs compressed, she struggled to breathe. Clutching her chest and gasping for air, she felt a dangerous sensation shooting through her brain, and she quickly backed away toward the head of the bed.

 

Standing in front of the bed, Ulrich checked his shirt sleeve and clicked his tongue when he noticed the bloodstain he had overlooked. Soon after, he sighed lowly, as if he found the whole situation tiresome.

 

“I asked you to be honest.”

 

His tone was somewhat indifferent, as if he had grown weary of pretending. Hearing this, Lisbell felt her heartbeat accelerate like never before.

 

“Your mother.”

 

Thump, thump.

 

“She’s already.”

 

Thump, thump, thump.

 

“Been dead for a long time.”

 

Finally, thump.

 

The most wretched part of her broke into pieces. The tension that had risen to her scalp drained away, leaving only a void in its place.

 

Empty, empty.

 

The sensation of emptiness was chilling to the bone.

 

It was ironic. She was clearly hollow. Yet Lisbell felt as if she was wearing away, like a piece of thin paper, so fragile that she couldn’t withstand even a light breeze, a handful of sand, or a fine needle.

 

This despair was so tragic.

 

“…Why?”

 

Her voice, dry as dust, fell into the moonlit bedroom.

 

“Why?”

 



 

“Why… is she dead?”

 

Lisbell forgot to keep her distance and crawled forward, stuttering. Ulrich remained standing in front of the bed, motionless, so the closing gap was solely due to Lisbell’s actions. Despite her intense aversion to the man, she couldn’t resist asking him now.

 

“You promised to save her….”

 



 

“You said you’d treat her, take care of her.”

 



 

“That’s why I came to the capital…!”

 

At last, she grabbed his clothes and clung to him with all her strength.

 

“To save my mother… I threw away my dreams, my future, and endured everything you did to me!”

 

“Mrs. Osborne died before arriving in the capital.”

 



 

“To be precise, she passed away during the journey.”

 



 

“If there had been anything I could do, I would have tried. But it was impossible, so she died.”

 

His calm tone, as if stating a fact beyond human control, made her want to cry.

 

Her shattered insides couldn’t take it anymore. Tears welled up in her eyes and streamed down her cheeks. Ulrich, who had been motionless, reached out and wiped away the traces of her tears. His gentle touch carried an unknown stench, making Lisbell realize her senses weren’t working properly.

 

“Then… you should have told me.”

 



 

“You should have told me sooner….”

 

That she had already stopped breathing before arriving in the capital.

 

If that were the case, why had I endured this excruciating time here? What was I holding onto as a light to guide me through this ordeal? If it was all leading to such a futile end, then I….

 

It wasn’t just this time that felt futile.

 

Had Ulrich confessed the truth even a little earlier, she might have been able to say her last goodbyes to her mother. At the moment her mother took her last breath, her only family, her daughter, was not by her side. Because this man hid it, because this man concealed it.

 

Because of this man.

 

In the midst of the emptiness that raged within her, something began to rise. It was too hot to be called mere anger and too solid to be mere despair.

 

Something akin to a dark blue hatred.

 

“How… could you?”

 



 

“How could you…?”

 

Lisbell clenched her fists so tightly that her knuckles turned white.

 

“My mother is dead. My mother!”

 

The rough grip on his clothing left harsh wrinkles. Ulrich glanced at them. His cold expression felt as if it were shattering the ground beneath her feet.

 

“The one who gave birth to me and raised me is dead….”

 



 

“How could you think of hiding that from me…?”

 

Gritting her teeth, she finally let out a cry.

 

“Do you… have no sense of humanity at all?”

 

Her mother always said that the end was what mattered most.

 

No matter how the beginning was, no matter how the middle went, as long as the conclusion was good, one could consider the task fairly accomplished. That was why she emphasized the importance of perseverance, even if the start and middle were a mess.

 

But Lisbell had failed her mother. No matter how much love and affection she had for her mother throughout her life, what did it matter? In the end, she became the most unfilial daughter who couldn’t even see her mother off on her final journey.

 

Some things in life can be undone, but some things cannot. Someone’s death, and especially her mother’s death, was one of those irreversible things. Because of this man, Lisbell had committed an irreversible mistake.

 

“I’m sorry, but…”

 

She let go of the fabric she had been clutching. Ulrich, who had been watching her every move with calm eyes, brushed her hand away with a loud smack.

 

“I didn’t shed a single tear when Gwen died.”

 



 

“And I probably won’t at my mother’s funeral either.”

 

Unlike Lisbell, who was overwhelmed with emotions, he remained consistently calm. His composure was so unsettling that it sent chills down her spine. It felt to Lisbell as if he couldn’t understand why she was causing such a fuss over something so trivial.

 

“How could I help being born this way?”

 

He muttered nonchalantly, his expression unchanging, as if to drive the point home.


She had often felt an inexplicable sense of discomfort and incongruity around him—something beyond the oppressive atmosphere he always exuded. It was as if, despite being the same person, there was an unfathomable aspect of him that felt like encountering a bizarre creature.

 

There was something subtly off about him, as if he lacked something that should have been inherent in every ordinary person. Although his perfect background masked this flaw, once discovered, it became a fatal imperfection—his inhumanity.

 

Lisbell especially sensed this in her interactions with her mother.

 

And now, too.

 

This man… What is he?

 

The overwhelming thought of not wanting to get involved with him surged. It was the fear that if she got entangled with him any further, it would be her, not him, who would be broken.

 

“Why didn’t you tell me?”

 

Ulrich grasped her chin, lifting her face to meet his gaze more directly.

 

“Because if I had told you, I wouldn’t have been able to bring you to the capital.”

 



 

“I’m still not tired of you.”

 

Was it some sweltering summer?

 

Back then, she thought that his interest would inevitably fade with time. But during that period, the hope she had clung to slipped away with the passing of two seasons. The engagement with Theodore ended with the summer, and without her even realizing, her mother’s death came and went with the fall.

 

Now it was winter.

 

Despite the bitter cold wind blowing and the snow covering the world in a pure, brilliant blanket, his interest in her remained.

 

By now, her sense of foreboding had found solid ground to stand on.

 

Would the day ever come when his interest in me fades?

 

“…That doesn’t mean anything to me anymore.”

 



 

“My mother is gone, so I have no reason to stay here any longer.”

 

His dominance was only valid when her mother’s life was at stake. Now that this was no longer the case, there was no reason to go along with his whims. His stubbornness no longer had any power over her. Whether he was tired of her or not was no longer her concern.

 

Lisbell climbed out of bed. Opening the wardrobe, she felt a wave of emptiness. Upon reflection, she realized that all her original clothes had been disposed of by Ulrich. The only clothes left were those he had chosen for her. If it weren’t for the winter, she would have ripped them all apart and left the mansion in just one outfit. She decided to take only the clothes she was currently wearing and closed the wardrobe door.

 

Clutching the doorknob tightly, she tried to hold back the crumbling emotions inside her.

 

“Please, at least give me my mother’s body.”

 



 

“That’s enough, isn’t it? Keeping it won’t be of any value to you… Just let me have it.”

 

He grabbed her shoulders and turned her around. Ulrich was standing right in front of her, so close she hadn’t even noticed him approach. His eyes, partially lit by the moonlight streaming in, gleamed with a chilling clarity.

 

“Ugh…!”

 

Suddenly, he shoved two fingers into her mouth. What…! Startled, her mouth opened wide, unable to close. His fingers, which had dug in as if to stake a claim, briefly touched the back of her throat before withdrawing. In that moment, Lisbell involuntarily swallowed whatever substance he had placed in her mouth.

 

“What, what did…?”

 

Ulrich slowly licked his saliva-covered fingers. There was not a trace of the usual smile he often wore. A pinprick of light in his dark pupils shimmered with a rough, crazed intensity. A strange tension rippled through the air around him like waves.

 

“What did you make me swallow?”

 

“I tried to be as gentlemanly as possible.”

 

“Ulrich…!”

 

“But you rejected that.”

 

Lisbell clutched her throat, coughing. She tried to vomit it out, but it was too deep to expel. Despite knowing it was futile, she clawed at her throat, feeling as if a toxic substance was lodged in her esophagus. Swallowing it could threaten her life.

 

So, she couldn’t stay still. Red scratches appeared on her tender skin, and blood soon beaded at the surface. Seeing this, Ulrich frowned and grabbed both of her hands tightly.

 

“Ah…!”

 

She was shoved against the wardrobe, her body slumping sideways. Now sprawled on the floor, Lisbell couldn’t push Ulrich away as he came in for a kiss.

 

Suddenly, her movements felt sluggish. She thought she was responding at the right speed, but she was actually much slower as she reached for Ulrich’s shoulders.

 

“Shh…. The more you struggle, the faster the drug will take effect.”

 

“What…”

 

“It’s just a sedative, so don’t be scared.”

 

Lisbell blinked, her eyelids growing heavier with each attempt. Her whole body felt as if it were sinking into warm water, an unnatural sense of euphoria washing over her.

 

“I was afraid that if I dealt with you while you were fully conscious, I might kill you in a fit of rage.”

 

“Th-ugh…!”

 

“Lisbell, you can be quite exasperating at times, you know.”

 

His voice stretched out like a drop of water hanging from the edge of a roof. Lisbell realized that every nerve in her body was slowly descending into a deep lethargy.

 

What is this…

 

A sedative?

 

She recalled a night when he sat in the pavilion, pressing down on some pills next to his wine glass. The thought was abruptly cut off, her mind forcibly shut down.

 

Some overwhelming force, akin to a strong wave of sleep, swept her away.

 

Lisbell drifted off to sleep.

 

And when she woke again, a shackle, precisely fitted to her neck, was locked around her throat, leaving no room for even a finger to slip through.

 

***

 

“……!”

 

A silent scream escaped Lisbell’s open mouth.

 

A wave of sensation, dense and overwhelming, coursed through her from head to toe.

 

Her legs, spread over the man beneath her, stiffened, and her unsteady hips buckled as tension coiled in her lower abdomen. The heat that had pooled beneath her navel exploded in all directions, like a powerful current, enveloping her in a wild, all-consuming ecstasy.

 

The intense climax struck her with a shivering, dizzying force.

 

“Ugh, uh…”

 

Painful breaths passed through her constricted throat, and the moans that slipped out were ragged and strained. Even if she had tried to form words, all that would come out were harsh, grating sounds. Her voice, hoarse from days of overuse, was reduced to a strained whisper.

 

“Haa, haa…!”

 

It lasted only a moment before she felt as though a hole had been drilled into the top of her head, releasing steam, causing her frail body to collapse sideways. As soon as her knees hit the soft bed, she began crawling away.

 

Run, I have to run.

 

Now that his hands were off her, this was her chance. As the dissipating pleasure left her with only a shattered sense of urgency, she knew this was the only moment she had.

 

As she dragged her bruised knees across the sheets, a clicking sound followed each movement. With trembling hands, she touched her neck. The coldness of the air transferred to the shackle tightly encircling her throat.

 

Lisbell felt the helpless itch inside the shackle and dug her nails into her skin. But the shackle, designed to be unbreakable by force alone, was impossible to remove. Instead of leaving scratches, the psychological pressure of the shackle tightened around her, pushing her to the edge. She desperately wanted to escape the suffocating sensation.

 

“Ugh…!”

 

Just as she reached the edge of the bed, a hand shot out of the darkness and grabbed her ankle. Already weakened, her body collapsed like a water-soaked clump of salt, and she was dragged back.

 

“Where do you think you’re going… Come back here.”

 

His voice, as rough and ragged as her own throat, carried an inescapable undertone of lust. Ulrich, staring into Lisbell’s trembling, fear-filled eyes, pulled her back onto his body. All her efforts to escape had been in vain. Despair washed over Lisbell as she began to struggle again.

 

“No… No. Don’t… Don’t do this…! Ugh…!”

 

Resistance was futile. His hands spread her buttocks apart, and his aroused cock, slick with her fluids, began to slide against the tender flesh below. Lisbell, now pale with fear, shook her head wildly. But before she could attempt another escape, the head of his penis pressed gently into her softened folds and began to push inside.


“Ah…!”

 

A sharp, tingling sensation spread across her abdomen, but it was short-lived. The intense pleasure, which had been building up moments before, quickly surged to a level that couldn’t be ignored.

 

It wasn’t like she was under the influence of any drug, but her body had become incredibly sensitive to sexual exposure. It wasn’t without reason. This scene had become a daily routine for the past few days.

 

The place he frequented seemed worn out. It was beyond her limit. Unlike before, when he granted her some freedom during the day, Ulrich no longer left the bedroom unless absolutely necessary. And during that time, he held Lisbell close, intertwining their bodies without restraint.

 

“Ah… look at how loose it is.”

 

“Huh, uh, mm…! Ah…!”

 

“Lisbell’s hole is so slippery now. I could go all the way in.”

 

Grabbing her buttocks greedily, he pushed in as if challenging himself, all the way to the thick base. The sensation of her inner walls being scraped was unbearably creepy. Not because she disliked it, but because it felt so good that Lisbell’s pupils flickered, losing focus.

 

“Ah, ah, mm… huh!”

 

“Come here, I’ll suck on your nipples.”

 

“No, I don’t want… Ah, mm…!”

 

“Do you think anything will change just because you say no?”

 

As if still ignorant, he hid a sly smile and pushed his lower body against her more firmly, making Lisbell lean on top of him. With the large cock sliding deep between her buttocks, Lisbell’s upper body eventually collapsed forward, unable to resist.

 

Ulrich’s lips covered her small breasts, suckling on the nipples that sat like seeds on top of the mounds. As his soft tongue brushed against the already stiffly swollen protrusions, they radiated a tingling heat. The sensitive nipples, sitting atop the plain flesh, remained erect, even without being touched, due to the days of intense sex.

 

“Inside is all so soft, ha, so tender. Even if I thrust into a piece of fruit, it wouldn’t be this soft.”

 

“Huh, uh! Mm! Ah…!”

 

“Finally, the color of the hole has changed a bit. It seems all the effort I put into you is paying off, huh?”

 

As if to show her exactly where he meant, he traced his fingers over the obscene connection between them. As his fingers brushed against the flesh that was stretched wide to accommodate the straight, long rod of flesh, her walls quivered. A stinging pain followed the path he traced. The flesh was swollen and sore from taking in his cock every day without rest.

 

Each time Ulrich leisurely parted her insides, he noticed a dampness flowing along the areas he touched. After rubbing the spread labia with his fingers, he shifted direction and slowly pushed them into her hole.

 

Lisbell’s face quickly turned pale as she shook her head in urgent refusal like never before.

 

“No, I can’t… Ah…!”

 

“I think you can.”

 

He was now inserting his fingers into the already full space where his penis was lodged. She was overfilled. There wasn’t a single area that wasn’t being pressed down due to the fullness. Just the sensation of various internal pressure points being prodded caused the space below her navel to tense up, and the area connected to him pulsed with a throbbing beat. The dizzying sensation of vertigo was just an added bonus. The pleasure that would be added from here was something she could never handle. Excessive pleasure was no different from a deadly poison.

 

“No, no, ah…! Please… huh…!”

 

Tears welled up in fear that she might tear down there. Ulrich, who had only inserted the first knuckle, felt his own cock trapped in the narrow inner walls as he calmly lifted his gaze.

 

Her eyes, like the sweet flesh of a peach when squeezed, and her cheeks, the bridge of her nose, and her lips were all flushed. Ulrich stuck out his tongue and licked the tears streaming down her well-ripened cheeks.

 

“Why are you crying?”

 

“Huh, sob….”

 

“Even when you cry, you’re cute, Lisbell.”

 

Although she was reacting as if facing a life-threatening crisis, he responded as though he was watching a child easily brought to tears by a trivial prank. Unable to continue toying with her panicked reaction, Ulrich reluctantly withdrew his finger.

 

“Here.”

 

“Ha…!”

 

The Ulrich below her suddenly began thrusting his hips upward. His well-toned waist, firm with muscle, moved up and down as the thick cock sank into her hole and then pulled out. Due to the abundance of moisture, their bodies meshed together smoothly without any resistance. The thick rod, engorged with blood, forced open the tight gap, plunging deep inside and then slipping out along with the fluids.

 

“Sometimes… there are men who put their fists in, ha, just so you know.”

 

“Mm, ugh, ha…!”

 

“That kind of thing exists, so what’s the big deal about one finger?”

 

It was unbelievable. That such strange and grotesque acts existed in this world. Judging by the lack of jest in Ulrich’s expression, he wasn’t just talking nonsense. He seemed genuinely disappointed that he couldn’t properly insert his finger as he forcefully thrust his hips.

 

“Ah, mm, ah…!”

 

Lisbell, who was bouncing atop him with each vigorous thrust, couldn’t hold back. Every time, the shackle around her neck rattled along with the chain connected to the bedpost, announcing its ominous presence.

 

Each time that sound reached her ears, Lisbell felt like her insides were being corroded.

 

What is this….

 

Why am I here doing this….

 

What am I doing right now?

 

The helplessness that had once struck her down, ruthlessly tearing apart her mind and body in Marnia, had not weakened just because she was in a holy place.

 

Rather, even with the hostage of her mother gone, Lisbell’s current life, in which she couldn’t escape Ulrich’s grasp and had to share her body with him, was gnawing away at her more viciously than ever.

 

With each thrust, as she became aware of her own breathless, helpless state, it felt like her brain was decaying from the inside out.

 

People are supposed to live by their own will, so what about me right now?

 

Trapped here, unable to cling to anything, what exactly am I doing…? The confusion, like rotting roots, boldly invaded the cracks of her mind.

 

The once vibrant purple hue of her eyes was darkened by the self-loathing that consumed her.

 

Ulrich, observing this up close, overlapped his lips with hers, biting down. As soon as he forced his tongue into her mouth, initiating a deep kiss, Lisbell’s tongue curled back into a corner. Snatching it up and sucking on it vigorously, he swallowed the sobs that poured into his mouth.

 

Delighting in the piece of wretchedness he had consumed, Ulrich spread her buttocks more forcefully with both hands, holding them in a stubborn grip as he continued to thrust deeply, relentlessly driving into the hidden recesses.

 

“Ha…!”

 

It was as if he had reached an impossible place, and her vision blurred and collapsed. The feeling of being completely filled inside, combined with another minor orgasm, caused Lisbell’s upper body to collapse.

 

Ulrich caught her with his chest, continuing to pound his still unsatisfied cock inside her.

 

The faint moans that escaped Lisbell’s mouth as her body, already weakened by a mild orgasm, rippled and tightened around him, served to spur him on. With a breathy, languid sigh of satisfaction, he quickened his pace, thrusting up into her. Lisbell’s limp body shook, her faint groans escaping her mouth.

 

“Show me how your nipples jiggle.”

 

Playing with her fine, wispy hair, Ulrich forced the limp Lisbell to sit up. His hand, which had been caressing her flat lower abdomen, moved upwards, grasping her small breasts.

 

As Lisbell’s thighs clenched tightly, a dampness spread across their entwined lower bodies. With a teasing laugh, he thrust his hips upward again, mockingly asking if she had come again.

 

“Ah…!”

 

“Ha… Stay like that. Let me watch while I fuck you.”

 

“Mm, uh, ha…!”

 

“Maybe it’s because your breasts are small, but your nipples are especially cute..”

 

As he sat languidly against the headboard, vigorously thrusting his hips, the sound of flesh slapping together rang out obscenely. Unable to withstand the force of the deep plunges from below, Lisbell’s body swayed back and forth. Each time, her small, protruding nipples quivered as if begging for attention. Ulrich’s heated gaze bore down on those tiny nubs as if ravishing them.

 

“Hut… ha!”

 

All of a sudden, Lisbell squeezed her insides tight around his cock. The unprecedented tightness made Ulrich furrow his brows pleasantly as a lewd groan escaped his lips.


The issue was that the chain connected to the shackle around her neck swayed in rhythm with her suggestive movements and ended up brushing against her n!pple. A strange glint appeared in Ulrich’s eyes—one of malicious mischief.

 

“Does this feel that good?”

 

“Mm, ah, no, I don’t…!”

 

Ulrich grabbed the dangling chain and swung it side to side, making it brush against her n!pple. Even though they were indoors, the inherently cold metal chain lasciviously scraped against her swollen protrusion. The chain, cold by nature, was too much for her feverish body, already flushed from the heat of intercourse, causing her lower abdomen to clench involuntarily. Ulrich smirked, a sharp contrast cutting through the tension between their bodies.

 

“Ah, tighten up.”

 

“Nngh, ah, aah!”

 

“At this rate, my cock might give out first, Lisbell… Haa…”

 

Though it sounded like a complaint, the reality was different. As her insides, which had slackened, began to tighten again, the force with which they sucked on his now fully erect cock increased. The suction was so intense that it felt satisfying enough to bring him to climax in an instant.

 

Ulrich thrust his hips forcefully, slightly raising his upper body as he prepared to bite down on her tangled, chained breasts.

 

Knock, knock.

 

A knock interrupted their midday sex. Ulrich, who had raised his once gentle, now sharp gaze, turned his head toward the door.

 

Though no permission had been granted, the door opened. Seeing this, he immediately recognized who would be visiting him at this time of day.

 

Behind the butler, who first appeared and bowed, as expected, stood his mother. Despite being inside the mansion, his mother was elegantly dressed as always, her heels clicking on the floor as she entered the bedroom, filled with the lingering heat of their affair.

 

Mrs. Altahart did not so much as frown at the sight of her son and the naked woman pleasuring him.

 

This wasn’t the first time they had seen such scandalous aspects of each other. Even when Ulrich had suddenly barged into the bedroom well past midnight, she had been rolling naked on the bed with her lover, Julian.

 

“What brings you here?”

 

Ulrich asked indifferently, licking Lisbell’s breasts, which had ripened to the point of being suckable.

 

Lisbell, who had been too distracted by the continuous stimulation of her sensitive areas to notice the presence of another, turned her head at his sudden question. Upon seeing the unexpected intruder, she recoiled in shock.

 

She hurriedly tried to hide her flushed face, trembling all over as her freshly marked body shivered. Ulrich held her close, reclining back lazily against the headboard.

 

“Are you asking because you don’t know? I sent people to call you for days, yet you didn’t show your face, so I came myself.”

 

“For that reason, you’ve left your bedroom at this hour, with the sun high in the sky. I must have accomplished something difficult then.”

 

He pulled the blanket that had fallen to one side and covered Lisbell’s trembling body with it. As he did so, he subtly bumped their lower bodies together. Under the blanket, he could feel her squirming as if in disgust, which only made Ulrich smile with pleasure.

 

Mrs. Altahart’s narrowed blue-gray eyes took in every detail of the scene. She remained silent for a moment, as if holding back a sigh, then spoke with a faint exhale.

 

“How long do you intend to carry on like this?”

 



 

“Postponing official duties, shutting yourself in, and playing with a mistress… This behavior is unbecoming of you, Ulrich. I don’t understand why you, of all people, are doing something that would suffice for Gwen alone. This lack of discipline doesn’t suit you.”

 

“I don’t see what the problem is.”

 

“What?”

 

“The succession process that I was supposed to inherit from Gwen is almost complete. I’ve been following a grueling schedule, leaving at dawn and returning after midnight for days. Now, only tasks remain that I can handle without leaving the mansion.”

 

“You…”

 

“In some ways, it’s fortunate that your lover caused a timely incident.”

 



 

“Though I can’t forgive him for trying to ruin my plans.”

 

Ulrich casually stroked Lisbell’s hair as she nuzzled against his chin, then kissed the side of her head.

 

The small squeaks from her concealed under the blanket were so adorable that Ulrich felt his lower body tighten once more as he subtly rocked his hips. The faint, weak moans that escaped her were sweet music to his ears.

 

“If it bothers you so much, you could think of it as me taking a few days off. You know better than anyone how I’ve been on a nonstop march since arriving in the capital.”

 

It was becoming too much. His lower body was itching with unbearable need. The crude, simmering lust gnawed at his entire body. He had thought he could endure it, but now he realized how weak he was against his own desires.

 

He removed the blanket that barely covered their connected lower halves and made Lisbell sit up again. Her eyes filled with tears at the thought of being exposed so shamelessly before someone else, her naked body engaged in lewd union with a man.

 

Ulrich firmly grasped her and slowly slid his swollen penis back inside her. No matter how much Lisbell resisted, her now thoroughly soaked walls easily swallowed his cock. With a blunt exhale, her eyes lost focus.

 

“No, ah, aah! No…! Ah!”

 

“She says she doesn’t want it.”

 

Mrs. Altahart, who had been watching their intense coupling from the doorway, retorted sharply with a face that suggested things were not going as she wished.

 

Ulrich chuckled lazily, bringing his knees up as he slightly adjusted his posture. Lisbell, who had been perched atop him, was helplessly lifted along with him.

 

“She’s just throwing a tantrum.”

 

“Ahh, ah, ah…!”

 

“Do you see? She’s completely soaked down there.”

 

The heated coupling was fully exposed to his mother’s view. As if inviting her to take a closer look, Ulrich grabbed Lisbell’s hips and plunged into her soft flesh.

 

With the sudden increase in intensity, droplets of liquid burst from the gap between their bodies. The thick, sticky fluid dripped down her thighs, soaking Ulrich’s smooth groin in the process.

 

“She’s crying out so desperately.”

 

“Nngh, ah, ah, ah…!”

 

“How can you say it’s just me enjoying myself?”

 

The deep, gruff voice, broken up by the rhythm of his thrusts, sounded almost like a criticism forced through gritted teeth.

 

Ulrich acted as if he had forgotten that his mother was present. His relentless movements, more akin to a beast devoid of humanity, were calculated and precise, driving his hips with quick, sharp thrusts.

 

With every creaking motion of their joined lower bodies, their senses were shamelessly overwhelmed. This applied not only to the two participants but also to Mrs. Altahart, who stood by the bed, observing.

 

Lisbell could feel her nerves being overly stimulated, making her shiver all over. Her mind, already lost in a mix of pleasure and shame, was overwhelmed by the burning embarrassment deep within her. Her senses had become so heightened that she could now vividly feel even the slightest touch on her skin. With her lower body being pounded so hard, it was impossible to maintain her composure.

 

“Ngh, ah, ah, mm, ah…!”

 

“You’re sucking it in so greedily because you want me to come inside, right?”

 

Ulrich couldn’t escape the heat searing through his lower body either. Instead, he indulged in his lewd desire, driving his hips more lewdly to expose his obscene hunger.

 

He grabbed Lisbell’s bouncing hips, guiding her down to ensure his mother had an unobstructed view of their intimate connection.

 

Thanks to this, Mrs. Altahart could see her son’s swollen cock, veins throbbing, driving into the soft, yielding flesh of Lisbell’s entrance. The loud, resonating slaps of flesh echoed in the room, punctuating each thrust with enough force to ring in the ears.


After a while, Ulrich thrust with such force that Lisbell’s back arched off the bed.

 

The fact that they reached climax simultaneously was evident in Lisbell’s reaction. She tensed her entire body, curling up tightly as if pulling herself inward. Her body became so rigid that it couldn’t relax even with the slightest stimulation.

 

“Ah, ahh…”

 

Lisbell let out a voice that sounded like she was crying and pushed his hand away from her abdomen. She flailed her limbs, trying to get off him. Ulrich wrapped his arm around her neck, pulling her back toward him, but Lisbell resisted, pushing against his chest with her palms.

 

Ulrich applied pressure and then released it. As a result, Lisbell tumbled onto the bed. She hastily grabbed the sheets and glanced toward the door.

 

Her eyes, which had sparkled as if she found a lifeline, quickly lost their light.

 

A moment ago, Cora Altahart, who had been standing there watching the obscene scene unfold, had vanished without a trace. She had long since left, unable to tolerate the shameless behavior of her son. Like when she arrived, Lisbell, caught up in the intensity of Ulrich’s advances, hadn’t even noticed her departure.

 

“No…”

 

A raspy voice, hoarse from crying, came out in a rough whisper.

 

Whether it was the lingering sensation of the orgasm or the cold chill seeping into her sweat-drenched body, Lisbell trembled as a robe was draped over her naked form.

 

Who else could it be?

 

Of course, it was Ulrich, who was tending to her with surprising gentleness. He even helped her lift each of her limp arms to put on the robe, carefully pulling out the chain of the shackles so it wouldn’t be hidden, almost as if to show off a beautiful piece of jewelry.

 

During all this, Lisbell could only stare blankly at the door.

 

When Cora had appeared in the bedroom, Lisbell’s mind had been in utter chaos. It wasn’t because it was Cora, but because the fact that a private sexual act was being displayed to someone else shook her to her core.

 

But that was only momentary; her thoughts changed.

 

Now, trapped in this place to the point where she couldn’t even move freely, Lisbell had secretly wished for someone to come. Among those she hoped for was Cora Altahart.

 

Perhaps she wanted her the most, thinking that maybe Cora could control Ulrich.

 

Since the day after he had drugged her, Ulrich had barely left the bedroom. He handled most of his duties inside the room through documents brought by his secretary or via a phone installed inside. Even when he had to leave briefly, he didn’t go far and returned quickly.

 

Hadn’t she once thought that she was nothing more than a sex tool for his amusement?

 

In retrospect, that was a very wrong judgment. Such a description could only be applied now when her lower body was so sore it felt shredded.

 

Ulrich acted as if he believed that he might die if he left Lisbell’s body. He spent most of his time in the bedroom on the bed. Even when they weren’t having sex, he would hold her close, biting and sucking on her as he idly passed the day.

 

After Gwen’s funeral, the once relentless schedule seemed like a mere facade, as his private life became incredibly indulgent. And Lisbell, who was imprisoned by him, knew better than anyone the reason behind this sudden change in behavior.

 

That’s why she had waited for Cora. No one else would do. She desperately wanted someone who had equal or even slightly more authority than Ulrich in this mansion. For someone of that status to show up meant that they could no longer overlook Ulrich’s lethargic lifestyle.

 

‘Why…’

 

But even though Cora had appeared as Lisbell had wished, things didn’t go as she had hoped. For some reason, Cora had left without even arguing with her son. Seeing the empty spot where Cora had stood, Lisbell felt an overwhelming sense of emptiness gnawing at her heart.

 

So, Lisbell was left once again with this dreadful man and the even more dreadful shackles. In this incredibly spacious yet suffocatingly claustrophobic space.

 

That’s why her despair grew even more.

 

If even his own mother couldn’t control him, then who in the world could stop Ulrich?

 

Does such a person even exist in Rechem?

 

If there’s no one to rein in Ulrich’s inhumane acts, then what about me?

 

How much longer must I endure this?

 

“……!”

 

Lisbell flinched as she felt a hand on her shoulder. Clutching the robe tightly at her chest, she crawled backward to the edge of the bed. Ulrich, who had reached out to touch her disheveled hair, glanced at his empty hand before smiling faintly.

 

The next moment, he grabbed the chain connected to her shackles.

 

“Ah…!”

 

There was no need to struggle in vain. With a single pull of the chain, Lisbell was dragged back to him. The cruel force radiated malice. Whenever she resisted him like this, Ulrich would openly display his displeasure.

 

“Ugh…”

 

As the chain was pulled, the shackle naturally followed, dragging her neck along. The sensation was bone-chillingly painful, like poison seeping into her skin.

 

The feeling of being dragged by the neck was always eerie and grotesque. It made her feel less than human.

 

It was as if her very identity was being annihilated.

 

The taut chain slackened into a graceful curve. Just then, his clear sea-colored eyes were right in front of her.

 

Ulrich leisurely caressed her gaunt cheek with the back of the hand holding the chain. This affectionate touch was a repulsive display of his dominance. And, of course, what made this possible was the shackle around her neck.

 

“This…”

 

She knew it was useless.

 

“Please remove this.”

 

She knew, yet her mouth opened, and her tongue moved reflexively.

 

“Please, I beg you, take it off….”

 

How could she not, when the environment was unbearable otherwise?

 

Lisbell clutched the dark shackle around her neck, panting as if she couldn’t breathe. Ulrich’s elegant fingers lifted her chin.

 

“Not yet.”

 



 

“I still can’t be sure you won’t run away if I take this off.”

 

Recently, dealing with him felt like confronting a thick gray wall. No matter what she did, she couldn’t penetrate it, and no matter how hard she tried, she couldn’t overcome it.

 

Lisbell glared at him with cold, watery eyes, then grasped his wrist that held her chin.

 

“Then at least let me see my mother….”

 



 

“Please, just let me see her…. Please?”

 



 

“Everyone knows now…. They all know my mother is dead, so why won’t you let me see her? Why?”

 

The truth had already been revealed. Ulrich’s attempts to keep her from the hospital with flimsy excuses had been fully exposed.

 

Her mother’s life could no longer be used as leverage against Lisbell, and the scorching guilt had become a heavy lump buried deep in her gut.

 

So, wasn’t it only right that this living separation should come to an end?

 

But Lisbell still hadn’t seen a single strand of her mother’s hair. She was trapped, and her mother’s body was still in the hands of this vicious man. That was what hurt the most. That the last traces of her mother, who died in such loneliness, were still with this man.

 

So the fact that I must continue to submit to him…

 

“Why…”

 

Her voice trailed off, losing its strength.

 

Her thoughts, like rain-soaked papers, slowly descended into darkness. Each time she reached a dead end, her mind would inevitably bleach out.

 

But now, it wasn’t just an empty void.

 

“Why are you doing this to me…?”

 

The relationship with Theodore, the last moments of her mother’s life—none of it could be properly resolved, all because of this man’s deliberate actions. Her insides churned as if swallowing molten lava. Her chest felt like it was burning.

 

“Why are you doing this to me!”

 

This fierce emotion could only be explained by the sheer injustice she felt.


Tears burst out. Every time her chest filled with an unbearable heat, her tear glands reacted as if they were malfunctioning.

 

Even though Lisbell knew well by now that this man had a twisted fetish for seeing her cry, and despite her determination not to give him what he wanted, she couldn’t help herself.

 

Lisbell bit her lip until it bled and glared at him.

 

While she sat on the floor, unable to properly gather herself, shackled and naked, Ulrich lounged against a pillow as if relishing the afterglow of their intimacy. He reached out to gently touch her slender jawline.

 

When she tried to twist her head away, he tightened his grip.

 

Ulrich, worried her lips might bruise from the biting, softly slid his thumb between them. Her red-stained lips parted without resistance.

 

He pressed against the wet flesh inside with his fingertip, then let out a light sigh, as if he’d remembered something.

 

“I forgot to finish inside again.”

 



 

“I keep forgetting. It’s either I’m getting terrible memory loss at this age, or I just don’t want to leave Lisbell’s body.”

 

Crazy bastard.

 

Lisbell cursed him inwardly, noting his attitude of not even bothering to listen to her. Was he always like this? Did she think that talking to a wall would be more productive from the very first moment she met him?

 

No, there had been a time when he was capable of communication.

 

Back then, he had even blessed her marriage to Theodore, and offered the best room in his villa so she could spend quality time with her mother….

 

Those memories had become more distant and blurry than an old dream.

 

Ulrich picked up the robe he’d left on the side and draped it gently over Lisbell’s shoulders. Then, he calmly searched for and slipped on his trousers.

 

Lisbell, still glaring at him, threw off the robe he’d placed on her. Ulrich merely chuckled, as if finding her defiance adorable. His attitude only added to her frustration.

 

“You… you must be mistaken about something.”

 

He, now standing, pulled out a cigarette from a case, lit it, and looked back at her.

 

“I’m not the kind of woman who could interest you.”

 

“Hmm.”

 

He hummed an indecipherable sound and then smiled slyly, as if a thought had crossed his mind. Ignoring the smile that was digging into her core, she continued her words.

 

“I know well now how influential you are in the capital. You are more… powerful than I initially thought. There must be many women who, not caring about your name or background, would seek you out just to be with you. Surely. Am I wrong?”

 

“There probably are.”

 

Though his response was somewhat indifferent, Lisbell clenched her fists at the rare, straightforward answer.

 

“There must be women around you who are far more beautiful than someone like me, with prestigious families, who can actually help you. Turn your attention to them. Then you’ll realize how mistaken you are. You’ll see that every second you waste with a worthless woman like me is a second you’ll regret.”

 

“Did you meet with my mother behind my back?”

 

“…What?”

 

“Never mind.”

 

He smirked again and lit his cigarette.

 

She didn’t pay much attention to his seemingly random remark. She simply swallowed the blood-red tears rising inside. The self-esteem that Theodore’s warmth and kindness had once filled was now crumbling with every word she spoke.

 

But this was necessary. Even if it meant lowering herself this way, if it could free her from these shackles, she would do it as many times as needed, even if it meant biting her tongue.

 

It wasn’t a lie, either.

 

In front of the massive name of Altahart, she was less than a grain of sand. There was no reason to feel humiliated for stating aloud what everyone already sensed or suspected. Lisbell pulled herself together, trying to suppress her frayed nerves.

 

“Yes, that could be true.”

 

Her ribs caved inward.

 

The hope that was of no benefit now mischievously reared its head again. Ulrich’s attitude, which had been rather cooperative in conversation, was turning into a sweet torture for her, trapped in this situation.

 

In her suddenly lifted vision, Ulrich had drawn closer.

 

He sat on the bed and brushed back Lisbell’s disheveled gray hair. The faint smell of burning came from his fingers. Her heart trembled as she worried his cigarette might brush against her skin.

 

“But don’t you think that makes you necessary?”

 

Ulrich pressed her soft lips with his, wetting them with his tongue. If she resisted, the cigarette might end up shoved into her mouth. The vivid memory of him choking her made her fear that he would carry out the threat.

 

“We need to keep you close to determine whether this is a mere passing fancy or something more.”

 



 

“If what I feel for you is nothing but a fleeting interest that will fade away, or if….”

 

He stopped talking, rounded his pretty eyes, and smiled softly. That smile, like an invisible hand, pressed against Lisbell’s throat.

 

Feeling an inexplicable threat to her life, she slapped his hand away from her face. The cigarette dangling precariously fell and rolled under the bed.

 

A sharp pain spread across her fingers. She had burned herself on the cigarette in her haste to interrupt him. The sensation gnawed at her skin.

 

Before Lisbell could clasp her injured hand, Ulrich grabbed it. He held it as if exacting payment for her defiance, gripping it with frightening strength as he stared intently at her.

 

“Should I tell you how to make me lose interest?”

 

He stuck out his tongue.

 

The wet muscle licked the long burn on her reddened skin.

 

Lisbell let out a muffled groan from her lips. Despite that, she couldn’t take her eyes off the man in front of her. His next words, which she had waited for so anxiously, couldn’t be ignored.

 

He licked her wound as if gouging it out with his tongue. The nerves in her fingers all contracted at once. Ulrich finally took her entire finger into his mouth and sucked deeply.

 

He was clearly trying to break her from within, not just heal the wound. His deliberate delay as he sucked her burnt finger only reinforced the thought.

 

With a loud, wet pop, her finger finally slipped from his mouth. Ulrich licked his saliva-covered finger horizontally and smiled darkly.

 

“Accept the situation.”

 

A single invisible arrow pierced her briefly trembling heart.

 

“Surrender.”

 

He slowly released her hand. Lisbell recoiled, curling her hand inward like a bug under attack. The sticky texture of his saliva dripping along her fingers didn’t even bother her. All she could focus on was him.

 

“The more you resist and struggle, the more curious I become about how far you can go.”

 

He leaned in close to Lisbell. Close enough to kiss, their lips brushed lightly every time he spoke, like a feather touch.

 

Despite the soft flesh and the sensation of it pressing more softly than crushed velvet, the atmosphere remained as cold as a subzero winter.

 

The more I resist, the more I might attract his interest?

 

Looking back, Ulrich had always observed how she would react. Throwing her mother as bait, taking Theodore as a hostage. It seemed like he was silently watching how she would respond in those moments of choice….

 

“Watching you is… strange. It makes me feel both itchy deep inside and outrageously irritable at the same time. Sometimes, just touching your soft body is enough, but when you don’t go along with what I want, I get so annoyed that I feel like snapping that pretty neck of yours so I don’t have to care anymore.”

 



 

“I really don’t know what this is.”

 



 

“Lisbell, do you know?”

 

I don’t know.

 

All she felt was the chilling horror.

 

Even though no physical object touched her throat, she felt as if she were suffocating, as if an invisible curse had been placed on her, preventing her from breathing freely.

 

A memory surfaced of him holding a gun. His appearance was as cold and merciless as that of a hunter with no room for mercy.

 

Lisbell wiggled her toes against the bed sheets.

 

The invisible trap felt like it was closing in around her, threatening even her heartbeat. Her neck itched unbearably, as if cursed, knowing she couldn’t remove it on her own.
