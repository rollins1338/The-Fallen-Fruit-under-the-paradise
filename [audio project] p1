The Fallen Fruit Under the Paradise by Mongsu.
Part 1. Chapter 1 to Chapter 60.
Chapter 1.

Under the bright sunlight and vast meadows, in the
charming resort city of Southwest, Marnia, where a gentle
breeze tickles the green grass. The mansion built on its
quiet outskirts was famous as the twenty-third mansion of
the Altahart family, known as the prestigious name in
Rechem. The building, constructed in a unique style by an
architect, was so magnificent that it was more akin to a
fortress than merely a ‘mansion’, reflecting the unparalleled
status of the Altahart family in the great nation of Rechem.
Despite its grand construction, the mansion constantly
emanated a cold aura year-round, attributable to three main
reasons. First, every member of the family resided in the
townhouses of the capital. Second, the Altahart family
owned more than twenty other mansions across the
country, excluding this one in Marnia. Lastly, Marnia was too
mundane and dull for the family to leverage their greatest
strength, their astronomical wealth accrued since the
ancient era that ended the White War, through their
unrivaled intelligence network. For these reasons, the
Marnia mansion had been left vacant for quite some time.
Yet, cobwebs did not form, nor did dust gather on the
windowsills, thanks to the ever-present staff employed to
maintain the place in the absence of the owner.
The staff unanimously agreed that this mansion was the
best workplace in the world. There was no employer
watching their every move with hawk-like eyes, and despite
the given freedom, their salaries were absurdly high
compared to other jobs. Whether they had come knowingly
or stumbled upon it by chance, everyone hoped to stay here
for life.
In the morning, a pleasant breeze would blow between the
chirping sparrows, and by noon, the clear chimes of the
town’s church would ring. At night, the starry Milky Way
would spread blue across the ink-black sky. Marnia mansion
boasted such beautiful and serene scenery. There’s a saying
that boredom is a sweet punishment from God, but it did not
apply here in Marnia. Boredom was a great blessing.
Mrs. Osborne, now in her third year of working at Marnia
mansion, wholeheartedly agreed. The repetitive daily
routine was a rightful happiness. She arrived promptly at
seven o’clock to inspect the mansion diligently for any
issues. Ten minutes before noon, she headed to the
bedroom on the third floor, holding the mail delivered by a
beret-wearing postman on his bicycle. Upon entering the
bedroom, she went straight to the desk, using a paper knife
on a refined stand to open the sealed mail for the owner.
Then, the sound that awakened the city’s vigor was heard.
Ding-dong.
It signaled noon as the church bell started ringing from afar.
The clear, pleasant sound resonated like waves into the
wide-open bedroom. The second ring sounded unusually
loud due to the annoyed groan coming from the bed behind
the drawn curtains. After finishing with the mail, Mrs.
Osborne clasped her hands and took a few steps back.
And at the third ring, the curtain was roughly drawn back.
First to touch the floor were the two muscularly split legs
beneath a disheveled nightgown. 
“…Madam.”
The man’s voice, who had just woken up and was in a foul
mood, crawled on the floor as he covered his face with his
hand.
“How much should I pay to make that bell stop?”
It had been a month already. Since coming down to Marnia,
the man had been consistently disturbed from sleeping in
by the bell. The church bell, rung as a greeting to God,
tolled twelve times before stopping. Yesterday, he endured
until the fifth toll, but today it was only three. At this rate,
he might wake up even before the bell rings tomorrow.
“Good morning, Master,” Mrs. Osborne said, bowing calmly.
The man rubbed his temples, likely from a mild migraine,
causing his splendid platinum blonde hair to slightly shake.
“Yes, damn good morning indeed.”
The brilliance of his hair made her squint, but his face
exerted an even more refined allure. Even just awakened,
with not a drop of water touching him, his appearance was
captivating enough to draw every woman’s gaze. No need
to look far; Mrs. Osborne herself was mesmerized. She had
never seen such a beautiful man in her life. When he first
appeared at the mansion, she dared to think he was not the
owner of this magnificent second house but a typical
wandering poet living off his looks, who sweetly wooed
wealthy ladies and expertly swindled them. Of course, that
misconception was quickly dispelled by the luxurious car
that roared like a beast and the land ownership certificate
for this place from the car’s trunk.
Indeed, the long-abandoned Marnia mansion had suddenly
regained its owner overnight. A month ago, for some
reason, the second son of the family, Ulrich Altahart, had
descended here before dawn without any attendants.
With a dreamy look of someone not fully awake, Ulrich lazily
brushed up his hair, reminiscent of the soft sand on a beach.
Then he got up from the bed, lit a cigarette, and took a
drag. His sleepy eyes fell on the mail Mrs. Osborne had
placed down. He flicked through the mail with his fingers,
soon grabbing a tabloid from the bottom.
“Hmm.”
His well-shaped lips let out a short sigh. It was clear what he
was looking at. Mrs. Osborne had also read the article this
morning. The article, titled “A Nobleman’s Outing? Who Is
the Stranger at the Abandoned Mansion?” had a small
picture attached beneath it. It was a cropped photo of
Ulrich’s face from a family photo that every citizen of
Rechem would have seen at least once.
“These photos were not distributed to be used as tabloid
fodder.”
Showing near-disgust, he stubbed out his cigarette on his
face in the photo. His splendid, flawless face turned back to
Mrs. Osborne.
“Anyway, could you call the lawyer?”
“Yes, Master.”
It was an expected outcome. With this, the total number of
newspapers sued by him in Marnia alone reached three.
Judging by the situation, it seemed this newspaper, which
had dared to publish his article, would also end up
dissolving without a penny in compensation.
“Why can’t people just respect someone’s right to live
quietly?”
“Considering the family’s status, it’s only natural for
everyone to be interested.”
“Annoying Altahart fame.”
Ulrich threw the cigarette butt into the ashtray and sat on
the bed. Mrs. Osborne clasped her hands calmly as he
languidly gazed out the window, savoring his freedom here.
“Master, there was a call from the capital this morning.”
“Didn’t I cut all the phone lines?”
“Yesterday around noon, you called the capital’s law office
to check if the village church could be sued for noise
pollution.”
“Oh, right.”
Sighing at his forgetfulness, Ulrich looked back at her.
“What did they say?”
“The same question as before. When do you plan to return
to the capital?”
“That’s enough.”
Cutting off the conversation, Mrs. Osborne politely inquired
about meal plans and any specific instructions before
bowing respectfully.
“Master.”
“Yes?”
“I have a personal request for permission.”
“What is it?”
“I need to take a leave of absence for a while.”
“Leave of absence?”
“Yes.”
In his eyes that turned to her, there was a mix of curiosity
and subtle reproach. The reproach asked who would take
over the duties if the person managing the mansion took
leave, and the curiosity wondered about the reason despite
knowing this. With such blue-grey eyes questioning her,
Mrs. Osborne bowed deeply.
“My daughter is getting married soon.”

Chapter 2.
His eyebrows twitched, raised, and then returned to their
original position.
“You are a wife and you have a daughter?”
“Yes.”
A smile like a flower petal hit by iron appeared on the
woman’s face.
Although they had only been together for a month, Ulrich
had realized that she had a very rigid personality. Whether it
was because of her role as a general manager or her
inherently rigid nature, her laughter was often so faint that
it was hard to tell if she was really laughing.
So, just seeing that rare smile, he could guess how much
she cherished her daughter.
“This time, she is officially getting married to her fiancé.
After the wedding, she plans to leave for a foreign country
with her fiancé, so I would like to take a leave to spend time
with her before that.”
Mrs. Osborne’s leave had been planned for quite some time.
There was no problem with the process.
Because the Marnia Villa, where she worked, did not have a
specific owner, it was not a big deal for her to leave her post
temporarily. In such cases, it was just a matter of calling the
relevant department of the main house, which supervised
the employment of the villa workers, and getting
permission.
However, coincidentally, the second son of the capital had
come down here. Since Ulrich was practically the owner and
employer, she felt it necessary to seek his approval first.
“Hmm, I see. Congratulations. It’s a family celebration.”
“Thank you.”
“But what about me?”
Ulrich raised his chin. His playful attitude, slightly wrinkling
his brow, did not allow the other person to feel any such
emotion.
In Ulrich’s pupils, an unwelcome expression surfaced.
He didn’t particularly like his surroundings to change. More
precisely, he didn’t prefer the environment he liked to
change without his consent.
Whether it was people or things.
Even though it had only been a month, Ulrich didn’t find
Mrs. Osborne to be too bad. She was quick-witted and wellbehaved, and didn’t particularly bother him in the
countryside villa where he came with no expectations.
Her leaving wasn’t the problem. The problem was the
possibility of someone replacing her whom he might not
like.
His question was short and quite self-centered, in line with
this thought process.
Mrs. Osborne couldn’t find words and just moved her lips.
She seemed flustered by the unexpected situation.
Watching her, Ulrich got up from the bed and walked to the
open window.
The sound of bells had long ceased. With that, the natural
sounds of the pure city were pushed by the wind and came
inside.
“Where are you planning to spend time with your
daughter?”
“I was planning to go to Misley since I was taking a leave.”
“Misley.”
Ulrich lightly nodded and spread his arms wide to grasp the
window frame. His broad shoulders seemed to fill the
window, emphasizing his presence. His manly physique
enhanced his delicate appearance, giving it a more
mysterious atmosphere.
“Hmm.”
Ulrich tapped his fingers on the window frame. Soon, he
turned around with a leisurely movement as if dancing a
waltz. Leaning diagonally against the window frame, there
was a sense of relief in his gaze toward her, as if he had
found a solution.
“Instead, how about calling your daughter here?”
“Pardon?”
“Marnia is also a suitable city for a vacation.”

“I think it would be nice for the mother and daughter to
spend good time together here.”
They said the world of the rich revolves solely around their
own comfort. Despite appearing generous, there was a
hidden selfishness aiming at their own benefit.
Ulrich was like that now. It was just that his elegant
demeanor filtered it in a way that didn’t seem crude.
Mrs. Osborne quickly caught on to this aspect.
She had already heard about it.
Following the second son of the family who arrived at the
dawn’s light to Marnia, his secretary had advised her that
Ulrich’s stubbornness was unmatched. Therefore, she was
urged to serve him well to avoid any unnecessary friction.
It wasn’t just words.
As a member of the wealthiest family in Rechem, her basic
salary had been tripled. Perhaps because it was a family
built on piles of greed, they could immediately grasp what
others desired and use it without leaving room for
complaints.
“If you agree, I will cover all the expenses for any leisure
activities you and your daughter do here.”
“It’s a very generous offer, but honestly, I don’t know if it’s
necessary for you to go that far.”
“You might not understand, but for me, this is the simplest
way.”
Ulrich crossed his arms and smiled lightly.
“It’s just about buying any possible variables with money.”
“…..”
“That’s the favorite solution of my family.”
There seemed to be a faint trace of disgust behind his
smiling face.
Mrs. Osborne maintained a calm demeanor, unsure whether
to be grateful or bewildered.
“I think it’s a very gracious offer. However, I should consider
my daughter’s opinion as well. Could I get back to you after
contacting her?”
“Sure.”
Ulrich, who was looking at the vast green plains outside,
nodded absentmindedly and then uttered an exclamation.
Mrs. Osborne, who was about to leave, turned to look at
Ulrich.
With a proud smile, he opened his mouth.
“What’s your daughter’s name?”
*
“Lisbell!”
It was a moment when the fresh laughter of the children
surrounding the classic piano filled the air.
From afar, a loud voice calling her could be heard.
Lisbell’s hands, which were energetically playing on the
keyboard, stopped first, and then her head turned towards
the door. At the end stood her fiancé, Theodore.
“Theo.”
She jumped up with a lively greeting, and the eyes of the
children around the piano followed her. In the next moment,
the group moved to the door with a loud cheer.
Theodore handed small candies to the orphans who quickly
gathered around him, smiling kindly.
“I’ve told you many times, if you all rush over like this, you
might fall.”
Theodore’s words made the children laugh even more. As
she watched with a smile, Theodore looked up as if he felt
her gaze. His light brown hair swayed in the wind blowing
through the door.
“Lisbell, let’s head to the station. Time is tight.”
“Yes, we should.”
“The kids asked you to play the piano again, didn’t they?
Really.”
“Don’t be like that. I offered to play for them.”
The children, who were watching the conversation with their
necks stretched, chimed in with “Yeah,” “She said she
would,” and “You always tell us off” competing to speak
first.
With so many of them, it quickly became noisy. Feeling
awkward, Theodore clapped his hands.
“Alright, your favorite Lisbell has to leave now. You can listen
to the rest of the music when she returns from her trip.”
Before the children’s demands got any longer, Theodore
took Lisbell out of the chapel. Her luggage bag, placed in
front of the chapel bench, was already moved by Theodore.
“Shall we go now? It’s quite tight to get to the station on
time.”
Holding Lisbell’s hand after taking the bag with one hand,
Theodore intertwined their fingers and lightly kissed his
lover’s cheek.
As they walked together, they chatted.
“Mrs. Osborne knows you’re leaving today, right?”
“Yes. I talked to her a few days ago.”
“I was really surprised. I thought she would come here, but
suddenly you’re going to Marnia.”
“Tell me about it. I was surprised too.”
Lisbell giggled.
Yes, who would have known she would suddenly go to
Marnia?
The reason for this change was not her or her mother, but
her mother’s employer, who had appeared out of nowhere.

Chapter 3.
A week ago, I received a call from my mother, who manages
an empty villa in Marnia.
The conversation lasted longer than expected, but the gist
was this:
A month ago, the villa’s owner had to come to Marnia
urgently. He expressed a desire for the caretaker not to
leave her position, and in that vein, he suggested that if it
was acceptable, why not have Lisbell come to Marnia and
spend some time together.
The subtle persuasion underlying this proposal was the
constant financial struggle that had accompanied the
mother and daughter up to this point.
In truth, Mrs. Osborne was skeptical about spending time
with her daughter before the wedding. It wasn’t that she
disliked spending time with Lisbell, but she was worried
about the expenses that would naturally follow.
The concern wasn’t lost on her daughter, Lisbell, who,
despite having a father who owned a fairly large factory in
their hometown, was still significantly disadvantaged as she
was raised in a modest single-parent household.
Mrs. Osborne had saved diligently for Lisbell’s college
education, and Lisbell had juggled various part-time jobs
during her semesters as a library assistant and as a tutor
during breaks, all to save for the future.
Despite their hard work, the thought of spending part of
their savings on making memories before the wedding was
a burden for Mrs. Osborne.
It seemed as if the villa’s owner had seen right through Mrs.
Osborne’s concerns. He offered to cover all expenses if they
spent time in Marnia.
My mother said it was up to me, but she subtly hinted that
she hoped I would follow the owner’s wishes. Understanding
her feelings well, I chose to go to Marnia.
“Did you say the villa owner is from the famous Altahart
family?”
“Yes.”
“Wow, that’s impressive. It’s incredible that your mother
works so closely with someone like that.”
“My mother has been at that villa for three years, and this is
the first time she’s seen him. She said she was quite
surprised when he showed up without any prior notice.”
“Well, nothing is really known about that family. Honestly,
before you mentioned it, I wasn’t even sure they were real
people. Although their business dealings flood the financial
news, there’s never any information about their personal
lives.”
Altahart’s family was famously wealthy, but very little was
known about its members.
The only public information about them was a single blackand-white family photo.
“Except for that odd rumor about the eldest son.”
“Odd rumor?”
“You know, the recent gossip about the Altahart eldest son
being gay. It caused quite a stir because it came out when
he was supposed to be engaged to the Schwaben family’s
daughter.”
I remembered that incident.
It was the first time a private matter about the family had
leaked. It created a buzz in places like the capital, Laurent,
and even in our quiet town of Misley.
Private newspapers didn’t miss the chance to spread the
story. I vaguely recalled seeing a similar headline on a
tabloid when I was at the square.
“But then the story disappeared overnight, leaving rumors
that someone envious of the family spread the gossip on
purpose.”
The social circles in the capital were ruthless, and Theo
shook his head as he looked at me.
“Anyway, Lisbell, you’re going to meet someone from that
amazing family.”
“I suppose so.”
Theo, curious and excited, kept chattering away, and I
responded with occasional smiles and nods.
We arrived at the Misley station by carriage. Theo was right;
we were cutting it close. As I took the bag he handed me, I
glanced at the main clock on the platform.
“Thanks for bringing me, Theo.”
In front of the open train door, Theo took my hand and
kissed my white knuckles.
“Travel safely, Lisbell.”
“Please convince your mother. I know you can do it.”
Knowing the purpose of my trip, Theo gave me his heartfelt
encouragement. His warmth reached me, and I winked at
him in gratitude.
“See you when I get back.”
Indeed, when I returned, our planned wedding would be one
step closer.
His eyes sparkled with cherry blossom-like excitement.
Feeling my heart flutter, I boarded the train.
I saw Theo waving outside as the train slowly departed. I
waved back with a bright smile.
The scenery blurred as the train gained speed. The platform
where the train had briefly stopped became a speck. Letting
go of the mixed feelings of regret and anticipation, I moved
to my seat as indicated on my ticket.
I carefully took my seat. Across from me sat two elderly
gentlemen who seemed to be traveling together. One wore
a fedora and was reading a newspaper, while the other, with
an unlit pipe, gazed out the window.
“Look at this.”
“Hmm? What is it?”
The man in the fedora handed the newspaper to his
companion, who leaned in to read. His eyes moved busily as
he took in the content.
“Ha, Altahart again?”
“Is there ever a financial page without news about them?”
“True… So, another hotel is opening in the capital?”
“It seems so, but they’re differentiating it from their existing
hotels.”
“Where, where…”
“Here, look at this part.”
“A special suite available only to VIPs?”
The man with the pipe sounded incredulous.
“The price is over three times that of a regular room. Who
would spend such a fortune for just one night?”
“If it’s an Altahart venture, it could work. Here, it says they
plan to link the accommodation with the Alstad department
store.”
“Targeting the wealthy, I see. Well, they say money begets
money, and there’s no lie in that.”
By chance, they were discussing Altahart. Their
astonishment showed how another venture by this
prominent family was expanding in a unique way.
It was no surprise. The foundation of every new business in
the capital had been laid by the Altahart family. They were
pioneers of wealth. Other families with companies were left
scrambling to catch up, tearing their pants in the process.
Altahart.
Leaning against the window, I whispered the distant name
to myself. Theo’s previous conversation and the reactions of
the gentlemen before me made the name ‘Altahart’ seem
like a surreal reality.
Everyone knows, yet no one truly knows.
That was the consensus and the general perception of the
name ‘Altahart.’
There was a clue in the conversation I had with Theo.
While everyone was aware of the comprehensive businesses
they ran and the enormous wealth they accumulated, very
little was known about the individual family members. What
was known was limited to a group photo, the names, ages,
and the business each member managed. That was the
extent of what the capital’s newspapers covered.
In other words, their private lives were never covered by
any major newspaper.
This indicated that the Altahart family had the power to
control the media in the capital.

Chapter 4.
They too were people who lived day by day, and indeed,
there was a life that existed. Especially because of the
prestige and value of the family, they must have attracted
countless curiosities.
Therefore, naturally, such a conclusion follows.
Despite the attention that would follow even the slightest
finger movement, the reality of no private life exposure at
all suggested that this was also their power and strength.
“Somehow… I’m getting nervous.”
Lisbell rubbed her side hair against the window.
Right now, the thought of meeting someone whose name
inevitably comes up no matter where you are in the country
made her heart thump lightly.
The train crossed rapidly towards the southwest.
Lisbell spent a long time on the train, taking brief naps,
composing a piano piece for the orphans at Misley, and
leisurely observing the outside scenery.
The distance to Marnia was quite far, so she had to transfer
trains once. Since it wasn’t a city with overnight operations,
she had no choice but to stay at a shabby inn near the
station and board the train again the next morning.
Just when her body could no longer endure the stiffness, she
finally arrived in Marnia.
Perhaps because it was a place known for being a resort
city, a pleasant breeze enveloped her whole body as soon
as she left the station.
Lisbell opened her luggage and took out a notebook. After
firmly memorizing the address she had carefully noted
during her phone call with her mother, she quickly walked to
where the carriages were.
The path she found by asking around wasn’t boring. The
sights of Marnia, which she was seeing for the first time in
her life, made it so. As she passed through the bustling city
streets lined with government offices responsible for the
city’s circulation and shops that enliven the residents, a vast
open meadow unfolded.
The green grass swayed slowly to the left and right in the
wind. It looked like a giant green wave. The landscape that
naturally made her curl her fingers into a fist was like a
scene from a fairy tale.
It wasn’t long before Lisbell got off the carriage.
Beyond a path that seemed to be led by trees, part of an
unmistakable mansion could be seen.
Keeping her eyes on that trace, she walked diligently, and
soon the path ended. At the same time, what appeared was
a huge iron gate surrounding the mansion.
And in front of it was,
“Mother.”
Perhaps because she had informed her in advance about her
expected arrival time, Mrs. Osborne had come out to meet
her.
With a smile, Lisbell ran towards her. Her mother, extending
her arms, embraced the daughter who had come a long
way. From the hands patting her back, a warmth that she
could always feel transferred.
“Have you been well?”
“Of course. It must have been hard to come all the way
here.”
“No, not really. On the way here, I thought it was rather
fortunate that you didn’t come to Misley. I had to transfer
trains and sit continuously, so my back got really stiff. I
think it was better that I came.”
“Did you? Let’s go inside first.”
Mrs. Osborne, who stroked her talkative daughter’s cheek,
took Lisbell’s luggage, which had been set aside for their
reunion.
Lisbell declined, saying she was fine, and took it back
herself. Then, she carefully began to speak.
“You seem to have lost a bit of weight since I last saw you at
the graduation ceremony. Are you feeling unwell?”
“I’m perfectly fine.”
Mrs. Osborne, calming her concerned daughter with a gentle
smile, headed inside the gate. Lisbell followed her.
“How is Theodore doing?”
“He’s fine. He wanted to come with me this time too, but it’s
a very busy period at the orphanage because of an
inspection, so we couldn’t both leave.”
“Haha, he’s still so diligent, isn’t he?”
“Yes, he kept asking me to convey his regards to you.”
Even just the land outside the gate seemed vast and open,
and the garden inside was no different. So, as Lisbell and
her mother chatted, she looked around here and there.
Noticing her daughter’s curiosity, Mrs. Osborne briefly
explained the layout of the garden.
The pavilion wrapped in decorative rose vines, the silverframed fountain with sparkling water flowing as if brought
from the sea, the statue with clear relief, and the greenishyellow car parked beyond.
And finally,
Droplets leaped into the air.
The lively spray felt refreshing and cool, and only when it
did she discover the swimming pool basked in full sunlight.
“We should greet him first.”
Mrs. Osborne pointed at the swimming pool with her eyes
and led the way. Lisbell swallowed nervously as she
followed.
The water surface moved as if alive.
The energy slicing through the water was powerful yet
relaxed. Broad shoulders and white skin supporting them
briefly appeared and then disappeared with the fierce
bubbles.
Soon, a sound of liberation echoed as someone emerged
from the water. The droplets that splashed made Lisbell’s
mind suddenly clear as if she were drenched.
The form gradually took shape over clear eyes.
Platinum blonde hair, still wet from the water, clung faintly,
and the well-defined abs of his upper body became more
prominent.
The noon sunlight made the water covering him sparkle.
Maybe that’s why he seemed to sparkle so much.
Finding his long hair cumbersome, the man brushed it back
to reveal his forehead and turned toward the source of the
sound.
Instantly, their eyes met.
At the same time, the massive bell sound rang out as if it
would shake the earth.
Although she knew it was the church’s device set to ring at
regular intervals, her heart pounded because the sound of
the bell and the shock she received felt similar.
He was an incredibly beautiful man.
If he had stayed still, she would have believed he was a
sculpture crafted by a god.
But he was undoubtedly real.
The playful action of scrunching his eyes and covering his
ears as if annoyed by the loud bell proved it.
Of course, Lisbell had already seen his face in the
newspapers.
But the feeling was completely different.
The small, black-and-white, low-resolution newspaper photo
couldn’t capture the man before her. Words like
“remarkable” or “handsome” that people said after the
photo was released were insufficient to describe him.
The man swam towards the safety ladder at the edge of the
pool. As he climbed up, his exposure, already leaving no
room for her eyes, became even more noticeable.
Despite standing in front of others with only his lower half
covered, he showed no signs of shrinking.
While Lisbell’s eyes rolled in embarrassment, Mrs. Osborne
quietly moved. She approached the man with a towel
prepared by the pool and draped it over his shoulders. The
man bent slightly to accept it naturally.
By then, the bell sound had been forgotten.
“Lisbell?”
The man, shaking his wet platinum blonde hair, approached
her. Hearing her name from his mouth felt surreal. As she
pondered his identity, the man casually extended his hand.
“Nice to meet you. I’m Ulrich Altahart.”
The elegant baritone voice created by his rolling tongue
awakened the bewildered Lisbell. Only then did she realize
he was offering a handshake and hurriedly accepted it.
“N-nice to meet you. I’m Lisbell Osborne. I was honored to
receive an invitation through my mother.”
Ulrich smiled, crinkling his delicate eyes at her timid voice.
He tightened his grip on her hand momentarily before
releasing it.


Chapter 5.
A gaze that was close to searching wandered across Lisbell’s
face.
“Miss Lisbell looks just like her mother.”
Ulrich monotonously whispered as he released the hand he
had once gripped tightly.
“Every time I see your mother, I think she has a very
classical beauty.”
“That’s too kind of you.”
It was Mrs. Osborne, not Lisbell, who responded to the
compliment, as if it were not something she could refuse.
Ulrich shrugged and turned his back after giving her a
glance.
He approached the pergola shaded by a thousand threads of
fabric, removed his towel, and donned a housecoat. Then,
he took a cigarette from the case on the table and lit it.
There was no urgency in his actions until he lit the cigarette.
He seemed accustomed to making the person waiting for
his next words endure, his every gesture exuding a leisurely
air.
“I don’t know how long you’ll be staying here, but I’ve asked
them to give you the best guest room, so please rest
comfortably.”
Leaning against the table, he exhaled smoke and gently
curved his mild eyes.
Lisbell quickly bowed her waist.
“Thank you for your consideration.”
“Don’t mention it. I heard you’re soon to be married to your
fiancé.”
“Oh….”
“Hm? Is that not the case?”
“Oh, no. That’s right.”
She was slightly surprised that her mother’s employer knew
such details. She had not expected an employer of
Altahart’s stature to be so caring as to know every detail
about his employees.
He smiled brightly at Lisbell’s confirmed answer, waving his
hands. He swept up his still-wet hair.
“When do you plan to have the ceremony?”
“Probably around August… I think.”
“August.”

“You’ll be a bride in late summer.”
He spoke softly as he stubbed out the cigarette in a crystal
ashtray after taking a few more puffs with a nonchalant
attitude.
“Congratulations on your wedding in advance.”
Ulrich, who had briefly concluded the conversation,
straightened his leaning body.
The muscles of his chest, faintly visible through the parted
robe, were taut. It was a wild aspect that did not match his
elegant and handsome appearance.
“Mrs. Osborne, after you take care of my meal today, feel
free to spend your time as you wish. It wouldn’t make your
daughter, who has come from far away, feel neglected.”
“Are you going to the study?”
“Yes. If the review of the documents is delayed any further,
Loisden will come down here to devour me alive.”
He turned toward the pool, muttering that it was best to
avoid troublesome matters. Then, he waved his hand to the
two women in a lighthearted manner more fitting for a child.
The grace he had exuded earlier momentarily disappeared.
Mrs. Osborne respectfully bowed to that leisurely figure.
Lisbell, standing beside her, followed suit, bowing
inadvertently. A faint chuckle came from the retreating man.
With the villa’s owner gone, Lisbell followed her mother into
the shaded mansion.
She had thought it was appropriately sunny for noon, but
inside the building, it felt slightly chilly.
The interior was just as luxurious as the exterior. Despite
having been neglected for a few years, the mansion had
been under strict management for the past month since its
owner returned.
“This is the room you’ll be staying in.”
“Where will you be staying, Mother?”
“I usually use the attached annex next door, but while
you’re here, I’ve been allowed to stay with you. It’s the
room right next door.”
Relieved, Lisbell set down her luggage and looked around
the room.
She realized that when they said they were giving her the
best guest room, it wasn’t just words. The room was
exceedingly luxurious for the daughter of an employee. The
selection and placement of the furniture, decorations, and
even the size of the room showed great care.
It was a room fit for a noble young lady coming to enjoy a
party, not just an ordinary person’s daughter.
“You must be hungry after the long journey. Shall I prepare a
meal?”
“Yes, that would be nice. Can we eat together?”
“After I serve the master. Can you wait until then?”
“Of course.”
Lisbell replied cheerfully and sat on the bed. Unlike the
dormitory bed from her college days or the orphanage bed
she currently stayed in, it made no creaking sound. It must
be very expensive.
“Mother…”
“Yes?”
Mrs. Osborne, who was closing the curtains to block the
sunlight from her daughter, turned her head.
“Is he really that Altahart?”
“Yes.”

“Why do you ask?”
“He feels a bit different from what I imagined.”
Lisbell lowered her gaze. Mrs. Osborne, guessing what her
daughter was thinking, silently smiled.
“Yes, I felt the same way.”

“Because there’s so little known about him, there are bound
to be preconceived notions. He seems a bit unique, but he
doesn’t seem like a bad person.”
“Yes. Just seeing how he cares for us.”
Lisbell looked at her mother. Her purple eyes, like frozen
purple blossoms, sparkled transparently.
“Is there anything I should be particularly careful about
while I’m here?”
“Well… I haven’t been given any specific instructions, but
we should avoid doing anything that might upset the
master.”
“Yes, I will.”
“You must be tired from the journey. Rest while I take care of
the master’s meal.”
Mrs. Osborne gently stroked Lisbell’s shoulder and left the
room. Lisbell approached the window.
While Mrs. Osborne thought this meeting was just to create
one last memory before the wedding, Lisbell had a different
purpose.
After marrying Theodore, Lisbell planned to move to another
country with him. They dreamed of establishing a primary
school in a remote area to teach the growing children.
It was a dream she had held since entering college. Even
when she kept it to herself, her mother, Mrs. Osborne, was
always part of that vision.
However, she realized it was just her own bright wish during
a conversation with her mother before graduation.
Her mother, who Lisbell expected would follow her, refused.
She declared she would stay in Marnia and continue
managing the villa.
“Why, Mother?”
“Your marriage is your future and hope, not mine. Lisbell, I
am very happy just knowing I raised you to this point. I think
it’s wonderful that you’ve grown up so well without a father.
So, when you create a new family independent of me, I want
to remain here as a place you can always return to. As your
hometown and starting point.”
At that time, Lisbell couldn’t understand why her mother
wouldn’t choose to live with her.
But over time, she began to understand.
Lisbell knew better than anyone the burden her mother bore
raising her alone. She knew it must have been a difficult
process, one that couldn’t be handled with ordinary
affection.
Her mother’s maternal love was still strong, and now she
couldn’t bring herself to burden her daughter.
As people age, the weight of life increases. There are more
places to hurt and more things to care about. Her mother
couldn’t shake the thought that all future hardships would
burden Lisbell.
As she began to understand this, she had to step back but
couldn’t completely give up.
After graduating from university last winter, Lisbell and
Theodore stayed at a small orphanage in Misley, constantly
pondering. She still wanted to take care of her mother
closely. Theodore agreed with her.
“I hope you can persuade her. You can do it.”
The encouragement Theodore gave at the station
strengthened her resolve.
So, Lisbell was determined to persuade her mother during
this trip.
“…Hah.”
But upon arriving and seeing Altahart’s villa, her
determination began to waver. As she had anticipated, it
was too good a workplace to give up just for relocation.
If the employer had been bad and ill-tempered, she could
have used that as a reason to persuade her mother, but
there was nothing unpleasant about the man she met today.
Rather, he was so kind that she felt naturally inclined to bow
to him.
There was no need to recall the recent memories; even her
mother’s words reflected it.
When a subordinate says, “He’s not a bad person,” it means
he’s truly good.
Lisbell pressed her forehead against the glass, staring
blankly.
Even the migrating birds flying across the sky seemed
peaceful. It felt like the first day at Altahart’s villa would
pass quite blandly.

Chapter 6.

As the sunlight pierced through her eyelids, Lisbell
reluctantly woke up.
With a long yawn, she brushed her messy, tangled hair
aside. Her fine, curly hair often got tangled while she slept.
It was a feature she didn’t particularly like when she was
younger, but she didn’t mind it as much now.
“Why don’t you like it?”
“It takes so long to fix. Other girls can just smooth their hair
down with their hands, but I can’t do that.”
“I always thought it was adorable, like a little cloud.”
Ever since Theodore had said that with a shy smile, the curls
didn’t seem so bad. Though her hair was more like rain
clouds with its light ash color than fluffy white clouds, being
called cute made her heart flutter.
“Mmm…”
Stretching, Lisbell turned her head to look out the window.
It was the third morning in Marnia.
After a quick wash, Lisbell checked the time.
Seeing that it was still before noon, she knew her mother
would be busy with her duties as the villa caretaker.
According to what she had heard yesterday, today was the
day supplies were delivered, so her mother would be
occupied with sorting them all morning.
Although they had come to Marnia for a vacation together,
her mother had to continue managing the villa. The
employer, who wasn’t pleased with her mother’s absence,
had agreed to cover the expenses in exchange for this
condition.
It wasn’t an uncomfortable arrangement for Lisbell or Mrs.
Osborne.
This was a good deal for both Lisbell and Mrs. Osborne.
Having one more person at the villa didn’t significantly
increase her mother’s workload.
This meant that once the essential tasks were done, Mrs.
Osborne had plenty of free time.
Having dinner together until late into the night two days ago
and enjoying a barefoot walk along the beach yesterday
were results of this freedom.
I’m not sure, but…
He doesn’t seem to be a bad person.
Despite asking if there were any precautions she should
take upon arrival, Lisbell hadn’t seen the man since that
first day.
Seeing her mother occasionally leaving to attend to him
made it clear that he was staying at the villa. However, due
to different routines or perhaps to avoid disturbing their
mother-daughter time, they had not run into him even by
chance.
Looks like I have some time left.
Her mother’s tasks would take a bit longer to complete.
Wondering how to pass the time, Lisbell remembered the
library she had discovered while exploring the villa
yesterday.
She hadn’t been warned against entering any specific areas.
So, she decided that borrowing a few books wouldn’t be a
problem and left her room with enthusiasm.
The morning library was quiet.
Lisbell moved silently among the bookshelves. Thanks to
her studies in humanities, she recognized many author’s
names and titles.
She hadn’t expected much from the library of a villa, but
there were quite a few good books. Her initial plan to
quickly grab a few books turned into a full exploration,
examining each neatly arranged book.
“If you keep going, the day will break before you know it.”
Her hand, which was brushing the spines of the books,
froze. Lisbell quickly withdrew her hand and turned around.
The first thing she noticed was the bright platinum blonde
hair. Ulrich was sitting at a desk, backlit by the window,
gazing at her with his chin in his hand. Shocked to realize
someone else was there and then recognizing him as the
villa’s owner, whom she hadn’t seen for three days, Lisbell
pressed herself against the bookshelf.
“Oh, I’m sorry.”
He tapped the desk with a fountain pen and squinted at her.
“Did I say something to apologize for?”
“Well… it looks like you’re working, and I interrupted you.”
“You were moving so quietly, though.”
“…”
“I was just thinking you were like a cat.”
“…”
“If you had kept going, I might have checked under your
skirt to see if you had a tail.”
He must be joking, right?
Unsure of his intentions, Lisbell gave an awkward smile.
Ulrich responded with a faint smile as if acknowledging her
reaction.
He lowered his hand from his chin and crossed his arms.
“Is the selection not to your liking?”
“Pardon?”
“I thought I stocked it with quite rare books. Even some not
registered in the Royal Capital Library.”
“No…! As you said, there are many good books, so I was
just taking my time looking.”
“I see.”
Ulrich stood up from his chair. With a few long strides, he
was already beside her. 
It seemed he intended to choose books for her, running his
long fingers along the book spines.
The difference in their height was apparent. The fifth shelf
was the highest Lisbell could reach on her tiptoes, but the
third shelf was easy for him, and he could probably reach
the first shelf without effort.
“Mrs. Osborne must be busy?”
He asked, his voice resonating in the quiet room, making
her eardrums itch.
“Yes. Today is the day supplies arrive from outside…”
Ulrich chuckled. His eyes twinkled with mischief as he
looked at her.
“Someone might think you’re a worker here, Lisbell,
knowing things even I don’t.”
He picked a book and placed it in her arms. The title was
*Why Cats Raise Their Tails*.
“I heard it from my mother yesterday. She mentioned she’d
be busy all morning…”
“So, you came to the library.”
“Yes, that’s right.”
Tak, Tak
As she inspected the books he added to her pile, her
response became slightly delayed.
*The Nature of Cats*, *Things to Consider to Understand
Cats*.
Surely not, but Ulrich kept handing her books only about
cats. She had thought he was joking about the cat comment
earlier.
Unable to hide her confusion, Lisbell alternated between
looking at the books and the man in front of her, finally
speaking up.
“Um… I appreciate your recommendations, but…”
Ulrich, who had been grabbing another book, paused and
laughed. His laugh, which could have seemed frivolous,
didn’t come off that way due to his striking features.
Chuckling like a mischievous boy, he spoke in an
incredulous tone.
“Mr. Altahart?”
“What’s with that ridiculously formal title?”
“Well, um…”
“Why do you call me that?”
“Isn’t that how you should be addressed?”
“Well, yes, older business partners do.”
“…..”
“People your age call me by my first name.”
Ulrich watched her with amusement as she nervously bit her
lip, realizing he wasn’t entirely wrong.
Most people who called him by his first name right off the
bat had ulterior motives. They wanted to establish some
sort of connection, for social or business reasons.
In other words, Lisbell had no such hidden agenda. Instead,
she was clumsily drawing a line, maintaining a distance. Just
like a cat.
“You remember my first name, right?”
“Yes, of course.”
“Then use that.”
“…”
With his permission, there was no reason to hesitate, but
her lips felt heavy.
As she hesitated, Ulrich’s eyes narrowed. He began piling
more books into her arms. Eventually, he started pulling
them from the shelves in clusters.
It was clear what he wanted.
“Stop…! Ulrich, stop. That’s enough…!”
Only after hearing his name did he stop piling the books.
The stack of books was so high she could barely see his
face. Through her blurred vision, she saw him with a
satisfied, languid smile.
“Is this enough?”
“Yes, enough…”
As she answered, exhausted, he took the books back from
her arms.
“Why was that so hard? I’ve been calling you Lisbell from
the start, haven’t I?”
“…”
“By the way, Lisbell, your name sounds like a fruit.
Something easy to pluck and eat.”

“….What?”
“Your mother seems to have a talent for naming.”
I was dazed for a moment, wondering if I had heard
correctly. Ulrich’s face was suddenly too close, leaning
slightly towards me. Even from a distance, his appearance
was enough to make anyone lose their composure, so facing
him up close was unimaginably overwhelming.
“Your mother named you, right?”
“Oh, yes. That’s correct.”
“The name suits you well.”
“Thank you… very much.”
It felt like a storm had passed through my mind.
All I did was stand still and have a conversation, but why did
it feel so chaotic…
Eventually, everything returned to its place, and Lisbell, with
just a few books left in her arms, straightened her back.
Although it was done in a bit of a daze, she had chosen her
books. Just as she was about to say she would be leaving,
Ulrich reached out his hand. His beautiful finger even
tapped lightly on the book Lisbell was holding.
“Where are you going to read this?”
“Of course, in my room…”
“Why don’t you read it here?”
“What?”
Lisbell’s eyes widened like a rabbit’s.
“Why… why should I?”
She expressed her question as politely as possible,
wondering if there was any reason to do so.
“I’ve been getting a bit tired of working alone here.”
“…..”
“I think it would be nice if you could keep me company
occasionally, like now.”
“Me? Wouldn’t someone else be better suited for that?”
“Are you suggesting I bring in a servant? Then who would be
appropriate? Would Mrs. Osborne, who’s likely busy, be
suitable?”
His voice was as gentle as silk, but the underlying meaning
was quite different. His unyielding stubbornness was
beautifully wrapped, making it difficult to refuse.
After a moment of contemplation, Lisbell thought it was
better for her to spend time than to have her mother stand
guard, so she reluctantly shook her head.
Seeing her half-resigned demeanor, Ulrich smiled and led
her to the library table. It was placed in front of the desk
where he was sitting. He even pulled out a chair for her,
leaving no excuse for her to leave.
Lisbell was worried he might start spouting nonsense again,
but surprisingly, Ulrich focused straight on his work upon
returning to his seat. Glancing at him once or twice, Lisbell
cautiously opened her book.
Scratch, scratch.
Flip.
The sound of a fountain pen’s nib moving across paper and
the thin pages turning alternated. The breeze softly rustling
the closed window blended into the atmosphere, making
Lisbell feel why her mother always said over the phone,
“There’s no problem here.” She turned one page after
another, immersed in the tranquil environment.
At some point, the sound of the fountain pen stopped.
Realizing this subconsciously, Lisbell looked up and found
Ulrich staring at her. As soon as their eyes met, he asked,
“How do you feel about your upcoming marriage?”
Lisbell awkwardly scratched her neck, surprised by the
unexpected question.
“Actually… it still doesn’t feel real.”
She wasn’t just being coy. It was the truth. There was a time
when marriage felt like a distant matter, irrelevant to her.
When she occasionally thought about those days, it made
her feel detached from reality.
“Do you love your fiancé?”
The next question was rather direct. This time, she felt too
shy to speak.
But answers don’t always require words.
Ulrich expressed a faint gasp of amazement.
“Wow, you blush just thinking about him?”

“That’s quite pure love.”
Ulrich seemed genuinely fascinated by her visible devotion.
He rested his chin loosely on his clasped hands.
“How did you two meet?”
“We met during a university charity event.”
The two had no direct connection, being from different
departments, but the Misley Orphanage brought them
together. Instead of going home during the holidays, they
participated in charity work at Misley, and they grew closer.
At the time, Lisbell was responsible for basic math education
and music lessons using the piano, while Theodore handled
physical education and other tasks requiring strength.
Before they spoke, they were aware of each other’s
presence. One day, while Lisbell was secretly practicing the
piano in the chapel, Theodore approached her first.
From that day on, they greeted each other, dined together,
and had tea whenever they could, gradually developing
their relationship smoothly, as if it was destined from the
beginning.
“I heard you plan to leave the country with your fiancé after
the wedding.”
“Yes, we plan to run an elementary school there together.”
“An elementary school? So… you’re going to be a teacher?”
Lisbell laughed, slightly embarrassed, at Ulrich’s playful
tone, calling her “Teacher Lisbell.” Though shy, she didn’t
seem entirely displeased, as a faint blush appeared on her
cheeks. Ulrich, observing her healthy glow, chuckled softly.
“Do you like children?”
“Yes, of course.”
“Lisbell, you seem to have a lot of things you like.”

“The world must be enjoyable for you.”
The remark sounded a bit strange, causing Lisbell to stop
smiling and face him properly.
She wanted to read his expression, but it was difficult. The
light from the window behind Ulrich cast a shadow over his
face, making it look like a living shadow itself.
Feeling inexplicably parched, Lisbell hesitated before asking,
“Doesn’t that suit you more, Ulrich?”
Judging from the background alone, it seemed that way.
From her brief time at Altahart, Lisbell had vaguely grasped
the value and lifestyle it represented.
As the owner of such a luxurious estate, with many obedient
servants at his command and the ability to indulge in
whatever he wished whenever he wanted, it seemed like a
life lacking nothing.
It seemed too opulent for an ordinary person like her.
“Do I look happy?”

“Why do you think so?”

“Because I’m Altahart?”
He tilted his head slightly.
As the angle changed, the shadow covering Ulrich’s face
lifted. His expression was calm, almost disappointingly so,
making Lisbell’s concern about offending him seem
unwarranted. But it was so emotionless that it felt abrasive,
like sand covering a desert.
“Well, at least I have enough conscience not to say I’m
unhappy.”
Ulrich flipped over a document that had been on his desk.
“But Lisbell, do you know?”

“Curiosity and excitement stem from ignorance.”
His beautifully formed fingers gently folded the paper. Once
on one side, then the other, and several more times.
“Conversely, when ignorance disappears, it’s hard to feel
those things.”

“Everything in the world becomes trivial.”
After folding the paper for a while, he finally held it up. It
was shaped perfectly for flying.
Whoosh.
With a light flick, it floated through the air. The paper model,
fluttering aimlessly, landed between the pages of Lisbell’s
open book.
“When that happens, life becomes very…”
“…..”
“Very boring.”
The man’s compelling presence made it impossible for her
to look away, even from the paper model’s intrusion.
However, it was different from when she was simply
mesmerized by his looks.
Now, it was as if the subtly crafted smile reminded her of
earlier melancholy, appearing dangerously fragile. It was
hard to describe any other way.
“To the point where you’d want to kill yourself before turning
thirty.”
The calm remark turned her suspicion into certainty.
This present sense of despair was the abyss of a living man.
As if he wanted to hang himself out of sheer boredom with
the world, just as he said.

The atmosphere, which had changed in an instant, became
heavy, making her fingertips tingle.
An overwhelming wave of discomfort came over her. Her
thoughts dulled, unsure of what to say or how to respond.
Just as her lips were meaninglessly moving, trying to utter
something, the church bell chimed, marking noon,
enveloping the library.

It’s truly elegant.
Once again, doesn’t it seem as if my heart is being
helplessly crushed by that bell?
I felt strangely suffocated. No, it’s not even strange. After
all, the shocking words that would leave anyone stunned
came out of that noble-looking man’s lips with such
composure.
Didn’t he just say… suicide?
I didn’t hear it wrong.
The more I mulled it over, the clearer it became.
My chest tightened, as if a boulder I couldn’t possibly handle
had been placed on my outstretched palm, which I believed
would be light.
If Ulrich’s attitude had genuinely matched such heavy and
difficult emotions, things wouldn’t have turned so serious so
quickly.
He showed no significant change from earlier. His
indifferent, playful, somewhat relaxed and lukewarm
demeanor made it clear to Lisbell that he could carry out
what he said without hesitation.
As I couldn’t continue speaking, the bell kept ringing.
…Ten times, eleven times, twelve times.
The silence in the already quiet study deepened. The sound
of the bell filled the room, spreading widely and deeply, and
felt particularly stiff.
I reluctantly shifted my gaze from the window frame to him.
At that moment, Ulrich’s smile had completely changed.
From a cold sneer that felt icy even without touching it, to a
gentle form that seemed to carry the warmth of spring.
“It’s a joke.”

“Judging by your expression, I should choose my jokes more
carefully with you, Lisbell.”
He chuckled and shook his head.
The tension that had briefly filled me dissipated. Only then
could Lisbell manage an awkward smile in response.
“Oh, right. A joke.”
“Yes, a joke.”

“Bearing the name Altahart, I could never commit such a
disgraceful act.”
Flutter.
Ulrich’s tone, as he flipped through the documents, was
sharp. It seemed to carry a hint of subtle irritation, but his
smiling face made it hard to be certain. Lisbell had a feeling
that the man might be very adept at acting.
“By the way, it’s already noon.”
Ulrich, who had just signed the last document with a
flourish, rose from his seat. Lisbell also realized how much
time had passed and closed her book.
“I’ll go to my bedroom and get some sleep. I’ve been
getting up early for the past few days to catch up on work,
and my head feels constantly foggy.”
He yawned slightly, indicating it wasn’t just a comment.
“Could you tell Mrs. Osborne that I’ll be skipping lunch?”
“Oh, yes. I will.”
With a slight nod, Ulrich left the study first.
Hearing the door close, Lisbell stood up slowly, holding a
paper model she had taken out before closing her book.
She approached the desk, which had a peculiar order
despite appearing cluttered. Considering how well Ulrich
worked in this chaos earlier, there must be an unseen order
within the disorder. The ornate, gold-trimmed fountain pen
left uncapped was one such element.
Thinking vaguely, Lisbell carefully placed the folded paper
model next to it.
The shadow that fell to one side grew ominously dark.

The sound of the bells filled the chapel sweetly.
The rich array of notes blended with the light hitting the
stained glass, creating a dreamy sensation. This floating
feeling was the legitimate euphoria offered by the
mysterious power of religion.
On Sunday morning, I visited the church of Marnia with my
mother. We attended the regular service for Holy Week.
Lisbell wasn’t a particularly devout believer. If it weren’t for
following her mother today, she wouldn’t necessarily attend
Holy Week.
Unlike her, Mrs. Osborne was quite devout, which was
related to her status before she married.
Mrs. Osborne had originally been a nun at a convent in a
foreign country. She was abandoned there as a baby in a
basket, grew up in that compassionate environment, and
naturally walked the path of a religious devotee.
However, she became pregnant by chance.
Despite the religious doctrine that everyone is worthy of
love under God, certain strict rules were to be adhered to in
the life of a devotee. Nuns were required to remain celibate
to serve as vessels for God. Naturally, bearing a child was
considered sinful.
Upon discovering her pregnancy, Mrs. Osborne immediately
left the convent. She moved to a distant rural village and
gave birth to Lisbell, whom she had carried for ten months.
From that day on, Mrs. Osborne devoted herself to caring for
and raising her only daughter.
Many practical barriers made her life difficult. Having relied
on religion all her life, she was naturally ignorant of how to
earn money. But money was necessary. It was indispensable
for raising a child. Whether to fill the baby’s stomach or to
keep her warm in cold, rainy, or snowy weather….
To provide for Lisbell, Mrs. Osborne took on any job she
could find. She didn’t differentiate between what she could
or couldn’t do. She went anywhere that offered payment.
When she couldn’t leave the baby behind because she was
too young, people would click their tongues, calling her
tough.
Despite this, she endured and lovingly cared for Lisbell. She
raised her through harsh and bitter times, shielding her
under a small canopy from the wind and snow.
As Lisbell began to babble and speak, they became
inseparable friends. Mrs. Osborne would smile as if she
owned the world at the child’s simple words and gestures.
Though their world wasn’t warm, it wasn’t cold either. It
offered a small warmth that could thaw frozen hands and
feet.
Some memories were hazy, others clear as day, allowing
Lisbell to understand the hardships her mother had
endured. Learning about her own background, she also
came to know her mother’s original profession.
With that knowledge, an affectionate guilt began to form in
her heart.
Her mother hadn’t disliked being a nun. The soft smile she
wore when talking about her life there was proof. Therefore,
it was entirely because of Lisbell that she had to leave that
comfortable community.
If only I hadn’t existed.
Lisbell had begun to have such thoughts so long ago that
she could no longer remember when.
Ironically, this guilt was mutual. Her mother always felt
sorry for having brought her into a life where she had to
face unnecessary hardships. For instance, enduring
relentless poverty and hardship.
Lisbell couldn’t understand her mother in this regard. Yet, at
the same time, she did understand. The more she thought
about it, the clearer it became. It was as obvious as looking
into a mirror. They shared the same feelings without an
ounce of difference.
In other words, their mutual incomprehension stemmed
from a place of deep affection.
And this affection created a sense of dissonance.
After going through a phase where they shared every detail
of their day, they started keeping things to themselves,
thinking it better not to say certain things out loud. They
became cautious, fearing that even a small misstep could
shatter their delicate relationship like a glass jar.
Their love and care for each other, while well-intentioned,
didn’t always manifest healthily or beneficially.
Excessive consideration can sometimes cause pain, just as
their relationship became a very thin glass wall. It’s possible
to tap on it, but any more than that and it might break.
Questions that could easily be asked between mother and
daughter were internally censored first, and they both
pretended to be unaffected to avoid worrying the other.
It was a consideration that couldn’t simply be blamed on
one person.
This is why they had never talked about her father
Fearing that the presence might hurt her mother, she
avoided it, and it became a kind of taboo word. Her
mother’s love was so abundant that she never really felt any
lack in that regard.
“Hello, Sister Helen.”
It was near the end of the service.
Someone approached and spoke to her mother. Unlike
Lisbell, who was visiting for the first time, her mother
seemed quite familiar since she attended every Sunday.
A woman, who looked somewhat worried and wore a
mantilla like a devout believer, held her mother’s sleeve.
Mrs. Osborne interrupted her and looked at Lisbell standing
beside her.
“Lisbell, it looks like this conversation might take a while.
Could you wait outside?”
“Yes, I’ll do that.”
Lisbell nodded at the approaching woman and exited the
chapel first. Sitting in front of a flower bed with tiny stones,
she watched the bright yellow buttercups planted inside.
Soon, Mrs. Osborne approached.
Lisbell shook her head at her mother’s apology for making
her wait and pointed outside the church.
“Mother, I saw a lovely coffee house in front earlier. How
about stopping by there before heading back to the villa?”
“Shall we?”
The coffee house they went to was quiet, as it was not yet
noon. In the distance, a cheese-colored cat, presumably
owned by the house owner, waved its tail and meowed.
Lisbell took a seat by the window where the sunlight poured
in warmly, with her mother.
“So, how much more time do you need?”
“Pardon?”
“You have something you want to say to me, don’t you?”
Lisbell, startled, chuckled almost in resignation.
“Really, Mother, I can’t win against you. How long have you
known?”
“It’s obvious when you’re lost in thought every time we’re
together. Please understand my situation of pretending not
to notice even though I did.”
Mrs. Osborne smiled and sipped the coffee she had ordered.
Lisbell, feeling embarrassed, straightened her posture.
“I still want to be close to you, Mother.”

“Even after I get married.”
Though she said it with determination, her mother didn’t
seem particularly surprised. In the next moment, the calm
look on her face made Lisbell realize that her mother had
vaguely anticipated this topic.
“I’m very glad you think of me that way.”

“But I clearly told you before. My thoughts haven’t
changed.”
“Mother.”
“Lisbell, I have no intention of becoming a burden in your
future.”
“Why do you think of yourself as a burden?”

“How could you ever be a burden to me….”
Her mother’s warm smile felt like an unbreakable fortress
today. No matter how hard she tried to break it down, it was
a barrier she couldn’t cross. Feeling dejected, she bowed her
head slightly, and a gentle hand rested on hers.
“Leaving here doesn’t mean saying goodbye forever. Just
like now, you can see me whenever you want. We’ll meet
before your wedding too. Even if we live apart, we can still
stay in touch by phone or letters if the situation makes calls
difficult.”
“But….”
“Everything I have built is here. Moving to start a new life
there would be overwhelming and difficult. I worry it might
become a burden for you during that process.”

“So, I want to stay here and be your foundation. You need to
look forward rather than backward. I raised you with the
hope that you would move forward.”
Lisbell bit her lower lip.
Her mother’s resolve was firm, but the underlying affection
was palpable.
How could she insist further?
It was sad to hear her mother describe herself as a ‘burden’
or ‘past,’ but it paradoxically conveyed her true feelings.
Indeed, experience couldn’t be ignored. Her mother had
unknowingly persuaded her. A corner of her heart ached.
“Besides, I can’t give up such a great job like managing the
Marinia villa.”
Patting Lisbell’s hand, her mother made an awkward joke.
Lisbell, whose eyes were slightly red, paused before
deliberately smiling brightly.
Their ordered drinks slowly dwindled as they engaged in
conversation. They talked about Lisbell’s school days, her
teary moments before starting dorm life at university, and
other trivial memories.
Spending such harmonious time together, Lisbell reaffirmed
her belief.
Being her mother’s daughter was incredibly happy.
Though her mother often felt guilty about what she couldn’t
do, Lisbell’s memories were filled with the happiness her
mother provided. Moments of appreciating and enjoying the
happiness her mother brought.
The sun shining at their feet was a brilliant orange.
After a brief rest, they returned to the villa. Lisbell’s eyes
caught on something unusual. Beside the familiar greenishyellow car, there was a strange black sedan.
Who could it be?
Her curiosity was short-lived. Lisbell walked into the villa.
Returning to the guest room, she untied the ribbon at her
neckline and noticed a book on the wooden table. It was one
she borrowed from the study two days ago. She decided to
return it and left the room with the book in her arms.
The corridor leading to the study was long like a maze. As
she walked on the soft carpet, she heard a bang!
A gunshot.
Her instincts reacted before her rational mind. She stood
frozen, her heart pounding.
Bang!
Bang! bang!
The destructive sound that could shatter the peaceful world
continued. Lisbell quietly moved towards an open window.
Another bang rang out as if to shoot her down.
A long shadow cast on the ground.
It wasn’t a false déjà vu.
The man who sent her a folded paper in the past was the
one making these aggressive sounds.
It was Ulrich.
His profile was balanced and solid. His relaxed stance, the
rolled-up sleeves of his shirt revealing muscular arms with
bulging veins, and the black protective gear on his
shoulders were striking.
Bang!
A bullet flew at incredible speed and hit the target.
A distant target was set up. Lisbell wasn’t walking this
corridor for the first time. She had never seen such a target
here before. It seemed like an improvised shooting range.
Even after firing, Ulrich didn’t lower his arm. His
experienced stance showed he was no novice.
His straight back and firmly planted legs were steady. He
resembled a fierce hunter who never missed his prey.
Yet, there was an inexplicable nobility in his actions. The
gun, a symbol of violence, became a luxurious accessory in
his hands. Despite the loud, fierce sounds, he remained
calm and emotionless, creating an air of cold elegance.
But it was only for a moment.
A crease formed on his previously untroubled brow. He
lowered the arm he had been holding up towards the target,
frowning. The hand not holding the gun rose to massage his
shoulder, which was strapped with a protective pad. It
seemed that the recoil had made his muscles sore.
Now she noticed there was another person in the courtyard.
While Ulrich was firing at the target, a man who had been
standing to the side approached him as he stopped
shooting.
He was a stranger.
Though he wore a shirt and trousers, unlike Ulrich, who
looked more relaxed without a tie or vest and with rolled-up
sleeves, this new man wore a tie and cufflinks, giving him a
much more formal and respectful appearance.
The two men moved towards the shaded area of the
courtyard.
A long table stood there, neatly arrayed with guns spaced
evenly apart. The two men exchanged words. To be precise,
Ulrich spoke, and the new man diligently took notes in a
small notebook.
Suddenly, the black sedan near the fountain came to mind.
Perhaps he was from the capital. Judging by his attentive
demeanor, it seemed likely that he was Ulrich’s secretary,
assisting with his business affairs.
“Well, he did seem extremely busy.”
Ulrich’s busy schedule was something she had already
witnessed in the study. The towering stacks of documents
had seemed precarious, as if they might topple over at any
moment.
He handled the piles of paperwork as if such a workload was
nothing unusual, reviewing the documents with the same
impassive expression he had when he hit the bullseye.
“Ah.”
She involuntarily let out a small sound.
Ulrich, who had been talking with the man presumed to be
his secretary, was now looking up at Lisbell. With a formal
yet endearing smile, he waved at her. She didn’t know when
he had noticed her, but there was no surprise in his
demeanor. The secretary had vanished like smoke.
“Lisbell, what are you doing up there?”
“I was heading to the study when I heard gunshots. I was
curious about what was going on.”
“Ah, sorry. It must have been noisy.”
He glanced at the gun in his hand, then at her face, and
raised his arms in a gesture of mock surrender.
Lisbell felt her ribs tighten. It was a sign of tension. She
quickly recalled why she felt this way.
“I’d rather die before I turn thirty.”
Those words had lingered heavily in her mind.
Though he had immediately brushed it off as a joke to
lighten the mood, it was hard to fully accept his
reassurance.
Ulrich, who had undoubtedly reached his current position
through numerous business relationships, was undoubtedly
skilled in dealing with people. His eyes sometimes gleamed
with an unnerving clarity, suggesting he had an innate
ability to read situations.
So when he had downplayed the seriousness of his
statement, she couldn’t help but wonder if there was some
truth behind it.
Regardless of his true intentions, the fact remained that he
had spoken of suicide, a topic that pained her to even think
about, with a casual smile while holding a gun.
What if he suddenly turned the gun on himself and pulled
the trigger without hesitation?
The thought, which had nagged at her, now felt like a sharp
stab in her chest.
While Lisbell was lost in these unspoken thoughts, he
gestured calmly for her to come down. After a moment’s
hesitation, she nodded.
First, she went to the study to put the book back in its place,
then hurried down the stairs. Knowing someone was waiting
for her made her steps on the hallway carpet a bit more
urgent. Though she wasn’t running recklessly, she wasn’t
walking leisurely either when she arrived at the courtyard.
By then, Ulrich had removed the shoulder pad he had been
wearing like an epaulet.
Beneath the shirt, which clung perfectly to his frame, his
muscles moved dynamically. She knew what lay beneath the
fabric; she had seen his bare torso with her own eyes. The
scene of water droplets trickling down his chest and abs was
still vivid in her mind.
“Are you here?”
She nodded, and Ulrich’s hand suddenly reached toward her
face. Startled, she stepped back.
Ulrich’s eyes widened. Then he laughed softly and removed
a leaf stuck to her hair. He waved it playfully in front of her,
signaling that there was no need for her to be so wary.
Feeling embarrassed by her exaggerated reaction, Lisbell
murmured her thanks.
“I heard you went to the city with Mrs. Osborne.”
“Yes, we attended morning prayer together. We just
returned to the villa a short while ago.”
“Ah, church.”
After a brief response, he naturally changed the subject.
“Have you ever shot a gun?”
“No, never.”
It was her first time even seeing one in person.
“Would you like to try?”
“Me?”
Lisbell’s eyes widened.
Ulrich chuckled at her surprised reaction.
“Yes, you.”
“No, I’d rather not.”
“Why not?”
“…”
“Are you scared?”
“Yes.”
“There’s nothing to be afraid of. You saw it earlier, right? I’ve
already tested all of these. There’s nothing defective among
them. One had a bit of a strong recoil, but my secretary
already took it away.”
Despite his reassurances, she still felt uneasy. After all, she
knew these were weapons designed to harm others.
Sensing her hesitation, Ulrich sighed softly.
“You never know.”
The corners of his mouth stretched into a long, snake-like
grin.
“There might come a time when you want to shove a gun in
your husband’s mouth.”
He was clearly skilled in social interactions, but sometimes
his comments were so unpredictable and unsettling that she
couldn’t tell if he was just teasing her. Lisbell looked at
Ulrich, who could make such bizarre and disturbing remarks
as easily as he breathed, unsure whether to laugh or frown.
“Come here.”
Ignoring her reaction, Ulrich pulled her wrist.
“It’s not hard. As long as you hold it correctly and maintain
your stance, nothing will go wrong.”
His deep voice wrapped around her ears, making her think
of the hand that had just removed the leaf from her hair.
Ulrich positioned Lisbell beside him, pressing his body
against hers as he placed a pre-selected gun in her hands.
The cold metal felt strange against her palm.
“See, the trigger guard fits your hand perfectly. It felt a bit
tight on my fingers.”
“Am I holding it correctly?”
“Yes. And your other hand goes here.”
She was startled, not by the unfamiliar object in her hand
but by Ulrich’s natural embrace as he adjusted her stance.
She hadn’t expected such contact. The unfamiliar weight
made her eyes widen. Her heart tightened and then
released, sending blood rushing through her body. The
sudden increase in circulation made her vision blur
momentarily.
“Focus.”
Ulrich’s voice was calm and detached, as if to emphasize
that his touch was purely instructional.
His gaze was similarly detached, fixed intently on the target.
Lisbell was flustered.
It was clear that only she was overly conscious of the
situation.
She took a deep breath, trying to regain her composure.
Ulrich’s fingers brushed her shoulder, lightly squeezing and
then releasing, before slowly trailing down her waist to her
side.
The hand was over the blouse. The large palm moved across
the fabric, yet the warmth that can only be felt with skin-toskin contact seeped through.
Was it because the cloth was too thin, or was it because the
man’s touch was too slow and lingering?
In the midst of this ambiguous sensation, the air grew
sharp. The tension was so high that one wrong breath might
cut through it.
“Your waist.”
Perhaps her posture had slightly shifted due to tension.
Ulrich’s hand, now resting near her pelvis, applied strong
pressure.
Instinctively, she tried to pull away, but her body
straightened, finding its proper posture. This brought them
even closer, almost as if they were hugging if seen from
afar. Closing her eyes tightly from the intense tension, she
heard a low chuckle near her ear.
“It’s shooting practice, Lisbell.”

“You shouldn’t close your eyes.”

“Open them.”
At the quiet command, she lifted her eyelids, revealing thick
eyelashes. In front of her was the sleek muzzle of a gun
aimed at a round target.
“Don’t take your eyes off it.”
His voice, though soft as if it could melt, carried an
undeniable authority. It exuded a suffocating arrogance as if
it were natural for him to have others underfoot.
“Take a deep breath.”
The fear remained. Perhaps that’s why she was compelled
to follow his instructions even more rigorously.
Lisbell took a small breath in.
“Straighten your back.”
She straightened her spine, already stiff from the tension,
even more.
“Keep your legs steady.”
She pressed her feet firmly into the ground as if to brace
herself.
“Now, pull the finger you have on the guard inward.”
She squeezed her finger on the trigger.
Immediately, she felt a tremendous recoil. Her body, cradled
as if in his embrace, couldn’t withstand it and stumbled. Her
shoulder throbbed as if it were being crushed. The loud
gunshot left a slight ringing in her ears.
For a moment, her heightened senses gradually calmed
down, leaving only a stinging numbness in her palm.
“How was it?”
“Haah…”
“Doesn’t it feel refreshing?”
In a way, it did.
For a moment, she felt as if her body was floating in the air.
It felt like her heart had plummeted, similar to the sensation
of every nerve in her body screaming. It wouldn’t be strange
to believe that the bullet had hit her instead. Gradually, the
tension unwound, bringing a sense of relief.
But it wasn’t just refreshing. A tingling aftershock lingered in
her mind and body, reminding her that this was indeed a
lethal weapon.
It was a terrible relief.
“The result is pitiful.”
At his words, she quickly lifted her head.
What? Lisbell wondered. She had definitely aimed and fired,
but there was no new mark on the target. Ulrich glanced
towards something with his eyes. Not the target, but a tree
trunk where a mark had appeared.
Realizing she had damaged an innocent tree, Lisbell was
speechless. Ulrich took the gun from her hands, smiling.
“To think you didn’t even hit the target…”
“Well, it’s my first time. Unless someone has an exceptional
sense, that’s how it usually goes.”
“Did you… go through the same?”
“Hm.”
He laughed awkwardly.
“I managed to nick the edge of the target.”
“…You must have had quite a natural talent.”
Ulrich, checking the magazine, smiled brightly. It was a
compliment she accepted with a bow. Despite not expecting
much, the dismal result left Lisbell alternating glances
between the target and the tree, before focusing on the
target’s center.
“Still, you must have practiced a lot.”
“Hm?”
“All your shots earlier hit the center.”
“Oh, well. I practiced occasionally when I had the time.
Besides, the main house isn’t exactly a place where I can
practice comfortably.”
“Why not?”
It seemed there should be no difficulty in setting up a
makeshift target in the courtyard like now. Puzzled, Lisbell
asked, and Ulrich smiled wryly as if recalling something.
“My mother has a fit when it comes to fguns.”
Bang!
As he finished speaking, he quickly raised the gun in his
hand, took aim, and fired. A faint haze rose in the air. The
makeshift target among the thick branches trembled.
Again, the center.
There was no missing.
“One time, I showed her this, and she nearly fainted,
clutching her forehead. Her acting is so convincing that I’m
still not sure if it was real or not. As a result, my prized gun
was confiscated that day. It was a specially commissioned
piece with gold plating on the slide, one of the few in the
world.”
Lisbell blinked slowly.
It seemed like an exaggerated complaint, but given his
evident frustration, it made her think his mother might have
overreacted. Then again, she knew nothing about his
circumstances and could have just brushed it off as some
trivial noble matter.
But maybe… his mother knew something too?
Consciousness accumulates like sediment. His desire to die
didn’t come overnight. It might have emerged gradually,
adding weight over time until it could be discussed so
casually now.
Parents are often more sensitive about their children. They
tend to notice subtle hints that others might miss.
Perhaps that’s why his mother was so terrified and took
away the gun.
“Still, it seems you’re not entirely without talent. My college
friend couldn’t even hit the makeshift target. He was all
bluster and ended up firing into the ground. Those are the
kinds of people who shouldn’t talk about having a ‘sense’.”
“Haha…”
“How about it, Lisbell?”
“Yes?”
“Would you like to learn to shoot from me while you’re
here?”
He handed her the gun again. Feeling its weight in her
hands, Lisbell quickly shook her head.
“No, no, it’s fine. I don’t think it suits me. Honestly… I’m still
scared. My heart feels like it’s going to burst. It’s even worse
now that I’ve tried it. The fear of accidentally hurting
someone…”
“You’re quite timid.”
“It’s a gun. Any woman would feel the same. Besides, I’m
not staying here long enough… I’ll be returning to Misley
soon.”
Ulrich, who had been brushing his hair in the breeze,
paused.
“Lisbell, are you leaving soon?”
“Yes, I think so.”
Returning to the villa with her mother today, Lisbell decided
it was time to return to Misley. Her resolve, which was
almost like a mission, was bent by her mother’s gentle
persuasion, and she was increasingly worried about
Theodore, who was waiting for her alone in Misley.
“This vacation had a purpose. I wanted to persuade my
mother to move with me after my marriage. But… she’s
quite fond of this place. She firmly stated she wouldn’t
leave, so I can’t insist anymore.”
“I see.”
“Yes. Oh, by the way…”
“Hm?”
“Do you know of any good dress shops in town?”
During the morning service, she noticed her mother’s
sleeves were frayed. The fabric had been mended multiple
times, with the stitches clearly visible.
Having not lived a life of abundance, Mrs. Osborne disliked
spending money unnecessarily. She always taught Lisbell to
use it wisely and only when necessary.
And now, Lisbell believed that buying her mother a new
dress was precisely that necessary expenditure.
“A dress shop?”
“Yes, I’d like to buy my mother a dress before I leave….”
“Ah.”
He nodded as if he understood.
“A dress shop in town…”
He fell silent, his gaze distant. Soon, a charming smile
appeared on his face.
“Shall I go with you?”
“Pardon?”
“Let’s go together.”

“I’ll join you.”
A familiar smile approached her.
She had felt it before, but he often behaved in this friendly,
informal manner. He seemed well aware that his outward
appearance was a powerful weapon, and he didn’t hesitate
to make direct eye contact and draw close to people.
Even now, as he made this mysterious suggestion, it was
the same.
“Aren’t you too busy to be so concerned about me?”
Surprised, she asked belatedly, and Ulrich shrugged his
shoulders.
“Taking a day off won’t ruin my business.”

“Well.”

“Hm?”
Even a mute puppy wouldn’t beg like this.
Lisbell stared at Ulrich awkwardly.
She wanted to refuse, feeling it would be a bother in many
ways, but something held her back.
Something that still lingered in her mind.
A disturbing comment she had heard, something that had
stuck with her ever since.
It was a chilling remark that sounded like it came from
someone suffering from long-term depression….
Although she was not a medical expert and knew nothing
about clinical psychology, she understood that people with
such symptoms required careful handling. It was especially
bad to confine oneself to a limited space and reduce one’s
range of activity….
Unfortunately, the place where she heard talk of suicide was
a very secluded study. The scratchy sound of the fountain
pen she heard that day still echoed in her ears.

Ulrich coldly smiled inwardly as he watched the woman in
front of him deep in thought. He could easily guess what she
was thinking.
When he watched her standing in the hallway through the
glass earlier, she looked as worried as if watching a child
near water. And it had been like that for a while.
She had openly shown anxiety about suicide since the day
she overheard him talk about it.
Or perhaps not openly.
She thought she was hiding it well, but it was easy for Ulrich
to see through.
Maybe it was the inherent angelic syndrome common
among those aspiring to be teachers, or perhaps it was her
naturally caring nature. Whatever the reason, she seemed
concerned about him.
She didn’t seem to believe his casual attempts to pass it off
as a joke.
Which was true, in a way.
Talking about leaving the world before turning thirty had
been a frequent refrain since Ulrich graduated from
university.
Everyone is born ignorant.
Like a pristine, untouched snowfield. Like a blank page
without a single doodle.
A small dot marks the surface.
That is the primordial desire.
A tiny dot-like desire, curiosity, germinates within. Achieving
those desires one by one, learning about success and
failure, and understanding the accompanying pleasures and
displeasures.
Life is a long journey of fulfilling these conflicting desires.
The problem lies in that process.
As common desires are fulfilled one by one, they inevitably
lose their potency. The pleasure of the first experience fades
through repetition and learning. And the second and third
pleasures gradually lose their strength.
In the end, life filled with repetitive, uninteresting acts
reaches a point of transcendence. Nothing can excite or
interest anymore….
Sadly, this described Ulrich perfectly.
Having indulged in all sorts of stimuli since childhood, he
felt his post-university life had been exactly that. The world
had not lost its flavor suddenly; rather, his mind had gone
dull. Otherwise, how could everything in life seem so
monotonous, boring, and dry?
The comment about having no attachment to such a tedious
life was more than just a reaction; it was a habitual
utterance now, almost as natural as breathing.
Even in his family’s mansion, people used to panic
whenever he mentioned it. Initially, it provided a novel
amusement, but even that thrill faded, and now it was
dismissed as mere nonsense.
His mother, who once wept at such words, now merely
clicked her tongue, saying it was another of his bad spells,
while Gwen Altahart mockingly suggested he should write a
will to transfer hotel and department store shares to his
elder brother before kicking the bucket.
Determined to spite him, Ulrich resolved that if he were to
leave a will, it would state that he would sell all his shares
and donate everything to charity.
Anyway… setting aside his crazy family circumstances.
It had been a long time since anyone had shown such frail,
almost touchable concern for him.
It was vibrant.
A living reaction.
But the more he thought about it, the more he laughed.
The problem was the person showing the concern.
She was just a commoner. A trivial girl who should worry
about her own affairs rather than him.
Every time he saw himself reflected in her pure, innocent
violet eyes, the emotion called ‘pity’ surfaced
simultaneously.
How audacious and presumptuous. It was like a small mouse
licking a thorn stuck in a beast’s paw. The thought alone
made him laugh.
Yet, there was a refreshing novelty in her attitude.
Not just her behavior, but his own impulse to act childishly
in response to her pity was equally novel.
He wanted to test how much she could accept him. If he
said he wanted to die and asked for a blowjob, would she
hesitate like now and then comply?
The impulses came sporadically, like his damaged frontal
lobe twitching, mixed with mischievous and devilish urges.
“If you’re willing to do that….”
Accepting so readily, despite finding it uncomfortable to
even breathe in the same space, was just presumptuous
pity.
Thinking it was a rare opportunity to receive a commoner’s
pity, Ulrich let a bright smile touch his lips.
“Today’s timing is a bit awkward. It might take some time at
the tailor’s, so how about tomorrow?”
Lisbell nodded vigorously. It seemed like a response to his
smile.
The voice of the past, dreaming of becoming a teacher,
echoed.
Ulrich wrinkled his eyes and smiled as if scowling.

The center of Marnia’s city, Boilek Street.
A greenish-yellow car approached smoothly. It was a unique
color, flashy enough to catch the eye without being
overwhelming. Comfortable luxury.
A man stepped out of the driver’s seat.
He wore a light beige vest over a white shirt, with no sign of
a constraining tie. His casual, unfussy attire perfectly
matched the car’s comfortable luxury.
He walked around the bonnet and opened the passenger
door.
A woman hesitated as she stepped out.
Her outfit didn’t look particularly good, with a rather modest
underblouse and a demure goreskirt. Thin silk stockings and
brown flats showed no sense of aesthetic harmony, a
haphazard combination.
But her face was different. With finely chiseled features on a
slender face, her appearance was anything but ordinary.
Despite having the same eyes, nose, and mouth as anyone
else, her beauty was undeniable.
Most striking were her violet irises, capturing and focusing
attention.
Her outfit was plain, but if she dressed according to current
fashion trends, she could easily attract any man’s interest.
Ding-a-ling.
A clear bell rang through the tailor shop like a bird’s song.
Lisbell, following behind Ulrich, hesitantly stepped into the
upscale tailor shop.
“Excuse me, madam.”
Even before they entered, the madam had been watching
the car stop in front of her shop. “Oh my,” she exclaimed,
covering her lips. She seemed excited, as if seeing someone
rarely encountered here.
“We have a reservation under the name Victor Loisden.”
The madam’s anticipation visibly faded. Lisbell easily read
her change in mood. It seemed she had recognized Ulrich
from his newspaper photos, given her keen eye due to her
profession.
While she recognized him correctly, Ulrich’s nonchalant
demeanor, confidently using his secretary’s name, was
convincing enough to fool anyone, even Lisbell.
“Welcome. I’ve been expecting you.”
The madam soon regained her business composure, smiling
politely and leading them inside. People who earn money
often have a keen sense for potential profit, and the madam
of the tailor shop was no exception. After quickly assessing
the obvious differences in attire between the two, she
naturally gravitated towards Ulrich.
Of course, it wasn’t just about money.
Her faint blush indicated a clear romantic interest. Ulrich
was a man who naturally attracted such feelings.
“The customer here today is this lady.”
With practiced ease, Ulrich displayed his social skills, pulling
Lisbell’s wrist and subtly hiding behind her, making her feel
less out of place in the tailor shop.
“I’ll sit on the sofa, so take your time looking around,
Lisbell.”
“Oh, okay.”
The madam’s gaze quietly shifted between the two, then
she smiled meaningfully and led Lisbell further inside.
Meanwhile, Ulrich headed to a sofa by the window. Crossing
his legs on the plush velvet sofa, he picked up a catalog
prepared for waiting customers. The looks displayed,
claimed to be the latest trends here, had mostly already
swept through the capital.
Daring and glamorous trends always originated in the
capital’s social circles. Thus, a tailor shop in this dull, small
town confidently presented slightly outdated fashions as
trends. Ulrich leisurely flipped through the catalog,
reminiscing about the nostalgic relics.
“If it’s too difficult, why not ask the gentleman?”
The madam, bustling about earlier, now subtly suggested.
Knowing there was only one gentleman here, Lisbell
naturally turned her head.
As expected, both women’s eyes were on him.
“Is there a problem?”
“The lady is having trouble deciding.”
Hmm. Ulrich rested his chin on his hand.
Indeed, Lisbell looked overwhelmed, given too much
information at once. She was confused by the various
fabrics and different sleeve samples in her hands.
“You said you’re here to buy a gift for Mrs. Osborne?”
“Yes, that’s right.”
“How about trying it on yourself, Lisbell?”
“Me?”
“You two are about the same size.”
Before Lisbell could react, the madam clapped her hands,
agreeing it was a good idea, and quickly brought out sample
outfits.
Pushed to the back of the shop, Lisbell tried on the outfits
one by one and stood before Ulrich. She felt a vague sense
of shame, as if she wanted his approval. His gaze was more
serious than when reviewing business documents.
“What do you think?”
After a few fittings, the madam turned to the sofa.
In the sunlight, Ulrich, more radiant than the light, finally
spoke.
“The buttons are generally too many.”

“I prefer something easy to take off.”
At that moment, his usual elegance and dignity were
useless. It was such a crude comment that even the
madam, eager to sell her goods, was speechless.
“Maybe underwear would be better, madam.”

“It was a joke, but no one’s laughing.”
“The second one was the best.”
“Oh, my. I thought so too! It seems the gentleman and I
have similar tastes.”
The madam, recovering slightly, added a flattering remark.
Lisbell recalled the second outfit he mentioned.
It was a classic puff blouse with a high neckline and slightly
voluminous sleeves. It felt stifling just wearing it briefly, but
it suited her mother, who lived in a strict convent before
having her. His advice was appropriate, and since he was
her mother’s employer, anything he liked would surely be
fine.
“Shall I put the payment on my tab?”
Ulrich asked, seemingly ready to leave.
“No! I’ll pay for it.”
“Hmm? It’s fine.”
She remembered his offer to cover all expenses in Marnia.
However, she didn’t expect him to cover such individual
expenses.
She admired him anew. Though she hadn’t seen the bill, the
high-end tailor shop would be costly. Yet, for him, it was a
small sum he could easily cover. His confidence and ease
were second nature, showcasing the true power of Altahart.
“It’s a gift for my mother, so I should pay.”
Gratitude was gratitude, but fairness was fairness.
Ulrich didn’t argue further, letting her have her way.
“Alright then. Madam, we’ll take the second one. Lisbell, I’ll
wait outside.”
The madam, hoping he would visit again, bid him farewell.
Ulrich responded with a courteous smile and exited the
shop.
Lisbell paused as she was about to change back.
“…Excuse me.”
“Yes?”
“Can I buy this too?”
“Which one?”
“This…tie.”
“Of course. We’ve selected colors and patterns that are
currently in vogue.”
In an era where bespoke items were a luxury, factory-made
products like ties became popular.
A tie was fitting for this era. Unlike clothes, it didn’t require
size adjustments.
Since he’s been so considerate…
It seemed nice to give Ulrich a gift too, not just for his
kindness over the past few days but also as a token for
taking good care of her mother in the future.
She recalled the light beige vest he wore today.
The empty spot where a tie should be made it easy to
imagine. Considering the various light tones, Lisbell picked a
tie.
It was a deep, dark black, like the night.
Clack.
Putting down the receiver, Lisbell lowered her shoulders,
which had been tense with excitement. The voice of her
fiancé, who she had just finished speaking with, lingered
deep inside her.
She turned to look beside her, gently touching her earlobe.
While exchanging greetings with Theodore over the phone,
the sun had already set. The intense dusk that had crept
over the ground vanished, giving way to the quietly
spreading evening sky.
It had always been like this, a fairy-tale place. It was like a
piece of art framed by the window.
Today was the last day for enjoying this beautiful scenery.
When she mentioned she would return by train tomorrow
morning, Theodore was as purely happy as a child.
Three days had passed since she went to town with Ulrich.
And yesterday, Lisbell visited the tailor shop alone to pick
up the blouse she had ordered for her mother and the tie
she had bought separately.
Even though she had received an estimate earlier, when the
time came to actually pay, she felt suffocated. The endless
wealth of the man who generously offered to charge
everything to him was truly astonishing.
She gave the blouse to her mother as soon as she returned.
Her mother, though wondering why she had bothered, was
clearly pleased.
After a late lunch with her mother, they walked along the
meadow path outside the villa, discussing the types of
flowers. Lisbell had just finished a phone call with Theodore
upon returning.
The world was quiet under the darkening sky. In a rural
small town, the day was practically over as the sun set.
Returning to the room where she had stayed for the past
week, Lisbell took out a box she had stored under the bed.
Inside the box, with a calm navy blue background featuring
the tailor shop’s name, was a simpler tie.
There had been many opportunities to give it, but now she
was feeling nervous and kept avoiding it. She had chosen it
without much thought, but now that she had it, all sorts of
worries came to mind.
Would he like it?
Is the color too plain?
What about the design? The length?
Is it too plain without any decorations?
Was the price appropriate?
While she had been optimistic at the time of purchase, now
she was only seeing flaws.
More than anything, remembering Ulrich’s usual attire made
her hesitate. Even Lisbell, who wasn’t well-versed in fashion,
could tell his clothes were of high quality. Though he often
wore them casually, the finishing touches, the detailing,
even a single button, were all meticulously crafted. The
meticulousness of the clothing translated into its high cost.
His clothes were undoubtedly top-notch.
So she worried.
What if it doesn’t meet his standards? What if he thinks it’s
too low quality?
Given Ulrich’s personality, he wouldn’t show any
dissatisfaction, but still….
She knew that the essence of a gift was the thought behind
it rather than the object itself, but that only worked with
someone who had ordinary circumstances. She couldn’t
shake the worry that she might be burdening someone who
already had everything.
But, today was the last day she would see him.
If they had to face each other constantly, the gift might
become an awkward reminder for both of them, but she was
leaving Marnia tomorrow. It was pointless to worry about
how Ulrich would handle the gift. Even if he threw it away
immediately, she wouldn’t know, so it wouldn’t matter
much.
Or even if she did find out…
Lisbell was not someone important enough for Ulrich to care
about.
Alright, just give it to him since it’s bought.
Holding the gift box, Lisbell left her room. Recalling that he
was in the study earlier, she headed in that direction but
found him outside the window. It was an open pavilion near
the meticulously maintained garden and the ever-flowing
silver fountain. His silhouette was faintly visible against the
pavilion’s railing and steps.
Lisbell quickly changed direction and descended the stairs.
Outside, the sound of branches rustling in the wind could be
heard. The fairy-tale-like place had a distinct atmosphere
between day and night.
Sensing he was enjoying some solitary thought, she
instinctively quieted her steps. However, she couldn’t
completely muffle the sound of her footsteps, so Ulrich
noticed her as she approached the pavilion.
His eyes widened slightly in surprise at seeing her in an
unexpected place, then returned to their usual relaxed
shape. His lips curved into a subtle smile.
“Lisbell.”
He called her softly, chuckling lightly.
Was it because it was night? He seemed unusually relaxed.
If he were a ribbon, he usually maintained a tied form, but
now he seemed almost completely untied.
Lisbell soon noticed the glass in his hand.
“What brings you here?”
He asked, tilting his glass back and forth.
Lisbell scratched her cheek.
“Well, I wanted to give you something.”
“To me?”
Ulrich leaned back slightly, gesturing to the seat beside him
with his eyes.
“Why don’t you come up here instead of standing there?”
His manner of offering a spot beside him was without
hesitation. Then again, he always behaved this way,
unbothered by social cues. Even if she tried to avoid him,
his blatant persistence would always place them in the
same space.
Anyway, since she intended to give the gift, Lisbell climbed
the stairs with a calm heart.
“Would you like a drink?”
“Is it alcohol?”
“Yeah.”
He casually used informal speech. Though he occasionally
used a comfortable tone, he had never spoken informally
before. Clearly, he was a bit tipsy.
“No, thank you. I’m not good with alcohol.”
“Have you tried it before?”
“Yes.”
Oh, he softly exclaimed.
“Must be a bad memory.”
“Um, yes. I felt very sick the next day.”
“That happens when you drink too much.”
He chuckled and didn’t press her further, pouring another
glass for himself. Lisbell glanced at the outdoor table in the
pavilion. Besides the glass he was holding, there were spare
glasses, a bucket of fresh ice, and….
“What’s this?”
She asked, more out of concern than curiosity. Scattered
around his glass were a few pills. Seeing what Lisbell was
staring at, Ulrich pressed the pills with his fingertip.
“Drugs.”

“I’m kidding.”

“Lisbell, you faint if you hear two jokes. You always get so
serious. Is it rude if I say you’re the perfect type to tease?”
How could she not be serious when a man who had once
talked about suicide was seemingly playing with drugs?
Lisbell stared at him with a complicated expression, knowing
he was someone who made light of everything. He shrugged
his shoulders, still laughing.
“It’s sleeping pills.”
“Do you have insomnia?”
“A bit. Probably because my schedule gets mixed up a lot.”
Though she knew the nature of the pills, it didn’t bring much
relief. Even without medical knowledge, Lisbell understood
that combining such pills with alcohol was dangerous. It was
common sense. And surely, Ulrich knew this too. Yet, he was
doing it anyway, knowingly engaging in such reckless
behavior.
It was contradictory. His light-hearted jokes clashed with the
precarious undertone in his actions.
“Then wouldn’t a warm tea be better than alcohol?”
She suggested cautiously.
She was careful, thinking this might also trigger some deep
part of him.
Ulrich remained silent. Without immediately responding, he
continued pressing the pills with his fingertip. His eyes fixed
on Lisbell’s face as if hooking onto her expression.
Soon, he gave a subtle smile.
“Lisbell, did you say you wanted to be a teacher?”
“Yes? Yes.”
“Hmm.”
He furrowed his brows slightly, as if considering something
difficult, then flicked the pills off the table.
“It doesn’t suit you.”
“Pardon?”
“Being a teacher doesn’t suit you, Lisbell.”
Lisbell was taken aback.
No matter how straightforward and unfiltered one’s nature
might be, was it really acceptable to blurt out every thought
that comes to mind directly to someone’s face?
However, Ulrich was so confident and composed that it was
impossible to call out his rudeness. Even his arrogance
seemed to be part of his inherent power. Judging by the
atmosphere, she felt as if she should actually be grateful for
receiving such advice.
“…Why?”
Fundamentally, she was curious.
While he often said things that made no sense, this didn’t
seem like one of those times. Sometimes, his words and
actions seemed so calculated that it was as if he had
foreseen the ripples they would cause. It made her wonder
if he was a masterful actor.
So, she couldn’t dismiss his comment as mere nonsense.
In all honesty, she was curious why he thought that way.
Becoming a teacher had been her long-held dream. Many of
her envisioned futures revolved around it. Thus, hearing
that she wasn’t suited for it was quite a shock.
“Why is that?”
Ulrich simply added another enigmatic question and
chuckled softly, sipping his drink. She had a feeling getting
a clear answer would not be easy.
“More importantly, what did you bring me?”
He skillfully changed the subject.
Though she wanted to know the reason, it felt too difficult,
so Lisbell gave up and picked up the box she had set beside
her.
Ulrich raised his eyebrows, his expression momentarily
brightening with curiosity.
“I bought it at the tailor shop we visited last time. I wanted
to give it to you as a gift.”
“For me?”
“Yes. I’ve been indebted to you for a few days. Thanks to
you, I was able to spend a comfortable time with my mother
after a long while.”
“Can I open it?”
“Of course.”
She swallowed nervously.
Her heart beat a little faster. The lingering anxiety and the
anticipation that came with giving a gift coursed through
her body.
Ulrich’s long, slender fingers untied the ribbon around the
box. He lifted the lid, revealing a neatly folded tie in the
center of the box.
“A tie?”
“Yes. I didn’t know your taste, so I bought the most classic
one.”

“You might already have something similar… If you don’t
like it, you can give it to someone else or not wear it often. If
you really, really don’t like it, you can just throw it away…
Since it’s a gift I gave on a whim….”
The longer Ulrich stared at the box, the more Lisbell
rambled on.
Eventually, Ulrich moved.
He unfurled the neatly rolled tie and draped it around his
neck. Then, he adeptly tied it beneath his open shirt collar.
Just moments ago, he had seemed lazy and indulgent, but
with just a tie, he appeared much more tidy and neat. Yet,
the sensual vibe he exuded was undiminished.
“How does it look?”

“Is it pretty?”
It was a childish question, but she couldn’t argue with it.
It suited him much better than she had anticipated.
Though she didn’t know why he hadn’t worn a tie before, it
almost made her resentful for a moment, it suited him that
well. Given his perpetually languid appearance, she thought
a relaxed look would suit him best, but this look had its own
charm. Whether dressed up or down, he had an irresistible
allure.
“Is it bad?”
When Lisbell remained silent, Ulrich lowered his head as if
to inspect himself.
“No! It looks very good on you.”

“So much so that I can’t stop looking.”
Her worries melted away. She was glad she chose the most
basic one. With his naturally good looks, even something
unusual would have suited him, but the simple colors and
design transformed into something special and elegant
because of him.
Seeing her waving her hands as if worried about a
misunderstanding, Ulrich smiled. He then grabbed the
longer part of the tie and kissed it. His seductive action
made Lisbell momentarily hold her breath.
“Thank you, I’ll cherish it.”
Ah, she finally found the perfect word to describe him.
Seductive. Yes, that was exactly it.
Until now, the literary meaning of the word hadn’t quite
made sense, but now she understood its origin firsthand.
She didn’t need to look far. The strange warmth spreading
through her ears proved it.
“Lisbell, are you cold?”
He gestured with his eyes towards her light pink blouse,
suitable for the warm afternoon but not the cool evening
breeze.
Indeed, it was a bit chilly outside as the evening wind blew.
Ulrich’s gray-blue eyes traced the inside of her blouse’s
collar, unbuttoned for comfort, almost revealing her
cleavage.
“Your skin is very white.”

“Like a snowflake.”
He spoke again, this time more softly. It was hard to tell if he
was talking to himself or to her. She couldn’t respond,
feeling a peculiar sensation. Suddenly, something warm
touched the back of her neck. Realizing it was Ulrich’s
finger, Lisbell flinched.
Watching her reaction, Ulrich pulled the tie off and wrapped
it around her neck instead.
She was too flustered to move.
Sssk, sssk.
The sound of fabric brushing against fabric filled the close
distance.
Lisbell swallowed reflexively.
She didn’t know why he was doing this or why she couldn’t
move, but she felt she shouldn’t. Her palms sweated from
the inexplicable tension.
In the stillness, their eyes met repeatedly, each time
sending a shiver down her spine.
And then, she thought of Theodore.
Her fiancé, soon to be her husband, her lifelong companion.
No matter how she described him, he was a constant source
of comfort.
But now, it wasn’t the familiar, comforting feeling. It was as
if her chest was hollowing out. A discomfort impossible to
describe with words she had acquired throughout her life…


Their eyes met again.
In Ulrich’s light-colored irises, a fierce spark beyond that hue
flickered. Dangerous whirlpools stirred in the blue waves.
It was a moment.
Ulrich grabbed the tie around her neck and pulled her
towards him.

Lisbell instinctively raised her hand to block his lips.
It was close.
Had she hesitated a moment longer…
Her heart pounded erratically.
Her eyes trembled as she tried to calm her racing heart. His
lips, blocked by her hand, continued to gaze at her intently.
She felt as if she might be devoured. One moment of
carelessness and she would be swallowed whole.
Her throat tightened painfully.
Denying it was useless. The angle of Ulrich’s face as if about
to kiss, her own hand blocking his lips, and their actions to
prevent and cause danger were undeniably the same.
They both felt it.
The tie squeezing her neck hurt and burned. But she
couldn’t focus on that. Her heart pounded loudly. The fierce
vibrations shook her entire body. It was hard to collect her
thoughts. Knowing she had to, the more she tried, the
dizzier she became.
It was bad.
The more she thought about what almost happened, the
clearer Theodore’s image became, and the harder it was to
describe her feelings.
Only a beat later could she fully define it.
Guilt.
This was unmistakably guilt.
Thus, Lisbell firmly defined one of his characteristics. He
was a man with a rather impulsive side. Otherwise, nothing
he was about to do made any sense.
In the distance, the moon sparkled. Its clear and transparent
light was as vivid as Theodore’s eyes watching her.
Her heart, which she had barely managed to calm,
plummeted to the ground.
This cannot happen.
Something felt dangerous. She couldn’t maintain this close
distance any longer.
She had to put distance between them.
She had to get away from him immediately.
From him…
“It seems you’ve had too much to drink.”
She had to push him away.
Lisbell hurriedly shifted her hips backward, as if to negate
what had just happened.
The distance, close enough to feel each other’s breath,
widened, and the necktie loosely held in Ulrich’s hand
slipped down.
Lisbell brushed her hair back. She was so flustered that it
felt as if someone had grabbed her head and shaken it.
The most incomprehensible thing was Ulrich’s behavior. He
knew she had a fiancé. With those delicate lips, he had
congratulated her on her engagement the first day they
met. He had even asked when the wedding was and
mentioned she would be a bride by late summer, offering
something akin to a blessing.
Despite that, why on earth…?
Doubts poured in, but Lisbell did not delve deeply into any
of them. The thought that this must not happen remained
strong.
Lisbell removed the tie loosely draped around her neck and
placed it in a box. Then she quickly stood up.
“I’ll be going now.”
“…”
“The night breeze is chilly, so don’t stay outside too long.”
Without checking if her words were appropriate for the
situation, she hurried out of the pavilion.
Perhaps she was still shocked, as the wind on her face felt
hot. The man’s eyes she had faced up close remained
disturbingly vivid. Trying to shake it off, she bit her lower lip
hard until it bled. But even that pain did not wake her dulled
senses.
Back in her room, Lisbell tossed and turned, unable to sleep
for a long time. The late night eventually gave way to dawn,
and then to daylight.
It was a night that felt like being bewitched by something
unknown. There was no other reason for her to be so
restless. Her inexplicably disturbed mind tormented her
inside and out.
Yes, it was truly a tormenting sensation.
Since she couldn’t sleep anyway, Lisbell got up early and
hastily prepared to leave. Her mother, who started work at
seven o’clock sharp, came to her room to see her off. Her
mother looked surprised to see her daughter already up and
ready.
Holding her luggage, Lisbell followed her mother out of the
villa. Her gaze, which had become accustomed to the
garden in just two weeks, stopped at one spot. It was the
outdoor swimming pool, emptied for cleaning. She recalled
the image of transparent water droplets splashing.
“Lisbell?”
“Yes, let’s go.”
She snapped back to reality and hurried her steps. At the
gate, barely open enough for a person to pass, she briefly
hugged her mother.
“Call me as soon as you’re ready. I’ll come to Misley.”
Her mother coughed briefly.
Worried, Lisbell adjusted her mother’s shawl, wrapped
hastily due to the early hour.
“Yes, I will. But mother, are you okay?”
“Yes, it seems I caught a light cold due to the change of
seasons.”
“Don’t neglect it just because it’s light. Make sure to take
medicine, okay?”
“I will. You might miss your train. Go on.”
“I’ll call when I arrive.”
“Okay.”
After hugging her mother again, Lisbell glanced at the
garden. The pavilion’s aesthetic curves caught her eye,
making her flinch as if burned. Her mother, noticing
something strange, stepped back.
“I’ll be going now.”
Before her mother could ask anything, Lisbell quickly turned
and left, feeling like a fugitive rather than someone ending a
vacation. The lingering situation stuck in her mind like a
persistent stain.
The confusion of the night weighed heavily on her.

Having seen her daughter off safely, Mrs. Osborne began
her usual day.
Handling the tasks scheduled from seven in the morning
without delay, she went back to the gate to receive the mail
from the delivery boy.
Crossing the garden, she checked her pocket watch,
noticing there was still some time before noon.
Before heading to the master’s bedroom, Mrs. Osborne
stopped by the guest room where her daughter had stayed.
“Oh my.”
Knowing her daughter well, she expected the room to be
impeccably clean. Contrary to her expectations, the guest
room was still somewhat untidy, suggesting a hurried
departure.
With a small sigh, Mrs. Osborne took the opportunity to tidy
up the guest room.
She straightened the wrinkled bedspread, opened the halfclosed window to air the room, and folded the towels in the
bathroom. Turning around, she noticed a light pink blouse
hanging on a golden hanger.
“How distracted must she have been?”
What could have made her rush so?
Pondering the situation, she took the blouse and draped it
over her arm.
After tidying up, it was nearly noon. She left the room and
walked down the corridor to the master’s bedroom.
A sudden fit of coughing bent Mrs. Osborne’s back like an
old woman’s. The persistent cough painfully rattled her
lungs and throat.
Leaning against the window sill, she noticed blood in her
spit. The metallic taste spread under her nose. Her head felt
dizzy. She stood still, leaning against the window.
At least her daughter hadn’t seen this.
Whenever Lisbell asked if she was unwell, her heart sank
but she managed to pull herself together.
Not yet.
If Lisbell found out, she would feel compelled to take care of
her.
“I still want to be close to you, Mother.”
Her daughter, who couldn’t imagine her having any health
issues, already made such endearing proposals. If she knew
about her condition, she would insist even more on taking
care of her. 
Lisbell had always been that way.
She would pick pretty flowers from the hill to show her
mother, got good grades without burdening the family
financially by not mentioning college, and during college,
she always called on the same day, at the same time, to
check in and share updates.
What the monastery deemed a sinful existence was a
source of pride for Mrs. Osborne. She too wished to spend
her remaining years with her daughter but didn’t want to be
a burden.
Her daughter had grown up wonderfully despite her
inadequacies as a mother. She didn’t want to be a burden
any longer. Discovering the warning signs of her health
issues was fortunate.
Her dizziness cleared a bit. Mrs. Osborne straightened up,
realizing she had spent more time than expected, and
hurried her steps.
Seeing that the church bell hadn’t rung yet, it seemed it
wasn’t noon. The master’s bedroom would still be as quiet
as a night with a crescent moon.
With this thought, she opened the door.
“….”
Unexpectedly, the master was already awake.
Leaning against the window with a cigarette, he gazed
outside. The church bell still hadn’t rung.
The master had risen before the church bell rang
“You’re up early.”
Mrs. Osborne left a brief indication of her presence for her
master, who seemed lost in thought and didn’t even glance
in her direction. She headed towards the desk, placed the
mail she had brought with her on one side, and picked up a
paper knife.
Ssssh, ssssh.
The sharp edge of the knife made a slicing sound as it cut
through the paper.
Even after completing her task, the master continued to
stare out the window. Only now did she become curious
about what he was looking at so intently.
Could there be a problem outside?
Mrs. Osborne followed his gaze with her own.
Despite this, her curiosity remained unsatisfied. All she
could see in the direction he was staring was the pavilion in
the garden. The man was intently observing this ordinary
structure, as if expecting to find something or someone
unusual there.
“Madam.”
“Yes, master.”
“Has Lisbell woken up?”
He asked soon after.
“Yes, she left the villa early this morning.”
Ulrich finally turned around.
“She’s already gone?”
“Yes. I heard she said her farewells to you yesterday.”
“Farewells….”
He laughed.
For some reason, the face he showed her was chilling.
“Yes, she’s gone….”
He stubbed out the cigarette he hadn’t even properly
smoked in the ashtray. His hand brushed his platinum blond
hair. At that moment, the distant sound of church bells
began to ring.
“What would you like for breakfast?”
“I’m not really hungry. Just some coffee, perhaps….”
As Ulrich walked to the desk, he glanced at Mrs. Osborne.
Today, his gaze felt particularly warm as it passed over her
face and moved to her wrist.
Then he suddenly stopped.
“…That.”
“Pardon?”
Mrs. Osborne grew tense at her master’s sudden reaction.
He was pointing at the blouse draped over her arm.
“Oh, I was just tidying up the guest room where my
daughter stayed. She seemed to have forgotten it in the
bathroom in her haste to get ready this morning, so I
brought it with me.”
Expecting this explanation to suffice, she noticed his gaze
still lingering. It was as if he were trying to dissect the
pavilion in the garden earlier.
“Master?”
“Leave that here.”
“Pardon?”
Ulrich tapped the desk.
Mrs. Osborne hesitated, unsure of how to respond. She
glanced between the blouse on her arm and her master’s
face.
Meanwhile, Ulrich was examining the stack of mail. He was
a man who, despite his capricious nature, always followed
through on his decisions. His current demeanor made it
clear that his earlier request was sincere.
…This?
Why?
Although curious, questioning him would be out of place.
Her duty was to follow his instructions without complaint.
Mrs. Osborne placed the blouse on the desk.
“I’ll bring you some coffee and a light brunch. Coffee on an
empty stomach can be unsettling.”
“Fine.”
Mrs. Osborne left the room, closing the door behind her.
Alone, Ulrich pulled out the chair attached to the desk. He
sat down, crossing his legs, and set aside the mail he had
been reading.
He tilted his head slightly. The blouse lay on the desk like a
discarded skin. He reached out and touched the limp sleeve.
It was a bright, sunny day, but a breeze that seemed fit for
nightfall swept through his fingers.
He didn’t need to look far.
It was last night.
Last night was replaying at the tips of his fingers.

Ulrich propped his chin on his hand and played with the
sleeve for a long time. His eyes didn’t see the blouse; they
were looking at something beyond it. It was as if he were
recalling a memory.
He remembered the moment he was blocked.
That same restraint had stopped him from impulsively
kissing her.
Ulrich slowly stood up. Still holding the sleeve, the blouse
hung limply from his hand like a dead body.
He spread the thin fabric out on the desk.
It matched. Lisbell had worn this when she came to the
pavilion last night.
“Hmm.”
He took a shallow breath.
“She seemed to have forgotten it in her haste to get ready
this morning, so I brought it with me.”
Mrs. Osborne had explained, somewhat bewildered. Ulrich
himself didn’t see Lisbell as someone who would carelessly
leave her clothes behind. As someone who aspired to be a
teacher, she seemed to have a meticulous and thorough
nature.
So, she must have been so agitated that she left her clothes
behind.
“Then it makes even less sense.”
Being agitated means being shaken, doesn’t it?
It meant that the strange atmosphere of last night wasn’t
something only he had felt. It wasn’t just his solitary
tension. The electrifying atmosphere that felt like it would
collapse with a single misstep was something both he and
she experienced.
But it was blocked.
Despite being captivated by the atmosphere, Lisbell had
rejected him.
And then she fled.
Leaving traces behind, like this.
This was a first in Ulrich’s life.
Being pitied by a mere commoner, and being rejected so
insultingly by such a wretched being.
He slowly lowered his hand.
Despite her conservative habits, the buttons of her blouse
had been fastened all the way to the top. Ulrich’s fingers
played with the topmost button. Then, suddenly, he flicked
it open.
The neckline opened easily. As he gazed down at the
unresisting fabric, he finally understood the source of the
discomfort he had been feeling since last night.
Ah, this is what I wanted to do.
“It’s Lisbell!”
It was just as she was about to step into the orphanage with
its wooden nameplate.
One of the children gathered in a small flowerbed turned her
head and shouted. The lively announcement caused the
children to jump up and rush over to Lisbell.
“Yes, yes. I’m back. Have you all been well?”
Lisbell crouched down to meet the children’s eyes, calling
each one by name. The named children’s cheeks blushed
with lively hues. They all clamored to speak at once, making
it difficult to understand them, but their joy was
unmistakable.
Only then did she feel like she was truly back in Misley. And
the little ones who made her feel this way were incredibly
endearing. Moments like these made her proud of her
dream to take care of children.

Her hand, which had been caressing a child’s cheek,
paused.
A sudden thought came to mind.
“Being a teacher doesn’t suit you, Lisbell.”
At the time, she had dismissed it lightly. But now, as it
resurfaced, it seemed she hadn’t entirely let it go.
Why did he say such a thing to me?
When she heard it, she had been more curious than
offended and had even asked why he thought that. He had
simply laughed and asked why she thought he would think
that, leaving the matter unresolved.
Lisbell was still curious about the reason.
But part of her didn’t want to know.
She was afraid.
In her life, the harsh reality she had to face repeatedly
involved financial issues. During this vacation, she had
unexpectedly met the wealthiest man in Rechem. To Lisbell,
money was the most daunting problem, which this man
effortlessly resolved and even used as a tool.
Perhaps because of that, he seemed like a god with absolute
power to her.
And what about Marnia, where he resided?
It was like a flawless fairy tale setting.
That’s what she had thought.
But her perspective had shifted slightly.
It wasn’t a fairy tale. Marnia was just an ordinary small
town. There must be people struggling day by day, just like
herself. It couldn’t be a dazzling fairy tale for everyone.
Only one person could experience such enchantment.
Paradise.
In other words, it was Ulrich’s paradise.
Sometimes lazy, sometimes diligent.
Changing one’s behavior according to one’s desires,
enjoying an economic freedom that others can hardly attain,
naturally accepting the luxuries that come with it, and
purely owning the background created by that luxury for
oneself.
No matter how you look at it, isn’t he like a god enjoying a
beautiful paradise?
Perhaps that’s why when he says something, it feels like an
absolute mark will be stamped deep inside. Hearing why he
said she wasn’t suited to being a teacher, she was secretly
afraid that it would harden her consciousness in that
direction.
“…Lisbell?”
She heard her name from afar. When she looked up, her
fiancé, Theodore, whom she hadn’t seen in about two
weeks, was standing there. He must have come out to see
what the commotion was about and found this scene.
Lisbell gave him a bright smile. Theodore, who had been
standing frozen as if he saw something he shouldn’t, came
running with a radiant smile like the children a moment ago.
“When did you get here? Why did you come so early? I
thought I wouldn’t see you until the afternoon.”
“I woke up early and took the first train.”
“I see… Let me carry your luggage.”
Theodore extended his arm. When Lisbell tried to hand it
over, the children playfully clung to the suitcase. Theodore
laughed heartily and then pretended to be stern.
“You rascals. Lisbell has just returned from a trip. She must
be very tired. Should you be bothering her like this?”
Nooo. The children replied, their mouths like little beaks
pecking. Theodore’s playful scolding spread waves of
laughter. Amidst the laughter, Lisbell followed Theodore
through the children as he grabbed her wrist and led her
away.
Fortunately, another teacher came out soon, having noticed
the commotion. Lisbell greeted and informed her of her
arrival, then headed to the dormitory with Theodore.
The room was filled with familiar sights: an old bed with a
wooden frame, a table with chipped paint, and a small vase
on the shabby windowsill. Seeing these familiar sights made
her feel at ease. It felt like she had returned to her proper
place. The guest room she stayed in at Marnia was
luxurious, but it always felt awkward and burdensome.
Once inside the room alone, Theodore pulled Lisbell close.
His tender kiss on her palm made Lisbell smile softly.
“I thought I was dreaming for a moment. Seeing your lovely
hair in the sunlight like a cloud…”
“Didn’t you expect me today?”
“I told you earlier! I thought you’d arrive in the afternoon. It
feels like I’ve received a surprise gift. Look, my heart is still
racing.”
He placed her hand on his chest. Lisbell, thinking he was
just expressing his happiness at seeing her sooner than
expected, felt the slightly faster rhythm of his heartbeat
through her palm.
Lisbell’s eyes widened like a rabbit’s, and Theodore laughed
innocently like a boy.
“So, did you have a good trip?”
“Yeah.”
“I’m sorry to hear you couldn’t persuade your mother.”
“Mother’s will was too strong.”
“But I understand her too. The villa is so spacious and
beautiful.”
Lisbell nodded while opening her suitcase on the bed.
Theodore perched beside her, his eyes sparkling.
“Come to think of it, you haven’t told me about that
person.”
“That person?”
“The owner of the villa. The nobleman of Altahart.”
Lisbell’s hands paused as she took out clothes from the
suitcase. Theodore continued without noticing.
“He’s the one who invited you to Marnia, covered all your
expenses there, and even wanted your mother to continue
working. He doesn’t seem like a bad person.”

“How was he? Did he seem alright?”
“…Yes, he was kind.”
Lisbell gave a brief reply and continued hanging her clothes
in the closet. Theodore naturally helped her. Despite her
lukewarm response, Theodore kept talking about Altahart.
“What did he look like?”
“Huh?”
“After you left, I looked up the capital newspaper. He looked
quite handsome in the photos. Was he the same in person?”
The image of his appearance, etched in her memory like a
new shock, resurfaced.
“Yeah, he looked like his photos.”
Lisbell busied her hands aimlessly and replied shortly. Her
responses were continually curt.
“That’s incredible. Really? He’s got all that money and even
perfect looks? That’s so unfair.”
“Unfair… Oh?”
Lisbell looked around. Theodore, crossing his arms and
clicking his tongue, turned to her.
“What’s wrong?”
“I can’t find my blouse.”
She went to the bed and checked her luggage. She sighed
after searching through her belongings.
“I think I left it at the villa.”
“What kind of blouse?”
“A light pink one.”
“Oh, that one. Isn’t that your favorite?”
Theodore squinted sympathetically. It would have been
possible to retrieve it if it were nearby, but it was a whole
day’s train ride away. She had to reluctantly give up.
Theodore comforted her, suggesting they visit the town
square’s clothing shop together.
“More importantly, Lisbell, I have news for you.”
“News?”
“It has finally arrived. From Renbruck.”
Lisbell’s eyes widened.
Renbruck was Theodore’s hometown. There was only one
thing they could have sent.
The wedding dress they needed for their wedding.
The wedding venue was naturally decided to be the chapel
of the Misley Orphanage, where they first met.
Theodore’s parents were initially disappointed and tried to
persuade them to change their minds. But both Lisbell and
Theodore were firm. They were determined to have the
ceremony at the place where their relationship began.
His parents eventually conceded but insisted on sending the
wedding dress. It was the dress his mother wore when she
married his father, a timeless design.
Theodore had said they could get a new dress if she
preferred, but Lisbell liked the idea. She knew it was a
handmade piece crafted from expensive silk specifically for
his mother by the factory his father owned. It would be far
better than a hastily made dress.
Besides, she was also worried about the cost. It was
essential to make the wedding special, but spending so
much for one day was daunting.
So there was no reason to refuse the wedding dress from
Renbruck.
“There’s really not much time left now.”
Theodore’s excited voice echoed as he brushed back her
hair and cupped her cheek. The warmth of his hand, his
calm eyes, and his resolute voice filled with anticipation
transferred to her, making her lips quiver.
His fresh green eyes looked down at her. In the suddenly
serene atmosphere, he tilted his head sideways. Their
shadows lengthened on the windowsill, drawing closer.
“…Huh?”
Just before their lips met, Theodore sensed her pushing his
chest and opened his half-closed eyes. His puzzled voice
came out naturally.
Up close, Lisbell looked more surprised by her own actions.
“Ah, I… I just got here and haven’t washed yet….”
I might smell…. she added in a small voice. Theodore was
momentarily silent before bursting into laughter.
“What are you talking about? There’s no way you smell. And
even if you did, so what?”
“Still….”
“Alright, alright. I was being insensitive, keeping you up
when you’re tired.”
He sat her on the bed and kissed her forehead. Lisbell
closed her eyes slowly in his affectionate gesture.
“I’ll bring your dinner to your room later. Rest until then. I’ll
tell the director you came back in your place.”
“Yeah, thanks, Theo.”
“No need to thank me.”
Theo patted Lisbell’s shoulder once before leaving the room.
Lisbell, staring at the closed door, collapsed onto her back.
As she blankly stared at the ceiling, she raised her fingers to
her lips.
Why…
Pressing her plump lower lip, she belatedly felt a sense of
doubt.
Why at that moment…
When Theo tried to kiss her, Lisbell remembered blue-grey
eyes. No, they came to mind. It wasn’t intentional; it was
instinctual. And instincts couldn’t be controlled—they were
close to the subconscious.

The confusion she thought she’d shaken off on the train ride
back rushed over her again, as if she had been mistaken all
along.
In fact, this consciousness had been ongoing since earlier.
“…Yes. He’s a kind person.”
Kind, but strictly speaking, a bit precarious and somewhat
strange. He would make silly remarks that sometimes didn’t
sound like jokes, which was peculiar.
“Yeah, he looked like his picture.”
It was a lie.
The moment she saw him, she was inwardly amazed,
thinking he was incomparable to the photo. He was the
most strikingly beautiful person Lisbell had ever seen.
Thus, in front of Theodore, she tried to avoid mentioning
that man.
As if she were guilty of a crime.
She didn’t understand it.
Although there had almost been an incident at the pavilion
that day, ultimately, nothing happened. So, she had nothing
to hide. She hadn’t done anything improper with another
man while engaged to be married.
So why did she feel so uncomfortable?
As if she’d done something wrong and was hiding it like a
child. In reality, nothing had happened between her and
Ulrich, not even a minor incident, yet why…
Lisbell turned over to face the wall.
The fingers that had been hovering near her mouth touched
her neck softly.
The man’s gaze had first swept over her like a lick, then his
tie had been gently tied. Their eyes had met horizontally.
Though usually his eyes were drowsy, whenever he looked
intently, his clear, bright eyes would shimmer intensely.
When she couldn’t even breathe before the vast wave-like
gaze, the tied tie was pulled tight…
Her throat tickled.
It felt like a dull needle was pricking the base of her throat.
Lisbell slowly rubbed her chest.
It felt uncomfortable and anxious, as if something was
weighing on her.

“My goodness.”
Theo, who had been watching her with more concentration
than when he took his college exams, exclaimed purely.
Lisbell, feeling embarrassed for some reason, lowered her
head. Seeing the orphanage teacher laugh at Theo’s
transparent expression made her even more embarrassed.
It wasn’t anything special. He was reacting this way in front
of Lisbell, who was trying on a wedding dress.
“I thought an angel had descended.”
“Theo…”
When she hinted for him to refrain from such comments in
front of others, Theo chuckled before inspecting her
seriously.
“There’s no need for alterations. It suits you perfectly,
Lisbell.”
Theo, who had risen from the chapel’s pew, approached. He
was also dressed in a fitted black suit.
Lisbell clenched and unclenched her tingling hands.
Standing face to face in such attire, and in a chapel no less,
made it feel like the real ceremony was about to take place.
Even though she knew it wasn’t the actual event, she felt a
fresh wave of nervousness.
Above all, Theo’s unwavering gaze on her brought a
pleasant exhilaration.
A late-summer bride.
A phrase someone had left in her mind suddenly came to
her.
“Sorry to break the mood.”
The teacher who had helped with the dress fitting cleared
her throat.
“But the waist needs some alteration. Lisbell’s frame is
small, so even when tightened, there’s still a lot of room.
This doesn’t look nice, and it would be uncomfortable for
Lisbell. A visit to the dress shop is necessary.”
“Really?”
Theo, as if waking from a dream, responded quickly. While
they were talking, the teacher left to answer a call from
outside.
Left alone in the chapel, Theo quietly cleared his throat. He
seated Lisbell, who was holding up the hem of her long
dress, on a nearby chair.
“Theo?”
With a gentle hand, he lifted the hem of the dress. Her shoeclad foot rested on his knee. Theo removed the shoe.
Lisbell flinched slightly as her pale, round foot was exposed.
Theo smiled and lifted something. It was a white shoe,
matching the dress she was wearing. It fit her perfectly, as if
prepared for her.
“When did you…”
“I prepared it while you were away from Misley.”

“You said you’d wear what mother had, but I wanted to get
you something of your own.”
The pink jewel on the edge of the shoe sparkled. It reminded
her of the day he proposed.
It was the day they graduated from college.
Under the falling cherry blossom petals, he shyly but
confidently confessed that he wanted to spend the future
together.
Even then, it didn’t feel real. But now, it did. Her heart
pounded. It was no longer something distant; their wedding,
their future, and all the dreams they had envisioned
together during college were just around the corner.
“It reminds me of the old days.”
“The old days?”
Lisbell whispered, touching the shoes as she bent over.
“The day you carried me back to the orphanage.”
It was during a vacation when she stayed at the orphanage.
They hadn’t officially started dating then. Though they
hadn’t formally dated, it was clear from the atmosphere and
vibes that they had feelings for each other.
They had gone to the square together due to a lack of toys
at the orphanage. Lisbell had collided with a child running
from the opposite direction and fell, twisting her ankle.
Unable to stand due to the pain, Theo had bent one leg and
shown his back. A signal to get on.
That day, as she was carried on his back to the orphanage,
they were drenched in the red sunset. They officially
became a couple from that day.
“That time.”
Theo began nostalgically.
“I was surprised by how light you were.”
“Liar.”
“It’s true.”
“Then why were you sweating so much?”
“It was hot.”
It was a sweltering summer.
“Even though my whole body was sticky with sweat, I didn’t
feel bad, which was strange.”

“That’s when I knew. This must be love.”

“And I made up my mind. No matter what, I would marry
you.”
His voice, filled with conviction, was confident. When Lisbell
laughed, saying, “What’s that,” Theo jokingly furrowed his
brows, insisting he was serious. Soon, his leisurely gaze
scanned Lisbell’s appearance.
“Look. See what you’re wearing now.”

“A wedding dress.”

“Our wedding is right around the corner, Lisbell, just as I
wished.”
Theo was genuinely happy.
After changing her other shoe to the new one, he kissed her
slightly exposed instep. Before she could protest that it was
dirty, it was already done. When Lisbell’s hand pushed his
shoulder away, Theo laughed heartily.
His laughter burst like fireworks in the chapel.
The warm noon sunlight poured down on the two of them.
In the afternoon, they went to a dress shop near the square
to have the dress altered. Taking advantage of being out,
they bought gifts for the orphans, explored new shops, and
enjoyed a pleasant leisure time at a café terrace.
It was a smooth day.
Amongst it all, Lisbell felt a relief no one else knew.
The turmoil she had felt on the day she returned from her
holiday in Marnia had now mostly faded. She still didn’t
understand why she felt that way, but since it had subsided,
she saw no need to dwell on it.
Gas lamps along the street began to light up.
Walking along the brightened path, she and Theo returned
to the orphanage. Distributing the candies they had bought
as gifts to the children, Lisbell entered the orphanage.
“Lisbell, are you back now?”
“Yes, Director.”
Thanks to her frequent visits since college, the orphanage
director was fond of Lisbell and Theo. It was entirely for this
reason that they were allowed to hold their ceremony in the
chapel, which was not usually permitted for personal use.
“Is something wrong?”
“A letter arrived for you, Lisbell.”
“A letter?”
“Yes. I left it on the table in your room.”
“Thank you for letting me know.”
After thanking the director, Lisbell headed to her room. She
placed her belongings down and approached the table. For a
moment, she thought it might be from her mother, but then
she realized her mother would have called the orphanage
directly instead of using such a cumbersome method.
As she picked up the letter, Lisbell paused. There was a
government seal on the edge, indicating it was an official
document.
The sender was from Marnia.
Lisbell hurriedly opened the envelope.
Her purple eyes quickly scanned the contents.
The official document was concise, with each paragraph
succinctly detailing the facts. A theft incident had occurred
in Marnia, and the local police were handling it. Helen
Osborne had been identified as a suspect and was currently
detained, with plans to bring her to trial in the capital. The
notice urging the procurement of legal representation was
brutally straightforward.
In essence, it meant her mother was involved in a theft
case. Not as a victim, but as the perpetrator.
It was a bolt from the blue. Lisbell reread the lines, unable
to comprehend what she was seeing. But no matter how
many times she read it, the meaning didn’t change. It
consistently conveyed the same information, wreaking
havoc in her mind.
“What is this….”
It made no sense.
Her mother, a thief?
Impossible. The mother she knew would never commit such
an act. Before she had Lisbell, she was a devout believer,
living an honest life. Even after being expelled from the
convent for having Lisbell, her mother had maintained her
integrity as a devout person.

Lisbell felt momentarily dizzy.
Was it three days ago? They had spoken on the phone about
the upcoming wedding expenses. When Lisbell complained
about the unexpected costs, her mother had expressed
concern.
Could it be…?
Lisbell quickly left the room, headed to the director’s office,
and asked to use the phone. But no matter how many times
she dialed, she couldn’t get through. As her eyes anxiously
darted around, she read the part of the letter stating that
the suspect was detained.
That meant her mother wasn’t at the Marnia villa. Realizing
this, Lisbell’s hand holding the receiver dropped.
What in the world was going on?
She had no way of knowing if her mother had actually done
such a thing. If it were true, what had she stolen to warrant
such a trial? If it were all a misunderstanding, how had she
ended up in this predicament? Lisbell had no way of finding
out.
At least, not in Misley.
Her mind racing, Lisbell returned to her room. She opened
her bag and quickly packed her things. Theodore, who had
come to ask if she would be having dinner, was surprised to
see his fiancée suddenly preparing to leave.
“Lisbell? What are you doing?”
“Theo, I think I need to go to Marnia for a bit.”
“What? What are you talking about?”
As she packed her small bag, Lisbell sighed. She hesitated
before handing Theodore the letter. Reading it quickly,
Theodore was as stunned as Lisbell had been.
“What is this…. Mrs. Osborne, you mean….”
“My mother would never do something so foolish.”
“Of course not! I believe that too. But did you try calling?”
“Yes. But… I couldn’t get through.”
Lisbell sighed deeply.
“I don’t know what’s going on, but I need to go to Marnia to
find out.”
“Right, of course…. Are you sure you’ll be okay alone?
Should I come with you?”
Despite being just as shaken, Theodore offered his help.
Lisbell gave him a faint smile and shook her head.
“No, I’ll go alone. It won’t take long.”
“Alright. Let me know as soon as you find out anything.”
Nodding, Lisbell hurried to the train station.
Far off, the sun was slowly setting.

Lisbell took a deep breath as she stepped off the carriage in
front of the path. Pushing through the small wooded area,
she soon saw part of the imposing villa.
It feels so different.
When she had walked this path before, she had been filled
with a vague excitement of being in a new city. Now, the
serene scenery didn’t register as her mind was in turmoil.
Not just that, it felt heavy and burdensome. Each step
seemed to add more weight to her feet.
Her fingers instinctively curled.

She finally reached the front of the villa.
Lisbell was taken aback. When she had visited with her
mother on vacation, the iron gate had been tightly shut.
Now, it was wide open as if welcoming someone.
She unfolded the paper she held. Having looked at it
countless times on the way here, the edges were curled,
and there were creases all over. Lisbell quickly glanced at
the address written on it.
“Rather than here, why don’t you try the villa?”
Before coming here, Lisbell had already been to the Marnia
police station.
“The key issue in cases like this often comes down to
leniency. Since the victim is the employer of Helen Osborne,
it might be a good idea to meet them directly and seek their
leniency. If the victim agrees, the police can close the case
without it going to trial.”
Judging by the investigator’s demeanor, it seemed the theft
had indeed occurred. If so, the suggestion wasn’t entirely
misplaced. If all these circumstances were true, Ulrich’s
leniency could resolve everything.
“Haah….”
The investigator had sent her to the villa, and the once
tightly shut gate was now wide open. It felt like she was
being invited into a well-orchestrated stage, making her
uneasy.
Lisbell swallowed hard and stepped through the gate.
Due to the summer that had quietly crept in over the past
month, the garden was filled with blue Queen of night
flowers. The topiary, sculptures, and garden arches were
adorned with contrasting red roses in full bloom.
The vibrant colors were almost overwhelming.
But perhaps that was just a narrow perspective.
Paradise.
Was this really paradise?
To Ulrich, this was probably just one of the many villas his
family owned. From what she had read in the newspapers,
his family owned over twenty second houses across the
country.
And most importantly, there was the capital.
A hotbed of gossip and culture.
The center of industrial advancement.
The pinnacle of high society where prominent families
gathered.
To Lisbell, Marnia had always been a place of admiration,
seen through the frame of a beautiful painting. If even this
place felt so impressive, what would the far more advanced
capital be like?
It must be even more splendid and magnificent.
And Ulrich would undoubtedly wield significant influence
there. In the center of a city driven by business, his solid
wealth and power would hold great sway.
Ultimately, both here and there were his paradises.
Her long musings returned to the harsh reality. The thought
of seeking leniency from such a formidable person left a
bitter taste in her mouth. Lisbell was like a small pond
compared to the vast ocean that was Ulrich.
But still…. There might be a chance.
She recalled her meeting with Ulrich a month ago. Although
he had his peculiarities, he was generally a man of mild
demeanor. His mannerisms were refined, and his language
and expressions carried the typical poise of a noble.
Despite their strained relationship, he didn’t seem like
someone who would mercilessly drive a person away.
…Or would he?
No matter how much she pondered, it was meaningless. She
had to confront him to get any answers.
With this resolve, she clenched her fist.
“Who are you?”
Lisbell stopped in her tracks. She saw a black sedan parked
next to the fountain. The voice belonged to a man standing
in front of the car. He had neatly groomed hair as black as
obsidian.
The face wasn’t unfamiliar. While he might not know her,
she recognized him. He was the man who had been
watching Ulrich practice shooting in the villa’s courtyard.
She had assumed he was Ulrich’s secretary.
The recollection existed solely for Lisbell. Naturally, the
man’s scrutinizing gaze made sense as he sized up the
unfamiliar intruder. Realizing this, Lisbell quickly bowed.
“Hello. I’m Lisbell Osborne.”
“Osborne?”
The man furrowed his brow.
His gaze fixed on her innocent face before he let out a small
exclamation of realization.
That wasn’t all. He lifted his hand from the car, tousling his
neatly groomed hair, and glanced somewhere in the villa,
his eyes narrowing as if encountering a bothersome
situation.
Lisbell, who had been puzzled, soon became terrified.
If this man was indeed Ulrich’s secretary, he might have
handled the theft that occurred here.
Could that be why he was acting this way?
Could it be why he shuddered at the mere mention of the
suspect’s name, ‘Osborne’?
Having not yet met Ulrich, Lisbell felt that the reaction of
this man, presumed to be his secretary, mirrored Ulrich’s
own. It was a situation that naturally instilled fear of
repercussions.
“I am Victor Loisden. I currently work under Master
Altahart.”
The man’s complexion changed in an instant. With an
emotionless expression, as if all feelings had been washed
away, he introduced himself and extended his hand for a
handshake.
“I have been waiting for you. Please follow me, I will guide
you.”
Although he didn’t seem like someone who had been
waiting, Lisbell silently followed Victor.
The corridor they walked through was quiet. It felt like an
invisible weight was pressing down on her. She knew she
needed to ask the secretary various questions to properly
understand the situation, but she couldn’t bring herself to
speak.
The only difference from the last time was not just the
atmosphere she felt.
Her position.
Her position in coming here had completely reversed.
From a guest to an unwelcome visitor.
Lisbell anxiously bit her lip, feeling like her clean neck was
exposed.
Victor stopped walking after a while. They were in front of a
large double door. He opened one of the doors and stepped
inside. Lisbell hesitantly followed his shadow.
The interior was closer to a reception room. The curtains
swayed in the open window. A gentle breeze blew in like the
breath of nature from afar.
Amid such a serene scene, there he was.
Ulrich Altahart.
She swallowed hard, feeling like the saliva stuck in her
throat was poison. It felt like evidence, burning her throat.
“Master, Miss Lisbell Osborne is here to see you.”
His platinum-blonde hair moved slightly, as if he had been
looking at some documents.
Sitting on the sofa, Ulrich turned to the door. Victor Loisden
took a step back and bowed his head as he saw Ulrich
acknowledging this.
“Then I will leave.”
“No need for tea.”
“Yes, sir.”
Just as there was no embellishment in the words announcing
her arrival, Victor left the reception room without any
unnecessary actions. Left alone in an instant, Lisbell wiped
the sweat from her palms on her skirt.
“You’ve come, Lisbell.”
A low voice addressed her, but she couldn’t lift her head,
her mind in turmoil. His tone was as calm as when they
parted ways.
Gathering her courage, Lisbell looked up.
At a glance, his expression seemed the same. Despite
harboring the family of someone who stole from him,
Ulrich’s face showed no strong emotion. It was calm and
moderate, like the surface of a lake. Even after a long look,
she could not find any sign of anger or irritation.
“Why don’t you come over here instead of standing there?”
He gestured with his head, his neck probably stiff from
looking her way. Lisbell quickly moved her feet.
She carefully sat on the multi-person sofa beside him. As
usual, documents were piled around him. Ulrich placed the
document he was holding on top of the pile and rubbed the
back of his neck. His relaxed demeanor, in stark contrast to
her nervousness, tightened her insides.
“I received the letter on my way here.”
Ulrich, crossing one leg over the other, gave her a listening
look. Encouraged by this, Lisbell forced her stiff tongue to
move.
“They say my mother has committed… some wrong.”
“Hmm.”
He extended a finger from the hand supporting his chin and
tapped his cheek.
“It’s a simple story. A few days ago, a ring kept in my
bedroom disappeared. It was a ring my mother meticulously
designed and ordered when I came of age.”
“…”
“It’s practically an antique to me now, something I rarely
wear… but it’s still quite valuable, so I couldn’t just ignore
its disappearance. So, I ordered a search of the villa.”
“…”
“Guess where it was found?”
Though posed as a question, it was not really one. With the
answer so obvious, it couldn’t be considered a question.
“Oddly enough, it was in Mrs. Osborne’s wardrobe.”
Lisbell’s fingers curled on her lap. Her skirt was pulled and
wrinkled like her troubled mind.
“My mother…”
Her tongue, even stiffer than before, moved reflexively, but
she couldn’t continue speaking. Her mind was swirling. An
overwhelming confusion was like a storm cloud.
As Lisbell struggled to speak, Ulrich calmly added.
“To be honest, I didn’t intend for things to escalate this
much. Would I, who came here to escape the noise of the
capital, really blow this out of proportion over a missing
ring? It’s more of a hassle for me, too.”
“…”
“But in our family, the principle is to report everything to the
household. Anything that happens within my vicinity must
be reported to the main house. That’s how my mother heard
about it. She’s the type who needs to take action on
anything, so things turned out this way.”
No wonder.
Despite it being a minor theft compared to a grave crime
like murder, talk of a trial in the capital had already
surfaced.
Punishing a servant for attempting to steal from the master,
if it was a family matter, wasn’t impossible. His family was
no ordinary one. To clear her foggy mind, Lisbell dug her
nails into her palm.
“My mother…”
“…”
“May I see her?”
Ulrich wiggled the foot of his crossed leg.
Lisbell glanced up and met his gaze.
A cold wind brushed past.
It wasn’t the breeze coming through the open window. It
was the enigmatic gaze she had seen under the starry sky
of the pavilion at night. His eyes were calm, yet they evoked
a tension as if they might snap at any moment.
Her heart pounded. Feeling guilty, she quickly lowered her
gaze.
“I believe there is some misunderstanding. The mother I
know would never do such a thing.”
“Hmm. People are multi-faceted, Lisbell. There’s a reason
they are described as three-dimensional beings.”
“…”
“A desire hidden from her daughter might have manifested
differently. Isn’t that possible?”
Snap, the center of the hope she had held shattered.
“Frankly, I am quite disappointed. Although I didn’t know
Mrs. Osborne well, I believed she was diligent and honest.
Not only that, but she was also neat and perceptive… It’s
infuriating the more I think about it.”
As he continued speaking, Lisbell felt any chance of leniency
from the him slipping away.
Of course, it was understandable. He had raised her
mother’s salary for her good work, even covered the
expenses for her daughter’s stay here, only to be betrayed
like this. Ulrich’s indignation was entirely justified.
Yet, it still didn’t make sense to her.
Even amidst the rapidly unfolding situation, Lisbell’s faith in
her mother remained unwavering. It was built over a long
time and couldn’t be shattered in a moment. That was their
relationship and their love.
Lisbell closed her eyes tightly and then opened them.
“Somehow, just once, even briefly, could you allow me to
speak with my mother…?”
Instead of responding, Ulrich leisurely smiled and tilted his
head. Despite using words like disappointment and
infuriating, his demeanor was playful. Yet, his gaze
remained probing. It felt like she was being examined under
a predator’s sharp claws. Every nerve in her body felt on
edge.
“I want to hear about the situation directly from her. The
mother I know is not a greedy person. Even if she had
desires, she wouldn’t achieve them through unjust
means…!”
“Does that mean….”
The low voice that flowed like water cut off Lisbell’s protest.
“Are you saying I’m lying?”
Startled, Lisbell straightened up.
The temperature in his gaze dropped. His cold stare felt like
a dagger digging into her.
Goosebumps rose all over my body. It was a slip of the
tongue caused by the chaos. Regardless, it was my fault. In
a position where I had to plead for mercy, I was guilty no
matter what attitude the man took.
Lisbell was frozen and couldn’t move for a while, then she
finally stirred.
Ulrich’s eyes fell solemnly. They followed the woman as she
knelt beneath the sofa.
He raised an eyebrow with interest.
“That’s not what I meant. I couldn’t believe my mother did
such a thing… If I offended you, I sincerely apologize.”
“Try.”
“…Pardon?”
“Apologize.”
The tip of his pointed shoe wavered. Kneeling before him,
Ulrich’s shoe was near Lisbell’s face. If it swung wrongly, it
could hit her ear. It suddenly served as a means to prove his
and her positions, and the darkness grew before her eyes.
“Come to think of it, those pretty lips have never apologized
before.”

“Didn’t you come here to beg for my mercy?”
He pressed coldly with eyes that had turned icy, questioning
how she could even think of not moving her lips in
supplication.
His behavior was generally dignified, and his tone was calm
and deliberate, never hurried or excited. Ulrich was still
Ulrich. Like a statue stimulating aesthetic consciousness, he
was beautiful and refined.
Yet, she couldn’t understand why he felt so vulgar. The
invisible force emanating from him made her lungs ache as
if they were being squeezed.
“I’m… I’m sorry.”

“I’m truly sorry. It pains me that I can only express this in
such a pitiful manner. I sincerely apologize. I’m really sorry
to have caused you unnecessary trouble over such a
matter.”
Her voice trembled. Instinctive fear gnawed at her hands
and feet. Lisbell wanted to grovel on the floor and beg if she
could. She could actually do so. She could do it repeatedly if
it could smooth over this situation.
While Lisbell’s delicate voice shook like a trembling aspen in
her apology, Ulrich observed her with calm eyes.
The man’s beautifully grown eyelashes fluttered. His eyelids
blinked slowly, giving the impression of drowsiness, yet the
focus in his pupils was too sharp for that. They seemed to
hold a bluish glint, as if on the edge of anger.
Lisbell felt every bit of his intensely focused gaze on her
skin. She thought rolling over a bed of thorns would be
better than this. The coldness settled into her like a wound
that bled all over her body.
She didn’t understand.
Why she kept feeling this chilling sense of foreboding….
DongAt that moment, the sound of a large bell covered the
drawing room where the two were seated.
The sound of a church bell.
Before they knew it, the time had shifted from morning to
afternoon.
The shadows of the two people lying on the floor grew
longer. Lisbell couldn’t even lift her head and traced only
their shadows. Before the bell finished ringing, Ulrich rose
from the sofa. His shoe, which had been threateningly
hovering in the air, was now placed right next to Lisbell’s
hand on the floor.
Although there was some distance between them, the sense
of oppression made it feel like the sole of that shoe was
pressing her down with an unbearable weight.
“Do you want to save your mother?”
Lisbell lifted her bowed head. The man standing right in
front of her was looking down at her arrogantly.
The deafening bell sound rang in and out like a tinnitus.
Reality seemed to drift far away.
“…Yes.”
“How much?”

“How much do you want to save her?”
It was a strange question.
But she had to answer. Instinct told her so. Lisbell hastily
moved her dry tongue.
“Enough to try everything I can…”
“Hmm.”

“So, you’ll do anything.”
The man pulled his chin back and smiled. Unfortunately, the
backlight made it impossible to read his expression except
for his smiling lips. Lisbell stared up at him, trying to read
the emotions behind it.
She soon realized she didn’t need to.
Ulrich bent down and grabbed Lisbell’s chin. The grayish
backlight that had cast over his face disappeared, replaced
by the bright noon light.
But that light was murky.
The light that should have been radiant and brilliant from
the sun was inexplicably gloomy.
Soon, she realized.
It wasn’t the sunlight that was murky and gloomy.
“…Hmph!”
It was the moment the bell tolled twelve times, like the final
judgment.
His lips pressed against hers.
Lisbell’s eyes widened as if they would pop out.
Instinctively, she tried to push him away, but Ulrich, who
had anticipated this, overpowered her with his dominant
strength. Her body toppled backward without resistance.
The sensation of her vision flipping was similar to the world
turning upside down. Above her, his much larger frame
loomed.
“Ah!”
Ulrich’s tongue invaded her open mouth. The wet flesh
fumbled inside her lips. The realization that another man’s
tongue, not her fiancé’s, was stirring her insides made her
body go numb with shock.
“Hmph! Urgh…!”
As soon as she grasped the situation, she raised her arms to
push against his chest. But Ulrich didn’t budge.
On the contrary, he chuckled as if amused by her futile
resistance and adjusted his grip to make it easier to suck on
her chin. When she shook her head to shake off his hand,
his grip on her jawbone tightened as if to break it. A painful
groan escaped as her cheeks were crushed.
From then on, he was completely absorbed in the kiss,
tilting his head to deepen it. He chewed her flesh until it
swelled, then slipped his tongue in to explore her palate.
Every time his tongue brushed against Lisbell’s, which was
trembling in shock, he rubbed against it more firmly. Their
saliva thickened, hotly wetting each other’s mouths. Her
throat grew moist, while her chest turned cold.
“… Urgh…!”
Lisbell’s legs lifted and her skirt slid down as she lay
sprawled on the floor. Ulrich’s fingers naturally followed the
path her skirt had taken. Shivers ran down Lisbell’s spine as
his fingers grasped her knee and slid up to the inside of her
thigh.
“Ugh, ”
She struggled fiercely, but overcoming his strength was
impossible. Her violent movements hit the table, causing it
to shake. A stack of papers on it tumbled over the two of
them.
That was the moment Ulrich removed his mercilessly glued
lips from hers.
He pushed himself up with his forearms on either side of
Lisbell, licking his lips as if savoring a taste. It was a gesture
as if he were relishing the flavor of some food.
“Ah, as I thought.”
Thud.
Lisbell’s body, which had been heaving to catch her breath,
stiffened. Something pressed and rubbed against the inside
of her thighs. A man’s crotch occupied the space between
them. Unable to turn her gaze to it, Ulrich smiled a fragrant
smile at her.
“This is it.”

“This is what I wanted.”
There was an overwhelming heat in his voice, making it
difficult for Lisbell to handle. Trying to calm her wildly
beating heart, she spoke hesitantly.
“Are you… perhaps drunk…?”
“I haven’t touched a drop of alcohol today.”

“I’m completely sober.”
He played with Lisbell’s gray hair sprawled on the floor and
then lowered himself again. As his face came close again,
Lisbell shrank back. He chuckled and changed his direction.
His lips curved generously as they touched Lisbell’s ear.
“One more thing.”

“I was perfectly sober that day too.”
Thump Thump Thump.
Her heartbeat was so vivid she feared it might burst out of
her mouth.
Lisbell slowly turned her eyes toward him from where they
had been staring into space. His slightly relaxed eyes
glowed with a wild intensity, staring sharply at her.
Yes, this is it.
This was the ominous feeling I had.
Unlike Lisbell, who was frozen as if bound by invisible ropes,
Ulrich was like a free bird. He was a hawk capable of
catching and devouring a mouse that only knew how to run
away.
His lower body, which had been rubbing and pressing
against her legs as if to make his presence known, slid
further into the intimate space between her thighs. His
groin, which had swollen considerably, now completely
interlocked with her crotch.
Then, he thrust his hips.
With that light movement, Lisbell flinched, her eyelids
trembling. Ulrich, ensuring their lower bodies stayed
connected, rubbed his clothed manhood against her,
bringing his lips to her neck.
“No… uh, don’t, Ulrich…!”
Lisbell begged, struggling like an animal caught in a trap.
“Please, don’t do this. Don’t…”

“No, please. Don’t…! I’m getting married soon!”
Her pleas poured out desperately. It had to be that way.
Ulrich, who was now overtly driven by rising lust, seemed
ready to go all the way right here.
Chapter 23.
Lisbell’s eyes welled up with transparent tears out of sheer
fear. Meanwhile, the pressure sucking on her neck was
intense.
“Ulrich! Please, I have… Ah! I have someone who promised
me a future…!”
In the midst of her breaking sobs, Theodore’s bright, smiling
face flashed in her mind.
It was driving her crazy. Regret kept washing over her.
She should have just accepted Theodore’s offer to come
with her. She should have come to Marnia with him. If she
had done that, she wouldn’t be in this situation now…
“uh…”
Suddenly, a soft laugh echoed in her ear.
Lisbell, with tear-drenched eyes, turned her head clumsily.
Ulrich, unable to completely stifle his laughter, lifted his
head from her neck.
Lisbell stared at him in horror.
She was crushed under the weight of despair, caught
between hell and reality, while Ulrich bore a nonchalant
smile, causing a mild dizziness. If she had been standing,
she might have staggered.
“Is this about keeping your premarital chastity no matter
what?”
“…”
“My goodness. Lisbell, you’re living centuries ago. Who
cares about that these days?”
Still unable to contain his laughter, he chuckled
intermittently even as he spoke.
Lisbell, pinned under his sleek but undeniably intimidating
frame, feared what new danger might arise from this
sudden pause.
Ulrich’s fingers brushed up Lisbell’s slender neck. A red
bruise, freshly left by his lips, lay there like the seed of sin.
“I’ve changed my mind.”
Each word he dropped felt like a signal of impending doom
to Lisbell. Her throat tightened, making her swallow bitterly.
She stiffened her cheeks.
“You asked for my mercy, didn’t you?”
“…”
“Then come to the room next to the study.”
“But that’s…”
“That’s my bedroom.”
He got up from his position. Lisbell, as if her mind had shortcircuited, lay on the floor staring at the ceiling. It was only
moments later that she realized the weight pressing her
down was gone, and she scrambled to her feet.
In the meantime, Ulrich had returned to the sofa and lit a
cigarette. Despite his lower half still prominently aroused,
he smoked with an air of casualness. It was a skill to carry
such an appearance without seeming crude.
“What do you mean…”
Lisbell managed to ask as Ulrich exhaled a puff of smoke.
“It means come to me voluntarily.”
“…”
“Abandon your loyalty to your beloved fiancé and come to
me yourself.”
The darkness in his smile as he glanced at her seemed to
dim the sunlight itself.
Something dark and slimy lurked in his tone.
“I’m curious to see if your steadfast devotion can really do
that.”
It was like the saliva dripping from the tongue of a devil.

“I’ll wait patiently until sunset.”
“…”
“If you don’t come by then, I’ll consider that you’ve given up
on my mercy.”
Ulrich left the drawing room after leaving those words
behind, abandoning Lisbell, who had slumped down from
the chaotic situation.
Lisbell remained a statue until the scent of the cigarette he
had smoked faded away completely. The first thing she did
after regaining her senses was to hastily cover her exposed
neckline with trembling hands.
“Ha…”
A long sigh escaped her lips.
He had left, but his words lingered in her ears. Lisbell
rubbed her ears frantically, trying to erase them. But it was
in vain. Those words were etched in her mind, not her
hearing.
“To my bedroom.”
There was no way she could misunderstand the meaning. It
was an extension of the act that nearly happened here. He
intended to…
Lisbell abruptly stood up and forced her trembling legs to
move toward the door. She felt the cold touch of the
doorknob in her hand.
She had to grab it, open it, and leave.
She had to get out.
Just as the man who left without any hesitation, she too had
to leave without looking back.
But.
But if she did…
If she did, what would happen to her mother…?
The thoughts overlapped like a malfunctioning machine.
What would happen to her mother?
The answer appeared too clearly in her shaken mind.
Her mother would become a clear-cut criminal.
Is that all?
If the case escalated beyond the local police to the capital
court, she might have to hire a lawyer as her mother’s only
family.
Although she had never been involved in such matters, she
knew that lawyer fees weren’t something you could casually
mention. She didn’t have that kind of money. Even if she
did, it would be at the expense of the bright future she had
dreamt of with Theodore.
It would mean giving up her future.
But if she didn’t give up that future, her mother might end
up in prison. The opponent was the Altahart family. They
had the power to make her mother rot in jail for the rest of
her life for stealing a single ring.
Mercy.
No matter how she thought about it, that was the only
solution. It was the simplest and most effective way. One
word from Ulrich could end this situation quickly.
And the condition for that mercy…
Why?
A chilling question arose.
Why is this happening to me?
Unable to open the drawing room door, Lisbell slid down in
front of it. She barely supported herself with her palms on
the floor. The cold touch of the bare floor chilled her. Her
body and heart continued to cool.
She wanted to run away. Her heart pounded wildly, driving
her mad.
The image of Ulrich kissing her, the sensation of a stranger’s
weight crushing her, the slimy hot tongue licking her neck—
all of it was so vividly alive it was terrifying.
The ritual she had desperately avoided the night before she
left the pavilion had materialized.
Guilt…
The guilt of having done such a thing with another man,
despite being engaged to another, formed like ice in her
heart. The more she dwelled on it, the stronger her urge to
run away became. There were no physical barriers
preventing her escape, but invisible shackles held her
ankles.
Mother.
If she ran away now, her mother’s fate would be sealed.
“…uh.”
It was a cruel weighing of scales.
“Huff…”
To keep her promise to Theodore, she would have to
abandon her mother. Conversely, to save her mother, she
would have to betray Theodore.
Why did it have to be like this?
Why did she have to be stuck in such a dreadful situation,
caught between the two people she loved most in the
world? How did she end up at such a cliff’s edge?
How?
As Lisbell stared blankly at the ornate design on the door,
her upper body slowly leaned forward.
Her forehead touched the cold floor. A silent scream
escaped her open mouth. A single ray of sunlight fell warmly
on her outstretched foot. The uncomfortable warmth
scratched at her, reminding her of the last memory
fragment of Marnia left in the dust.
It hadn’t been long since the bell rang at noon, but the sun
had set too quickly.
No, it was that Lisbell hadn’t been able to make a decision
swiftly.
It was a painful time.
Like a praying person, she lay on the floor for a long time,
unable to move, before she slowly got up and wandered
aimlessly around the drawing room. She repeatedly grasped
the doorknob she had given up on turning, and sat idly on
the sofa, staring at her feet.
It was a battle between what she couldn’t endure now and
what she might not endure in the future.
After long contemplation, Lisbell chose the present. She
decided to save her mother, who was in immediate danger.
After all, her mother’s situation was already a reality, but
her future with Theodore hadn’t happened yet.
She just needed to secure Ulrich’s mercy. That way, she
could save her mother and end this situation here. It was
undeniable that her own sacrifice was the fastest and
easiest path.
The “act” with Ulrich tonight would be dreadful and
disgusting, but as long as she wasn’t caught, it was a risk
she could take.
If Theodore never found out…
She painfully realized that just considering such a secret
meant she was starting to deceive him, but she forced
herself to ignore it.
She couldn’t abandon her struggling mother.
In the isolated space, Lisbell reached a conclusion that
gnawed at her heart.
Of course, just deciding to do it didn’t make the situation
any easier. My fingertips trembled as I barely managed to
turn the doorknob to the reception room.
Is this the right thing?
Is this the right decision?
As I stood in front of his bedroom door, next to the study,
the mental conflict continued to gnaw at me. My lungs felt
like they had turned to stone, and my breathing was so
erratic I wasn’t sure how I was even getting air. The tension
and overwhelming resignation made my chest tighten.
Knock, knock.
I knocked as if I were knocking on the gates of hell.
I heard a response from inside, but my head was so fuzzy I
couldn’t make out the words. Assuming it was an invitation
to come in, I turned the doorknob.
Ulrich was sitting on the edge of his desk, the receiver
wedged between his ear and shoulder. While I had been
curled up on the floor, consumed by my wretched worries,
he had been calmly dealing with business.
He glanced at me with just a flick of his eyes.
“Finished worrying?”
He asked as he ended the call. It was both a question and a
prompt. He was urging me to make a decision as I stood just
outside the room. Lisbell bit her lip to keep from crying,
forcing herself to wake from her dazed state.
“Mercy…”
“Hmm?”
“Will you promise me mercy?”
“Oh.”
Ulrich, as if suddenly recalling it, put down the receiver and
straightened his back. The intense twilight slowly creeping
in behind him was a terrifyingly grand sight.
“Alright, fine. A promise.”

“Should I pinky swear?”
His casual attitude, regardless of the situation, seemed
almost deliberate. Lisbell shook her head quickly, putting
strength into her voice.
“No. A proper, a proper promise.”
Ulrich chuckled and said, “Yes, yes.”
“With evidence.”
His delayed understanding was almost infuriatingly cold. As
I stared at him with sorrowful eyes, Ulrich gestured for me to
come closer.
As I walked slowly towards him, he pulled out a document
and a fountain pen. He bit off the pen cap with his molars,
then scribbled something on the back of the document with
the sharp nib. He then handed it to the approaching Lisbell.
It was the letter of clemency she had desperately wanted,
detailing his promise to show leniency towards Mrs. Osborne
as a victim of the incident, signed in Ulrich’s own hand. 
As she reached for it, Ulrich’s hand withdrew it just a
moment before she could grasp it.
“Not yet.”

“Our deal hasn’t even started.”

“We can’t have both mother and daughter branded as
thieves, right?”
Ulrich stood up. Lisbell could only watch anxiously as the
paper was placed in the third drawer of his desk.
Returning to her, he loosened his tie, which suddenly caught
Lisbell’s attention.
In this situation, it was a realization of no help.
She hadn’t known in the reception room. It would have been
better if she had continued not knowing…
The tie he was loosening was the one Lisbell had given him.
If only she had never known…
He stood before Lisbell, casually toying with the loosely
knotted tie, looking far too refined to be proposing such a
lowly deal. Unlike her, who had been driven here with a
heart full of despair, he remained impeccably composed,
almost bringing her to tears.
Yes, even after today, he would remain unchanged. Unlike
her, who would be personally destroyed, Ulrich Altahart
would continue his life as effortlessly as ever.
Seeing her swallow her boiling tears, he smiled. His
beautiful smile only made her feel as if the ground were
sinking beneath her feet.
His appearance suggested that women might voluntarily
kneel and approach to warm his bed. Given his convenient
and efficient looks, it was unfathomable why he would
demand such unjust and despicable actions from someone
promised to another. If she could understand it, she
wouldn’t be here.
Ulrich reached out. His touch, surprisingly warm, made
Lisbell flinch.
“Why are you crying already?”

“I don’t like women who cry outside the bed.”
It was only upon hearing Ulrich’s words that Lisbell realized
she was crying. Her tears were hot, so hot it felt as though
they might melt her spirit. She almost wished they would, so
she could avoid this situation. She wished she could become
dust and disappear from the world.
Ulrich, who had been rubbing her pale, frozen cheek,
grasped her slender chin.
He lifted her face, bringing their lips close. Unlike in the
daytime reception room, he leisurely licked her wet cheek.
The unusual contact made her flinch.
“uh…”
Lifting her chin higher, he extended his tongue, licking away
her tear tracks. It was a meaningless gesture, as his saliva
replaced the tears. Watching him lap at her like a starving
man, it was clear there was no kindness in his actions.
His tongue wandered her cheek before finally covering her
lips.
When Lisbell instinctively tried to pull away, he wrapped an
arm around her waist, pulling her onto the bed.
Feeling like a sacrificial offering, Lisbell lifted her upper body
before he could fully pin her down. With Ulrich’s upper body
immediately over her, they maintained an awkward angle.
Ulrich attacked with an open mouth from the start. Sucking
her lower lip until it lost color, he then licked the seam of
her upper lip as if exploring its taste.
“, .”
Unable to breathe, her hand trembled. Ulrich pushed his
tongue deep into her mouth. Lisbell’s back arched. When
she tried to turn her head, Ulrich grabbed her nape firmly,
signaling he wouldn’t allow it.
“Ahh… ”
His fierce tongue explored every corner of her mouth, slick
saliva overflowing. Ulrich seemed determined to make her
swallow it, slipping his tongue to the edge of her throat.
Helpless, Lisbell could only gulp down his breath and saliva.
Ulrich’s tongue thoroughly coated hers, licking and sucking
it before releasing it. A silver thread extended between their
parted lips, both thoroughly soaked.
“Clumsy.”
“Ha, ahh…”
“I’ve never had such a poor kiss before.”
It was exasperating, but at least novel.
“A woman with a fiancé…”
Despite her engagement, her body reacted vulnerably to
every new $exual stimulus. It was as if she had never
experienced such touches.
It was obvious.
The man she was to marry must be just as dull and
lukewarm. They were perfectly matched.
“What’s your fiancé’s name?”

“Your fiancé’s name, Lisbell.”
Gently stroking the back of her neck, he coaxed an answer.
Lisbell kept her mouth shut. Already feeling sinful about
being in this bed, she didn’t want to bring up Theodore,
even in passing. For tonight, she wanted to bury everything
about her fiancé deep within herself.
But rebellion didn’t work with Ulrich.
“Ah!”
The once gentle hand suddenly grabbed a handful of her
hair.
“Name.”
“uh…”
“Do I need to ask three times?”
Impatient with her stubbornness, he pressed another kiss
onto her with a slightly irritable demeanor.
Chapter 25.

A kiss is supposed to be a romantic act, but this one only felt threatening, as if it intended to force its way in if resisted.

 

It was no mere illusion.

 

Ulrich bit down hard enough on his own lips to draw blood. The bitten corners of his mouth split open. The sting spread without resistance from the torn flesh. Swallowing back sobs, Lisbell spoke in a deeply immersed tone.

 

“Theodore….”

 

“Theodore.”

 



 

“What exactly did you do with Theodore?”

 

As expected, even that name had become a means to push the current humiliating and degrading situation further. The name of her fiancé, slipping from his sinful lips, was horrifying.

 

Unable to respond, Ulrich pressed his fingers against her tear-streaked cheek and then withdrew them.

 

“If this is how you kiss, it’s obvious you haven’t had sex.”

 

A strange spark flickered in the man’s eyes as he muttered lowly.

 

Lisbell recognized those eyes.

 

On a chilly night when the wind blew across the lawn, he had playfully tied her necktie in the pavilion. During that nerve-wracking moment, Ulrich, while tying the tie, had soon….

 

“Ah!”

 

Like this, he had tried to kiss roughly.

 

The previous kiss now seemed like child’s play as Ulrich frantically sucked on her lips. His grip on the nape of her neck tightened, preventing any escape. His excitement throbbed within, pinching and stirring his core.

 

“Uh! ”

 

His tongue plunged into Lisbell’s mouth, threatening to take over, stabbing deeply as if to control her breath. Unlike the tender bird kisses she’d shared with Theodore, which were light and fleeting, this was seething with terrifying passion.

 

From the start, he twisted his tongue around hers, teasingly violating her, then later pulled her entire tongue into his mouth to suck. Her face grew hot, and her mouth filled with saliva. Their overlapping, parting lips were already a saliva-drenched mess. The scene was unbelievably obscene.

 

“Ha….”

 

He leisurely rolled his tongue, savoring every corner of her wet mouth. His kiss was erratic, switching from fast to slow, urgent to leisurely, showcasing excessive indulgence like an unpredictable jest.

 

Whatever it was, her chest swelled as if it would burst. She had never felt so suffocated in her life. It felt as if an invisible hand was strangling her.

 

“…Huh!”

 

Lisbell’s delicate violet eyes quivered. Ulrich’s hand boldly slid inside her skirt, tracing the line of her underwear on her thin thighs. His touch was so explicit that she felt humiliated.

 

“Ha….”

 

Withdrawing his head, Ulrich released her tormented lips.

 

Breathing heavily, he groped inside her skirt while staring her in the face. Despite his neat, shining face, his hand gestures were vulgar.

 

Lisbell flinched repeatedly. The weight pressing subtly on her lower abdomen was unsettling. When they had tumbled together on the sofa in the parlor, she had felt Ulrich’s erection stiff against her.

 

“Ah!”

 

His hand, which had been probing between her legs, circled around to grab her buttocks. Squeezing hard enough to make her twitch like having a fit, the obscene touch was unprecedented. The intent behind his touch was clear and it made her skin crawl.

 

“Uh, .”

 

As he spread her buttocks apart and rubbed the cleft connecting to her intimate area with his long middle finger, the touch was excruciatingly stimulating. Even though he wasn’t touching her bare skin, just rubbing over the cloth, it felt as if her skin was being rubbed raw.

 

“Your butt is small. It fits in one hand.”

 

“….”

 

“Are your breasts this small too? Then there’s nothing to fondle.”

 

Muttering self-assessed remarks, he bent his head forward.

 

He caught the ribbon tied at her blouse neckline between his teeth and pulled without hesitation.

 

The fabric slid smoothly.

 

He took the top button between his teeth. Somehow, after a few chews, the button popped open.

 

As he unbuttoned the second one, his hand continued to relentlessly rub her perineum. His intense desire to penetrate beyond the fabric was palpable. Lisbell felt utterly suffocated as he blocked her from all sides.

 

“Uh…!”

 

Then a sharp moan escaped all at once.

 

He had undone the buttons down to her cleavage and pulled back the thin fabric. Her breasts, with their pink tips, lay almost weightlessly in his hand.

 

“Small breasts and even smaller nipples.”

 

Lisbell’s body shuddered once more. He grabbed the tiny breasts firmly, as if trying to gather up the small flesh. His strong grip felt like it would tear off her flat chest.

 

“With this, I doubt there’s any pleasure in biting.”

 

“Ah…!”

 

Muttering discontentedly, he enveloped the small mound with his mouth. The dreadful sensation shot painfully through her limbs.

 

Unintentionally struggling, Lisbell’s nipple got caught painfully. She let out an incoherent moan and shook her head wildly. Her pale feet kicked the sheets fiercely.

 

“Ha, ha…!”

 

No matter how flat, a breast was still a breast. Enveloped in hot, wet saliva, the nipple stiffened to a point. The prickling sensation spreading below her waist was strangely peculiar. The unfamiliar feeling surged, making her want to flee.

 

Ulrich greedily sucked on the small flesh filling his mouth, holding Lisbell’s arms to immobilize her.

 

The pale coral-colored nipple was soaked in his saliva. As his tongue flicked against it, it swelled and darkened slightly. He persistently rolled his tongue, savoring the hue. Each time, Lisbell’s limbs trembled as if in torment.

 

He had never seen a woman whose nipples weren’t erogenous. Realizing she was feeling it, Ulrich laughed softly and sucked a mouthful of her breast.

 

“Ah, stop…! Please, stop…!”

 

With tear-filled eyes, Lisbell begged. Ulrich ignored her. He merely tapped her buttocks lightly, while still hungrily suckling her breast.

 

Despite their modest size, her breasts were soft, with a comforting scent that made him want to bury his nose in them. It was a scent that imprinted not just on his nose but in his heart.

 

He continued his vulgar teasing, licking her nipples, and eventually freed her other breast from her bra.

 

By then, Lisbell’s blouse was barely hanging on, exposing her breasts and navel. It couldn’t even be considered as being worn.

 

After mashing his face against her flat breasts, Ulrich finally lifted his head. His large hands grabbed both her breasts at once. The nipples, helplessly rubbed by his tongue, stood erect, looking ripe and enticing. He liked how they had swollen, making them perfect for tormenting.

 

“Your nipples are hard.”

 

Dropping the remark as if to inform her, Lisbell, who had been hiding her face with her forearms, trembled. Even his casual flicks at her protruding nipples made her cheeks tremble. Her lips, exposed under her arm, quivered repeatedly. The unfamiliar contact was overwhelming. She desperately wished for it to end quickly.

 

“Just….”

 

Unable to bear it any longer, her crumpled lips parted.

 

“Just do it… Please….”

 



 

“Not this, anything but this.”

 

“Anything but what.”

 



 

“Just shove it in?”

 

His voice lowered, as if annoyed by the interruption of his amusement.



Chapter 26.


A low, rumbling voice sharply pierced her ears.

 

Lisbell nodded with trepidation. A faint chuckle slipped from his lips and fell to her face.

 

“If that’s what you want.”

 

Without hesitation, Ulrich, who had made it clear this was all foreplay for her sake, lifted her skirt. At his brazen gesture, Lisbell inhaled sharply.

 

“Move your arm.”

 



 

“If you do something distasteful one more time, I’ll make sure your breasts are so swollen by tomorrow they pop out of your clothes.”

 

At this chilling warning, Lisbell swallowed the saliva pooling in her mouth and reluctantly lowered her arm. Her vision, blurred with moisture, reflected the man’s image. As she blinked against the stinging of her eyelids, a tear traced down her cheek.

 

Only then did the man’s face, slightly harder than his voice, become clear. His evident displeasure gripped and shook her heart. Even then, Ulrich’s hands steadily worked, removing the underwear concealed beneath her skirt.

 

“You’re wearing so many things.”

 

He grumbled in annoyance, tossing the garments entwining her limbs onto the bed. Then he spread her legs wide. The unsettling clarity of his eyes, now seemingly focused on a tiny spot that had possibly just appeared, made her shudder.

 

His fingers brushed and rubbed against her vulva. Lisbell curled up like a wary animal.

 

“Even here, it’s so small.”

 

“…uh…”

 

“Still, it’s cute. Not a single blemish…”

 

Saying it was pinker than her nipples, he pushed aside the clitoral hood like a cover. As he rubbed the soft flesh, he suddenly slipped his fingers inside. It was a direct friction at the entrance.

 

With just one knuckle in, the dry flesh contracted, expressing mild pain.

 

Lisbell bit her lip. She couldn’t believe a stranger, someone other than her fiancé Theodore, was touching a place even he had never touched. She vaguely lamented her situation, wondering how it had come to this, when the sound of rustling fabric reached her ears.

 

Thump.

 

Something pressed firmly against the entrance. The dizzying contact caused her head to drop involuntarily.

 

Oh, a faint moan escaped Lisbell’s lips.

 

Before she knew it, Ulrich had opened his trousers and pulled out his erect cock, fixing his gaze on her vulva before looking up. Seeing her shocked expression, he smiled gently.

 

“Yes, I’m circumcised.”

 



 

“Is it that fascinating? You can’t take your eyes off it.”

 

Lisbell’s shock wasn’t due to this unexpected characteristic.

 

Though his smooth, hairless genitalia were surprising, what truly stunned her was the size. She couldn’t imagine anyone jokingly agreeing to take it.

 

Just brushing it with her palm revealed an unusual bulk. The engorged veins and its impressive length, striking her navel, were formidable. It was a weapon that didn’t suit his handsome face.

 

“Now I’m going to insert it, so stop looking. It’s time to focus below.”

 

“uh…!”

 

Suddenly, he spread her lower parts. Her virgin entrance, tightly closed, resisted the invasive force, contracting tightly.

 

Ulrich frowned slightly at the strong grip that seemed like it could snap off his glans. Despite her intense clenching, her flesh persistently clung to his skin, showing a fierce determination to adapt to intercourse with a man.

 

“Sorry, but I’m in a hurry.”

 

“uh, ah!”

 

With a cursory apology, Ulrich thrust his length in all at once.

 

Shhhlk. The tight, wet space expanded excessively.

 

Lisbell’s eyes filled with tears.

 

Her insides felt squeezed and twisted. Her internal systems, normally unbothered, were in chaos, delivering immense pressure. The pain was a bonus. It felt like she was being torn apart. The burning, stinging sensation was unbearable. Tears flowed uncontrollably.

 

“Ah, ah… uh…!”

 

“You’re not that wet… but, after a few thrusts… it’ll get wet on its own.”

 

His voice, strained between quick breaths, sounded rough. Consumed by excitement, he showed no concern for Lisbell’s state, beginning to thrust his hips.

 

“Ack! Wait… uh, ahh…!”

 

Her pained moans rolled off her tongue. Lisbell struggled like a person desperate to survive. Each deep thrust felt like a harpoon piercing her body.

 

She had never experienced such intimate, delicate agony.

 

It felt like her insides, not the outside, were being damaged.

 

It felt like her body was splitting in half. Lisbell tried to close her legs in a desperate effort, but he stopped her. With her legs hooked over his arms, Ulrich slammed deep into her.

 

“I told you…”

 

“uh, ahi Ah…!”

 

“I said I’d suck your breasts…”

 

His voice, hoarse and low, was scolding. He seemed to be blaming her for rushing him to penetrate instead of continuing the foreplay.

 

But Lisbell barely heard any of it. She was too busy trying to steady her breath, feeling as if she might die.

 

What was this?

 

How could such an act exist in the world? Wasn’t this torture? She had heard that sex was meant to be a pleasure between a man and a woman, but that was a lie. This was a nightmare. It was like experiencing hell while still alive.

 

“Ah…! uh…!”

 

“You’re so tight.”

 

Unlike Lisbell, who was in agony, Ulrich groaned in pleasure, enjoying the tight friction. His hand slid down to cup her hollowed-out knee. Leaning his body close, he bent her legs gently, thrusting his hips obscenely.

 

Squelch, squelchi 

 

His smooth shaft moved in and out, tearing her apart. It was like a white serpent eating through flesh. As a result, Lisbell’s vagina, stretched wide, was already red and swollen.

 

“Why don’t you relax? What’s the point of showing off your strength here?”

 

“uh, ah…! uh…”

 

When he lightly smacked her ass, her entire inner wall shook. The penis lodged inside twitched in response. Its suction was incredible. Clinging tightly, her flesh seemed to devour every bit of his vitality.

 

Whenever she let go and fully received that sensation, a melting pleasure pierced her brain.

 

Ulrich showed no mercy, piston-thrusting in and out. The speed gradually increased until the sound of his thrusts against her perineum echoed like relentless, cruel blows.

 

Lisbell curled up each time, feeling like she was truly being whipped. Sometimes her mind would go numb. Her belly felt unbearably hot, as if she’d swallowed fire, and the constantly opening and closing entrance seemed about to fall out. The sensation was shocking. That was all she could think.

 

Clearly experienced, Ulrich skillfully rotated his hips, driving his penis deep. He lowered his head, looking down at her pubic mound, slightly hairy, where her small hole was struggling to swallow his length. Feeling a pang of sympathy, he let his spit dribble down, spreading it with shallow thrusts, stirring her sticky insides.

 

It was firm enough to feel constriction, yet not entirely unpleasant.

 

And most importantly…

 

“You haven’t even done this with your fiancé, right?”

 

“uh, Ah…!”

 

“Then, is this… your first night with someone?”

 

Lisbell opened her eyes dazedly. Her body kept jerking uncomfortably. Her crotch was constantly being rubbed, and the tender flesh throbbed from the unending penetration.

 

She felt like her stomach was being raked with claws as she looked up at Ulrich, who was smiling. It was the grin of a devil.

 

“If that’s true, then…”

 

“uh, Ah…!”

 

“Shouldn’t we… be the ones getting married?”

 

His low, spreading laughter was filled with mockery.

 

Unable to hold back, Lisbell let her tears flow.



Chapter 27.


“Continuous thrust seemed to have loosened up your inner walls a bit compared to earlier.”

 

“Uh… Ah! Ahh! ! Hah!”

 

Catching his breath, he grabbed Lisbell’s ankles again and deftly plunged inside her. The massive, swollen object throbbed as it entered, hitting deep within her walls.

 

Whami It felt like being punched. Lisbell’s buttocks clenched hard as evidence. Ulrich thoroughly pinned her down and rapidly moved in and out of the narrow passage. Each time his swollen flesh pounded and squelched inside, her limbs and body shuddered. It was an act that truly controlled her entire being.

 

The robust penis moved in and out incessantly, raising the hot, embarrassing heat. Lisbell, now short of breath, lifted her chin and contracted below her navel.

 

Amidst the overwhelming pain, there was a faint sense of arousal. But the pain still dominated. Lisbell’s eyes, now out of focus, wandered in the air. Ulrich kissed her half-dazed mouth.

 

Their bodies stuck together, racing toward the peak.

 

His forearm-sized cock relentlessly pumped below, creating obscene sounds all around. The once tight and constricting inside gradually loosened under the relentless thrusting.

 

Soon, he filled her mouth with his tongue and climaxed. The semen, which he hadn’t released alone for a long time, poured out thickly. Their joined lower bodies became soaked without any chance to hold back.

 

As if regretful, he continued to move his hips, stimulating below even while ejaculating. The creamy fluid, tinged with light crimson, oozed out as his flesh invaded every intimate corner. The distinct, acrid smell of blood lingered somewhere.

 

“Huh… Hah.”

 

The pent-up breath finally burst out of her mouth.

 

It was over.

 

Finally, it was over.

 

Lisbell, her mind in shambles like a collapsed ruin, grabbed the sheets with trembling hands.

 

As he slowly lifted his torso, having stayed inside for quite a while, he barely moved in time. Her clothes were already torn and disheveled, just barely clinging to her body rather than being worn.

 

She suddenly tensed her buttocks and flinched.

 

She felt something trickling down from her sore, swollen opening. It burned and stung, clearly indicating tears without needing to check. It had been an excruciating time.

 

But at least… it was over.

 

Lisbell thought she had endured well, fighting the urge to vomit, as she wriggled out from under him.

 

“What are you doing?”

 

“Ah…!”

 

But just before she could completely pull away, her ankle was seized, dragging her back to her original position. The shadow as dark as ash seemed to engulf her. Lisbell looked up in confusion.

 

Unlike her, laid bare like an open gift box, Ulrich hadn’t removed a single piece of clothing during the entire sex. Now, he was loosening the tie around his neck.

 

“It’s over, right…?”

 

“Over?”

 

Ulrich sneered as he pulled out the tie.

 

“Who said so?”

 

His voice was harsh.

 

No, his voice was still as smooth as silk. The intention conveyed to Lisbell within it was insidious.

 

In the sudden jolt of despair, Lisbell froze like an ice statue and slowly shook her head.

 

“Once… once was enough.”

 

In a desperate plea, she managed to utter, but he only chuckled as he began unbuttoning his shirt one by one. The image of his half-naked body at the pool, basking in the sun and radiating sensual allure, flashed before her eyes.

 

Fear and confusion pooled at the edge of her reason. Tears, which she had forgotten in her pain, welled up again.

 

“I thought… it was just once, and it’s over…”

 

“Ha, where do you get such cute ideas?”

 

The mockery was clear.

 

Do I have to go through this again?

 

Do I have to endure this countless times?

 

Panic washed over her.

 

The act was so shocking that her consciousness seemed on the verge of breaking. The mere experience of being taken by a man she had never imagined a future with made her feel as if the world had collapsed. It was the first time she endured for the sake of her mother.

 

Lisbell knew she couldn’t handle the repeated torment. But when she lifted her tearful face and met his eyes, she realized it was a forlorn hope.

 

Ulrich was smiling.

 

A dangerously beautiful smile that could devour her in an instant. His eyes, gleaming with excessive lust, were the most frightening. They were eyes that couldn’t be reasoned with.

 

The warning lights in her head flared.

 

Lisbell, forgetting her aching body, hurriedly moved her limbs. But before she could escape the bed, her hair was seized.

 

“Ah!”

 

The pain felt like her scalp was tearing, bringing tears to her eyes. Her fragile body swayed before collapsing onto the sheets. The familiar weight pinned her down, making her nauseous.

 

Feeling the churning in her stomach, Lisbell struggled frantically. She didn’t know what she was saying, only that she was begging to be released.

 

“Keep your mouth shut, don’t spoil the mood.”

 

“Huh, huh… No, no…!”

 

“I’m in a really good mood after such a long time, you know?”

 

Her delicate legs bore the imprint of his grip. Matching those marks, Ulrich resumed his earlier brutal actions. The unexpected resistance made him click his tongue in annoyance.

 

Glaring menacingly for a moment, he calmly moved his hands like a predator targeting its prey.

 

“Huh…!”

 

A perilous gasp escaped Lisbell’s mouth.

 

She instinctively shook her head, only to choke herself further. Her limbs froze as she realized that Ulrich had tied her neck to the bedpost with the very black tie she had gifted him.

 

The more she thrashed, the tighter the tie constricted her airway. The thought that her life was in jeopardy made her hesitant, her hand movements faltering.

 

“… It’s suffocating, isn’t it?”

 

Ulrich looked down at her trembling body, pressing her knees together. The swollen entrance, unable to handle the thick shaft, had torn, spilling out semen tinged with light crimson.

 

“I mean… Hah…”

 

“Huh, huh…!”

 

Despite everything, her inner walls secreted some lubrication, making his glans slick. He rubbed it against her wet entrance before slowly inserting it. The flesh entered more smoothly than before, aided by the slickness of the expelled semen.

 

Watching the penetration with intense eyes, he inhaled deeply and thrust hard, as if to scramble her insides.

 

Lisbell’s body twisted in response. He pinned her hands to the sheets, interlocking their fingers in a tender yet cruel bind.

 

“Stay still.”

 

“Huh, huh…”

 

“Unless you want to choke to death…”

 

Her legs, spread wide around his sturdy body, trembled and turned pale. Each spasm made her insides grip him tighter.

 

Ulrich let out a satisfied groan. His breaths, soft and sweet, filled the room with the obscene sounds of flesh slapping against flesh. Beneath it, Lisbell’s sobs of despair softly echoed.


Chapter 28.


It hurts.

 

The first thought that came to mind as she woke up was that. Lisbell huddled her shoulders and let out a small cough. Her whole body ached and shivered as if she was about to come down with a severe fever. She lifted her unusually heavy eyelids to find herself in an unfamiliar environment.

 

“Gasp…!”

 

It didn’t take long for her to realize where she was and what had happened the previous day.

 

Lisbell hurriedly sat up and stifled a silent scream. Her arms, legs, shoulders, waist—there wasn’t a single part of her that didn’t ache. Especially her lower back, which made her dread the idea of sitting down for the rest of the day.

 

“uh….”

 

She barely held back a groan and turned to look behind her.

 

And once again, she had to stifle a silent scream.

 

The man who had seemed like a living devil last night was now sleeping with an angelic face.

 

He didn’t wake up even with her movement; his breathing was calm as he lay there.

 

Lisbell, her face pale with fear, watched him for a moment before quietly getting out of bed. She couldn’t suppress a painful groan as she moved, but the thought that he might wake up made her forcefully swallow the sound. As soon as she tightened her vocal cords for his sake, a sharp pain hit her.

 

Her whole body felt like a wreck.

 

Realizing she was naked, Lisbell quietly got out of bed to find her clothes. She stiffened as she felt a liquid trickling down between her legs.

 

She didn’t need to look to confirm it. She didn’t want to. It would only make the memories of last night more vivid.

 

Lisbell looked around and found her clothes scattered around. She picked them up and sneaked towards the bathroom attached to the bedroom.

 

“…Ah….”

 

A lost sigh escaped her lips.

 

Her reflection in the mirror was worse than she had imagined. Her face was swollen from the tears she had shed all night.

 

But what caught her attention more was her neck. It was bruised and discolored from being choked and rubbed by a tie all night. The pain she felt when she swallowed might have been from these wounds.

 

“uh….”

 

As soon as she touched her neck, pain shot through her. Lisbell blankly stared at the bruises encircling her neck before she slumped to the floor. Even though the ordeal was over and it was now morning, her heart still pounded. The pain left on her body caused these dreadful aftershocks.

 

Don’t think about it, don’t think about it….

 

It’s over now.

 

There’s no need to think about it anymore.

 

Last night, she secured a promise of mercy in exchange for her ordeal. She would resolve her mother’s issues and return to Misley, where Theodore was.

 

Then she could live as if nothing had happened.

 

That’s how it should be….

 

Even though her life could never be the same, at least she hadn’t suffered to an unbearable extent….

 

A wry smile formed. She knew better than anyone that repeating these words to herself in a corner was a poor consolation.

 

But regret was futile. She had ultimately betrayed her trust with Theodore. It was a path she chose herself. Even regret was deceitful.

 

Her eyelids stung. Tears welled up again from the accumulating thoughts. Lisbell wiped her tears with the back of her hand and quickly turned on the faucet.

 

She hastily cleaned herself under the running water. It would have been nice if everything could just wash away, but it wasn’t that simple. Struggling for a while, Lisbell eventually used her hand to part her buttock and push down on her lower abdomen. Only then did the thick semen start to slip out. It felt horribly disgusting, like expelling something abnormal.

 

Seeing herself in the mirror like this, a wave of humiliation hit her. Fresh tears welled up, but the gushing water hid them. Under the warm water, Lisbell rubbed her eyes repeatedly.

 

After hastily washing herself as if someone were chasing her, she quickly dried off and put on the clothes she had brought. The memory of the letter of mercy Ulrich had neatly signed yesterday came to mind as she buttoned her blouse.

 

Yesterday, definitely….

 

It was in the third drawer.

 

She had endured all that just to get it.

 

Lisbell left the bathroom and approached the desk. Glancing at the bed, she saw Ulrich still sleeping peacefully.

 

Click.

 

She opened the third drawer. Contrary to her expectations, it was empty. Her hand on the drawer handle froze in confusion.

 

She was sure he had put it there yesterday.

 

Was it not here?

 

Feeling bewildered, she hurriedly opened all the drawers above. But they were all empty. No matter how hard she searched, she couldn’t find what she was looking for.

 

It was then.

 

“Pfft.”

 

A chill ran down her spine.

 

Lisbell froze in place and slowly turned her head. Ulrich, who had been sound asleep just moments ago, was now awake and looking at her. Still lying comfortably, his arm draped over his forehead, he looked at her with languid eyes, as if enjoying the morning.

 

“Stealthily.”

 



 

“You’re moving like a cat again today.”

 



 

“I didn’t see a cute tail last night, though….”

 

Ulrich yawned lightly, making nonsensical comments.

 

Lisbell, crouched in front of the drawer, couldn’t move. The air had turned sharp from the moment he laughed, but seeing the carefree man, it seemed only her air had stiffened.

 

A weak nausea rose inside her. The reason he could be so relaxed after such a degrading night… could only be because he had experienced many such nights before.

 

“It’s not there.”

 



 

“I moved it, of course.”

 

Ulrich, slowly stretching his neck side to side, spoke quietly. Unlike her, who had been frantically covering herself and heading to the bathroom, he unabashedly displayed his naked body without a hint of shame.

 

Lisbell quickly turned her head away. When she had seen him at the swimming pool before, she couldn’t find a place to look. Now, she turned away because she feared the memories of last night would resurface.

 

Ignoring her reaction, he put on a robe from the wing chair. Tying the belt loosely, he barely covered himself and approached the desk where Lisbell was sitting with a cigarette in his mouth.

 

“I figured you’d look for it first thing with red eyes.”

 

“…Isn’t your business with me finished?”

 

“Did you sleep well?”

 

“Ulrich.”

 

“Aren’t you hungry?”

 



 

“Let’s go down for breakfast.”

 

Am I talking to a person or a wall? 

 

Lisbell glared at Ulrich, who shamelessly ignored her words.

 

He, standing right in front of her, slowly bent his knees and squatted down.

 

“Oh dear.”

 

With a cigarette in his mouth, he clicked his tongue as he reached out to touch her neck.

 

“Your pretty neck is a mess.”

 



 

“Sorry. I tend to lose sight of everything when I get excited.”

 

His approaching hand looked like a dark abyss. Reflexively, Lisbell slapped it away. The sound echoed through the spacious bedroom, breaking the silence and making the air feel sharp.

 

Lisbell was more surprised by her actions than anyone else.

 

She had never treated anyone like this before, making her own reaction unfamiliar and causing her to resent Ulrich for making her feel this way.

 

She bit her lip and then let go.

 

“I’m fine…I don’t need breakfast”

 



 

“Please give me the letter of mercy.”

 



 

“It’s really over now. I just want to go back to Misley. Please.”

 

She wanted to shout and demand it right away, but she didn’t have the letter in her possession yet. As long as it was in Ulrich’s hands, she had to be compliant. Given his unpredictable behavior, who knew what bizarre act he might commit if his mood soured.

 

Ulrich, looking down at his slapped hand, smiled.

 

Lisbell, avoiding his eyes, flinched when he suddenly grabbed her chin firmly. His face drew close, startling her.

 

“I said, let’s have breakfast first.”

 



 

“Don’t make me repeat myself. I really hate that.”



Chapter 29.


It was not a force that could be escaped by sheer will alone. Even without the problem of physical strength, Lisbell could not refuse this touch. The mockery, with the letter of mercy as its price, continued from night into the morning.

 

Lisbell looked at the man with tearful eyes. His formerly indifferent expression softened, and he released her slender jaw. The same hand that had forcibly spread her legs many times yesterday gently caressed her cheek.

 

“I’ll give it to you after breakfast.”

 



 

“Come down with me.”

 

Without waiting for a response, Ulrich got up and headed for the door. Lisbell, who had been sitting listlessly like she did in the reception room, finally pushed herself up from the floor after a delay.

 

Her legs trembled. Her whole body felt as if it had been bitten by a beast, and she was overcome with a slight nausea. The thought of having to eat in front of this man only made her symptoms worse.

 

But she couldn’t give up the letter of mercy, so she quietly followed him. As they descended the stairs, she became acutely aware of the dire state of her body. The thought of returning to Misley in this condition felt overwhelming.

 

The dining room was absurdly large for a space meant for just one person. Lisbell sat beside Ulrich, who took the head seat. As soon as they were seated, a servant, who seemed to be a long-time employee like a mother, quietly served the meal.

 

Lisbell stared at Ulrich without touching her food. He noticed her gaze as he took a sip of coffee to wake himself up and smirked.

 

After calling a servant and giving instructions that Lisbell couldn’t hear, the door to the dining room opened, and Victor appeared.

 

“I brought what you asked for.”

 

Victor placed the paper in front of him. Lisbell immediately recognized it as the letter of mercy she had been desperately searching for since morning. As she watched it, Victor leaned over and whispered in Ulrich’s ear.

 

“And she just returned.”

 

“Really?”

 

“What should I do?”

 

“What else? She should report immediately.”

 

Ulrich laughed softly as he noticed her lack of interest. He motioned for Victor to come closer again and whispered more instructions. Victor glanced at Lisbell, sighed, and nodded.

 

After the secretary left, Ulrich picked up his glass.

 

“Eat something. You haven’t had a proper meal since last night.”

 

He pointed at Lisbell’s untouched plate. His apparent concern was infuriating. He was the one who had robbed her of her appetite.

 

“I’m not hungry.”

 

“Why not?”

 

The man who knew better than anyone else still asked. It became clear that his question was a command.

 

Lisbell reluctantly picked up her fork. She speared a grilled mushroom, which looked easy to swallow, and pushed it into her mouth. The mushroom’s unique flavor spread, but her nausea persisted.

 

Forcing down a few bites, Victor returned. He placed the items he brought beside Ulrich and left. One was Lisbell’s luggage, left in the reception room yesterday, and the other was a neat white scarf.

 

After placing the luggage under her chair, Ulrich unfolded the scarf. He reached out to Lisbell.

 

Startled, her eyes met his cold, sharp gaze. It was a silent warning. If she swatted his hand away like before, he wouldn’t let it slide. So, she didn’t move as he tied the scarf around her neck.

 

Her hand holding the fork trembled. Memories of yesterday flooded back. What if he choked her with this scarf like he did with the tie last night?

 

While she struggled to calm her shaking mind, Ulrich’s hand withdrew. The scarf hid the bruises on her neck. Lisbell touched the scarf with a bitter expression.

 

“Why…”

 

“Hmm?”

 



 

“Oh.”

 

He answered with a smile in his eyes.

 

“Because I thought you’d want to cover it?”

 

Cover what? From whom?

 

Puzzled, Lisbell stared at him.

 

Knock, knock. The sound of someone knocking broke the silence.

 

“Come in,” Ulrich said in his characteristic low voice. Lisbell’s gaze turned involuntarily towards the door.

 

And then.

 

And then….

 

“Motheri”

 

Mrs. Osborne stood there.

 

She paused, surprised to hear her daughter call her. Her expression showed she had no idea why Lisbell was there.

 

Before the mother and daughter could speak, Ulrich intervened.

 

“Madam, did you have a good trip?”

 

“Yes, sir. I completed the errand you assigned and returned. But why is Lisbell here…?”

 

What?

 

Lisbell couldn’t believe her ears.

 

Errand? Completed? Returned? What is this all about?

 

A dreadful thought briefly crossed her mind.

 

Surely not…

 

No way.

 

To resolve this absurdity, Lisbell looked at him. Ulrich was smiling handsomely as usual. He addressed Mrs. Osborne while looking at Lisbell leisurely.

 

“Lisbell said she had left something at the villa. Since you were away, I received her in your stead.”

 

“My daughter must have been a bother.”

 

“Not at all.”

 

Lisbell froze amidst their casual conversation. The reality of the situation dawned on her. Yet, it was too unbelievable to speak.

 

If what I think is true…

 

Then what have I….

 

“Madam, have you eaten?”

 

“Yes, I had a simple meal on the way back.”

 

“Then you should unpack first.”

 

Mrs. Osborne read the subtle hint to leave and bowed. Her gaze met her daughter’s across the table.

 

Sadly, their eyes did not connect. Lisbell only stared at the man beside her.

 

“I’ll be back soon. Lisbell, wait a bit, okay?”

 

“Don’t worry about Lisbell. I’ll take good care of her.”

 

“Thank you.”

 

She left the dining room, knowing nothing.

 

Lisbell regained her senses after her mother exited. She looked back at the door her mother had just gone through. The questions she hadn’t asked came pouring out.

 

Mother, why are you here?

 

I thought you were under house arrest. How are you moving freely?

 

And why do you greet this man so casually?

 

I knelt and cried, begging this man more desperately than anyone. How could you….

 

“Didn’t I tell you before?”

 



 

“That being a teacher doesn’t suit you, Lisbell.”

 

Lisbell’s head turned awkwardly towards him.

 

Ulrich stabbed a cherry tomato on his plate with a fork. The fruit burst, splattering red juice everywhere. He seemed to be toying with it rather than eating it.

 

Their eyes met.

 

Cutting the almost-squashed tomato in half, he spoke.

 

“You’re too naive…”

 

Lisbell suddenly stood up.

 

Her chair fell back with a thud. Her luggage toppled over as well. Everything was a mess, but Lisbell knew for sure. The biggest mess here was herself.

 

“How…”

 

Her voice trembled as if her vocal cords were being twisted.

 

“How could you do this…”

 

She didn’t know what tricks he had used, but one thing was clear. The whole thing was a lie. The theft accusation against her mother was fabricated.

 

Which means I begged this man pitifully for something that never happened. Worse, I betrayed my fiancé and ended up with this man….

 

“uh…”

 

Lisbell felt genuinely sick and staggered. She couldn’t hold onto the table and collapsed. Her mind boiled with anger, frustration, and helplessness. The shameful, hateful night left a deep scar on her heart.


Chapter 30.


Her body sharply honed senses heightened her awareness.

 

The stinging feeling when she swallowed, the lingering discomfort as if something remained inside whenever she moved his lower body… the marks that clung to her body could not be easily washed away with water. Like an indelible brand that couldn’t be removed no matter what she did.

 

“…Let goi”

 

That’s why Lisbell furiously shook off Ulrich’s grip on her wrist. His expression once again bore a sharp warning, but Lisbell, her emotions equally intense, paid no attention to it.

 

Ulrich stared impassively at Lisbell, who was glaring at him furiously. Even the customary smile he usually wore was absent. Lisbell thought that perhaps this was his true face. The gap between when he smiled and when he didn’t was so vast.

 

“You looked pretty when you were crying in bed.”

 



 

“Not at all now, though.”

 

Ulrich whispered in a complaining tone, making a light gesture. Something fluttered and fell into Lisbell’s arms. It was a letter of Mercy that he tossed at her.

 

“Here, take it.”

 



 

“You spread your legs for it, so stop glaring at me.”

 

As she looked at the letter that brushed past her chest and fell to the floor, Lisbell let out a dry laugh.

 

What use is it now?

 

The letter was necessary to save her mother. Yet, the mother who appeared before her was perfectly fine, not hindered in any way. She was not treated as a criminal and was still serving excellently as an employee of this mansion.

 

In other words, the theft incident that had flown to Misley via mail never happened. Therefore, even this letter of Mercy was utterly useless to Lisbell. The black letters on the white background seemed to mock her.

 

Lisbell steadied herself, pressing her trembling hands on the floor, and stood up. She placed the crumpled letter conspicuously on the dining table and picked up her fallen luggage.

 

Even now, her body, which had endured an ordeal all night, creaked and screamed in pain. She stifled a groan, clenching her teeth, and turned her back.

 

There was no reason to stay any longer. More precisely, she didn’t want to be in the same space as this man. The only reason she faced the man she didn’t want to see was to get the letter of Mercy. Now that it was all useless… there was no reason to endure the disgust any longer.

 

To be honest, she had many things she wanted to argue about.

 

She was unfairly treated and felt indignant.

 

She felt like crying out of frustration.

 

But… would anything really be resolved by venting those feelings?

 

She had already lost her purity, it was her choice, and this man was still Altahart.

 

Look, what could have made the non-existent incident seem so real?

 

It was the power he held.

 

A family known to manipulate the capital’s press at will would easily handle the local government like the tongue in their mouth.

 

Could she possibly compete with such a person?

 

If she tried to escalate the issue, nothing would be resolved. Reality was always harsher than dreams. Hence, Lisbell turned without saying a word.

 

She just wanted to return to Misley as soon as possible. She wanted to see Theodore’s face, be held in his broad arms, and be reassured that such an incident would not affect her life or future. Staying here, with this man, might drive her crazy first.

 

“Will you tell your mother?”

 

As she headed toward the door, a voice coiled around her ankle like a snake slithering through the bushes.

 

Lisbell doubted his humanity, mentioning her mother even at the last moment. She once considered him not a bad person. With a bitter smile, she just turned her head.

 

“…Do you still want to act like a benevolent master?”

 

So now, was he trying to silence her?

 

Why bother?

 

Did he like her mother as a subordinate that much? But could such a valuable subordinate be used in such a lowly manner? Perhaps he had a different standard for handling people, one that didn’t adhere to common sense. He might not feel any guilt using people as tools.

 

“Who?”

 



 

“Me?”

 

Her guess wavered. Ulrich’s reaction, as if asking what nonsense she was spouting, confused her.

 

“What do I care about how the subordinates see me?”

 



 

“I’m just curious. Whether Lisbell will talk or not.”

 



 

“Probably not.”

 

Lisbell clenched her fist. She felt her nails dig into her flesh but didn’t relax her grip.

 

She wanted to refute him, but unfortunately, even she couldn’t easily conclude. Her mother was unexpectedly fine and had seen her suddenly appear in Marnia. So, naturally, she would need to explain everything. She would likely ask what she left behind that made her come back.

 

Then there was another crossroads.

 

She could tell her mother everything or hide it.

 

In fact, until she put down the letter of Mercy, she intended to tell everything. Because she had clearly witnessed Ulrich’s disgusting nature. She was genuinely concerned about her mother living with such a vile person.

 

So, she planned to confess and persuade her to quit.

 

But….

 

“Why… do you think that?”

 

“Will you do it?”

 



 

“No, you can’t.”

 

Ulrich never resolved curiosity all at once. What she previously saw as polished manners now seemed like mere vile hobbies.

 

“You can’t do it.”

 

“So…i”

 

“A kind-hearted daughter like Lisbell couldn’t do that, could she?”

 



 

“Could you tell your mother that you were raped by another man while you had a fiancé?”

 

He laughed heartily, as if even saying it was ridiculous. His platinum hair, shaking along with his tilted head, reminded her of a spider web catching the sunlight. Her limbs stiffened as if tied up, helpless.

 

The word he uttered, the sentence it formed, the blatant intention beneath it… the overt mockery.

 

Everything gnawed at Lisbell.

 

Only when the taste of blood spread in her mouth did she realize she had bitten the inside of her cheek hard. And that it reflected her inner state accurately.

 

The situation and her position were strange. When it came to causality, she was clearly the victim. She was forced to give herself to Ulrich Altahart, who blackmailed her using her mother’s false safety.

 

Then why was she so anxious and uneasy?

 

Why was she… while this man brazenly held his head high….

 

“I will tell her.”

 



 

“Everything, everything….”

 

Her trembling voice was wet. No matter how hard she tried to force strength into her throat, she couldn’t shake off the dampness. Ulrich, noticing the sob in her voice, smiled pityingly. Twisted as her feelings were, even that smile felt like mockery.

 

“Really?”

 



 

“Then go ahead.”

 

Ulrich calmly smoothed his unstyled hair and opened a gold-framed case next to a tall candlestick. He took out a cigarette, his actions devoid of any embarrassment or similar emotion.

 

Even her declaration to reveal everything didn’t faze him; he remained composed as if it were someone else’s business.

 

“Only Mrs. Osborne will be pitiful.”

 

He was not just composed… he seemed indifferent.

 

Only then did Lisbell realize that to him, last night’s events were merely a trivial joke. And that the aftermath of it didn’t matter to him at all, as if it were a non-issue.

 

Unlike Lisbell, whose inner self was breaking, he was still and would always be the untarnished Altahart.

 

Those pretty eyes.

 

Those pretty yet repulsive eyes.

 

Those eyes spread out like an endless sea….

 

Unable to endure any longer, Lisbell ran out of the dining room.


Chapter 31 .


Lisbell ran down the hallway without stopping, like someone who only saw what was in front of them. Today, the unusually quiet and eerie mansion resonated only with the sound of her heavy footsteps. She broke into a cold sweat as if she was running toward a destination that would never come. By the time she barely escaped the mansion and crossed the garden, her vision was already soaked. Tears blurred her eyes, soaking her cheeks every time she blinked. She raised her arm and roughly wiped her face.

 

“Lisbelli”

 

She halted abruptly, as if her roots were planted in the ground. In a landscape she could no longer see, a familiar voice that brought peace stopped her in her tracks. She stood there, staring down at her shadow stretching across the ground.

 

Soon, someone grabbed her shoulder and turned her around.

 

“Lisbell, dear.”

 

“…Mother.”

 

“Oh dear, what’s happened to your face….”

 

Mrs. Osborne was at a loss for words upon seeing her daughter’s disheveled and tear-streaked face. Her dry fingers touched Lisbell’s pale cheek.

 

“What happened, dear?”

 

Mrs. Osborne, who had rarely seen her daughter in such a state, was quite alarmed. She had just unpacked at the servants’ quarters and was on her way back to the main mansion. If she hadn’t accidentally seen her daughter running out of the mansion like a panicked person, she wouldn’t have had this chance to catch her.

 

“Stop crying… and calmly tell me what happened. You said you came here because you forgot something.”

 

Hearing her mother’s gentle voice that seemed to wrap around her, Lisbell’s eyelids fluttered wearily. Undrying tears ran across her cheeks.

 

The worried expression, the anxious voice, and the warm, affectionate touch of her mother made Lisbell struggle to move her tongue.

 

“Mother.”

 

“Yes.”

 

“I have a favor to ask.”

 

“A favor?”

 

“Please stop working at this mansion.”

 

Oh, Lisbell sighed inwardly.

 

She couldn’t tell her mother about what happened last night, not even if it killed her. This might play out exactly as Ulrich had predicted, but it wasn’t a matter of pride.

 

“What?”

 

“Please.”

 



 

“I’m begging you.”

 

“What’s this all of a sudden….”

 

“Any other job is fine. You don’t have to move to another country with me. But not here. Anywhere but here.”

 

Mrs. Osborne’s wavering expression turned sharp for a moment.

 

“Did something happen with the master?”

 

Her mother’s fingers, which were holding her, twitched and curled. Lisbell looked down at that hand silently, then forced a smile after a long while.

 

“What happened…..”

 



 

“Just… staying here for a day, I got a bad impression of him. He seems to treat people rather carelessly. He may respect you for now, but who knows when his attitude might change.”

 



 

“So….”

 

She felt like an utter fool for not being able to say more, but she had no other choice.

 

“A kind-hearted daughter like Lisbell couldn’t do that, could she?”

 

“Could you tell your mother that you were raped by another man while you had a fiancé?”

 

She knew she must seem strange, and the situation unfolding as Ulrich had foreseen was excruciating, but none of that mattered compared to the pain her mother would feel if she learned the truth.

 

So ultimately, this matter was.

 

“Just this once, please listen to me.”

 

It’s something I must endure alone….

 



 

The weather turned hot.

 

The lush summer had arrived.

 

Since Marnia was a small town with many nature-friendly elements, the seasonal changes were more pronounced. The leaves, originally a fresh green, turned a vivid green under the sunlight, and the flowers blooming along the stems became vibrant and colorful.

 

“The construction of the Alstad Hotel’s second branch is now in its final stages. If everything proceeds as planned, it should be smooth. Once construction is completed, we will need to run a trial operation, so please provide a guest list for the trial run, and we will send out invitations accordingly.”

 

Thud.

 

Ulrich moved his bishop diagonally one square, pressing it with his index finger.

 

Victor, who was checking something on a document, suddenly grabbed a chess piece. With a mountain of work to deal with, even thinking about where to place the pieces made his brain feel overloaded.

 

But he had to comply quietly whenever he had the chance to keep Ulrich engaged in this way. It was a kind of custom boss management know-how he had developed after serving him for several years.

 

After Victor’s turn, it was Ulrich’s turn again. He crossed his legs and stared at the chessboard. His eyes, lost in thought, looked as if he was completely absorbed in the game. Victor doubted if he was even listening to the business report he was giving.

 

Despite his doubts, Victor continued his report.

 

“And regarding the Alstad Department Store, the shipping costs on the northern coast have recently increased abnormally, so we will inevitably need to adjust our support for delivery costs. However, since the adjustment will be uniform, we may face backlash from other suppliers.”

 



 

“Also, we have received the list of stores that will be newly contracted and opened. Gwen has initially reviewed it.”

 

“Why him?”

 

That guy, suddenly reacting.

 

Victor looked incredulous as he reached for a chess piece during his turn. Given the topic, he somewhat understood the sudden change in demeanor. If he had known he would react so well, he would have brought up Gwen Altahart’s topic from the start.

 

“Since the department store is jointly managed by both of you, it’s only natural to cross-check with him.”

 

“Joint management?”

 



 

“Who decided that?”

 

Ulrich lifted the queen, asking in a soft low voice. He fiddled with the well-defined chess piece, raising his eyebrow.

 

“Hasn’t he sent the written waiver of his shares yet?”

 

“No… not yet….”

 

Ulrich chuckled softly at Victor’s deflated response.

 

“My brother is more persistent than he seems.”

 



 

“He should learn to give up gracefully after losing a bet.”

 

“…You need to speak clearly. Don’t you know who made him act so petty?”

 

“You mean me?”

 

The answer was obvious, but the question was annoying. Victor looked like he wanted to thump his chest.

 

“Really, why did you spread rumors about Gwen’s personal life…i”

 

“He was going to pretend it never happened.”

 



 

“Gwen was the one who broke the brotherly bond first.”

 

Victor felt a throbbing headache and rubbed his face dryly.

 

It had been four years since he graduated from university and started working as an aide to this nobleman.

 

Victor Loisden first met him at university.

 

When he got into a prestigious university, known to be difficult for commoners, he felt like he had the world at his feet. But that feeling didn’t last even a month after enrollment.

 

He encountered a world he hadn’t known at university. Talented people who made him feel like a frog in a well, a grain of sand on the beach, simply by their presence.

 

In a world with a social hierarchy, ‘talent’ referred to those with noble lineage or those who, even without such noble status, had grown wealthy enough from profitable businesses to be respected by nobles.

 

Ulrich Altahart was at the top of that human pyramid. He had been since before any relationships or friendships formed. His last name, ‘Altahart,’ established his position.

 

Even now, it seemed he was destined for fame. Besides inheriting wealth from a lineage of international bankers, he had an extraordinary appearance.

 

His exceptional qualities, combined, made him a center of attention and admiration throughout university.

 

Victor got to know him through a shared class. They started talking because they sat close to each other, leading to the current situation.

 

Damni

 

Victor cursed himself for not running away back then.

 

Of course, being in this position was undoubtedly an honor. Without a noble title or bourgeois background, Victor Loisden was a florist’s son from a small village. Becoming a secretary for Altahart, the nation’s foremost banker, was a village-level event.

 

The problem wasn’t the position of secretary.

 

The problem was his employer.

 

He had noticed some unusual traits during university but had dismissed them. The salary offered with the secretary position was too significant to decline just because of personality.

Chapter 32 .

However, everything in this world comes at a cost.

 

Tasks that are given astronomical amounts of money have a reason for it.

 

From serving under his peer closely, Victor realized that not only Ulrich but his entire family was a den of madness.

 

Do the rich always play around like this?

 

Every time an incident occurred, he couldn’t help but think about how grand the scale was. The grotesqueness was a given, and sometimes it was accompanied by a repulsive discomfort.

 

In other words, they did not hide the obscene and blatant instincts underlying human consciousness. This seemed related to their family background… Perhaps because they could obtain anything easily from a young age, even the elements to alleviate their boredom were extraordinary. Drugs and gang rapes were trivial, so what more could be said?

 

Victor stopped pondering about their humanity. Perhaps it was right after he saw Ulrich mingling with a married woman in a lounge at a charity event hosted by the Iroo family.

 

The lady, with her slender legs wrapped around Ulrich’s waist and moaning loudly, was clearly the hostess of the Iroo family that hosted the event that day.

 

That wasn’t all. The entire family, including Ulrich, was completely depraved. They were devoted to corrupting the customs with all their might. Perhaps it was lucky that they had the power to control and manipulate the media, allowing them to hide such aspects.

 

“Should I sue him?”

 

“What?”

 

“It’s clearly a breach of contract. Don’t you think we could do it if we got a lawyer?”

 

Ulrich, as if he was about to reach for the phone, twitched his fingers resting on his knee. Victor covered his face with his hands, hoping he would refrain.

 

“So, are you planning to form a family lawyer team?”

 

“If possible.”

 

“And then sue Young Master Gwen? Do you think that makes sense?”

 

“Things that don’t make sense often do, when money is involved.”

 

Nothing about serving a nobleman was easy, but recently, the most troubling issue was this. The disputes between the Altahart brothers, who were always at each other’s throats since childhood, only intensified as they grew older.

 

The reason Ulrich ended up at the secluded Marnia villa was also related to this.

 

It started with a trivial bet.

 

The Altahart family’s business had diversified into several fields over time.

 

Under the leadership of the Altahart matriarch, who took over the international banking sector following her late husband, the two brothers each carved out their own business territories based on their interests and positions.

 

The eldest son, Gwen Altahart, who was set to become the head of the family, took control of the oil industry, which showed great potential following banking. Ulrich, on the other hand, took charge of the hotel business in the capital, which he had steadily developed since coming of age. Other sectors like the jewelry and wine industries were also divided under their names.

 

The only business they shared jointly was a department store in the capital.

 

The department store, with five floors built along the main street next to the square, boasted much higher profits than expected. It could leverage various family businesses, was useful for managing connections, and had a bright future.

 

The department store, which both brothers coveted, had not been clearly divided, and thus had been jointly operated. During this time, they relentlessly tore each other apart.

 

In Victor’s view, Ulrich was the more talented businessman. He had an instinctive sense of how to roll money to make it grow.

 

In contrast, Gwen, the eldest, was greedy but lacked skills. The profits from his projects were largely due to the inherent profitability of the business rather than his ability. If Ulrich had taken on those projects, the profit margins would have been at least twice as high.

 

Gwen wasn’t a particularly good manager. However, being an Altahart, he was also prideful. He had big dreams and was greedy.

 

Naturally, he interfered with the department store business frequently.

 

When problems arose due to his interference, he never reconsidered his decisions but instead blamed his subordinates. When frustrated, he would call in high-class prostitutes and lock himself in his bedroom for days, indulging in drugs and merrymaking.

 

Gwen was neither responsible nor thoughtful.

 

In contrast, Ulrich only interfered when necessary, and though he found everything a bother, he saw tasks through to the end. This wasn’t always the case; he seemed to find pleasure in watching money grow based on his decisions as he inherited more of the family’s business.

 

The bet over the department store management rights stemmed from such trivial disagreements.

 

“You crazy bastard… Ulrich, do you even think? The new tenants on the third floor must be the finest whiskey from the Hohen Kingdom. Are you going to stash that precious cash cow somewhere?”

 

“Gwen, did you plug your ears? We’re planning to clear out the store and turn it into a tea room. The construction schedule is already set, and we’re about to start. What nonsense are you talking about?”

 

“Tea room? Tea roooom? In a department store where people come to spend money? Do you want them to sit and listen to orchestras and laugh? Is this a party hall? Are you not planning to sell goods? It’s more profitable to increase tenants and salesi”

 

“Wanna bet?”

 

“What?”

 

“Whether the department store’s total sales will increase or decrease after the tea room is established.”

 

“Hah, look at this lunatic. Fine, let’s bet. I bet it will decrease.”

 

“I bet it will increase.”

 

“The deadline is three months after the construction.”

 

“Fine.”

 

“What will you give up if I win?”

 

“The management rights of the department store.”

 

“What?”

 

“I’m sick of this constant bickering. Let’s settle this once and for all. The loser steps back.”

 

“You short-sighted fool… Fine, let’s end thisi”

 

In the end, Ulrich was the winner.

 

The tea room, established in a department store with no suitable gathering place, became a new social hub for the upper class.

 

The upper class’s desire to show off could not be overlooked. People who used to visit the department store casually began to spruce up their appearance. They gathered in groups, eager to find something that made them stand out.

 

The most notable thing was the shopping list, of course.

 

People engaged in subtle competitions to show who had the deepest pockets by buying the most expensive items. As a result, the department store’s sales skyrocketed.

 

Thus, the department store became Ulrich’s.

 

At least, that’s what Ulrich and his secretary, Victor, thought.

 

The variable was Gwen.

 

Despite his loud declaration to settle things, Gwen played dumb when the results didn’t favor him. It was a cowardly stance, but since the promise was verbal, there was no tangible evidence.

 

But Ulrich didn’t back down easily. Every morning, the first thing he did was send a letter of renunciation of joint management rights to his brother’s bedroom. Gwen, of course, ignored him.

 

After more than twenty letters were ignored, Ulrich’s patience ran out.

 

“…Oh my god.”

 

One morning, Victor, while sipping strong coffee and reading the newspaper, spat out his drink.

 

What the…?

 

He couldn’t believe his eyes as coffee dripped from his lips.

 

Altahart’s eldest son. The heir of the family. Gwen Altahart. Homosexual. Prostitute. Male prostitute. Orgy. Drugs. Sex scandal. Engagement. Schwaben family.

 

All kinds of obscene and dirty words adorned the front page of the capital’s tabloids.

 

Naturally, the family was in an uproar.

 

Investing an enormous amount every quarter to manage the media was to ensure that such sordid personal lives were never exposed.

 

They had so tightly controlled the flow of information that not a hint of truth had ever leaked, maintaining an image of nobility and mystery. Despite the sordid reality, the Altaharts were revered as wealthy elites by the people of Rechem.

 

The perfect sandcastle they had built was now on the verge of collapsing.

 

Victor was particularly shocked.

 

It was only natural.

 

The one who had leaked this horrific scandal was his own boss, Ulrich.


Chapter 33.


As soon as Victor regained his senses, he was summoned to the mansion.

 

Dragged before his employer, Victor reported everything he knew. Meanwhile, Gwen Altahart crumpled up tabloid papers with his face plastered across them, cursing loudly, and their mother, Lady Altahart, rubbed her temples with an exasperated look.

 

“So, in the end…”

 



 

“Are you saying this mess all started from a bet?”

 

“Yes, ma’am…”

 

“Unbelievable, I’m at my wits’ end.”

 

Lady Altahart, the current head of the family, was at a loss for words at her two adult sons, behaving no better than seven-year-old children.

 

Gwen, seething with anger, shouted from the side.

 

“Motheri Please issue a summons for this wretch immediatelyi”

 

“Gwen, calm yourself.”

 

“How can I calm down? We’ve always maintained strict privacyi It’s a principle our family has upheld meticulously since our ancestors’ times. This rascal has gone too far. Such a disgraceful method is intolerable as an Altaharti”

 

“And is your behavior as the loser of the bet acceptable as an Altahart?”

 

“Motheri”

 

“Enough, keep your mouth shut. Right now, it’s not Ulrich tarnishing the Altahart name but your vulgar lust, shamelessly showing itself without regard for men or women.”

 

Lady Altahart sternly reprimanded her eldest son and sighed deeply. The young handsome man standing behind her cautiously patted her shoulder.

 

Gwen laughed at the sight. To criticize his preferences while his mother selected the most handsome men from the capital as her bedmates wasn’t much different.

 

“Victor.”

 

“Yes, ma’am.”

 

“You need to go to Ulrich.”

 

Ulrich had utterly shattered the family’s principle of secrecy and leisurely left the capital at dawn. It was a swift escape, anticipating this mess.

 

But then again, when hadn’t he been like that?

 

He was never in the present. Sometimes fearfully, sometimes tenaciously, he glimpsed beyond with meticulous precision.

 

Anyhow, the ensuing chaos continued to this day.

 

Victor found himself caught in the middle of this mess. The capital was demanding Ulrich’s return urgently, but his boss showed no intention of returning. Instead, he seemed to be settling in this place called Marnia, enjoying the tranquil days.

 

“This isn’t fun.”

 

Or maybe “enjoying” wasn’t the right word.

 

Checkmate.

 

Victor’s king was surrounded on the chessboard. Ulrich flicked the king over with a finger, toppling the surrounding pieces.

 

With a perfect visual victory, Ulrich lit a cigarette with a bored expression.

 

“What about the investigation I asked for?”

 

Victor sighed. This wasn’t the time to discuss such trivial matters, but it was better to appease him than to irritate him.

 

He retrieved some documents from a pile.

 

“You wanted information on Theodore Motier and his family.”

 

He found and handed over the desired paper. Ulrich, adjusting the cigarette in his mouth, flipped through it. Watching him read, Victor voiced his ongoing doubt.

 

“They run a small factory in the Renbruck industrial complex. Is there a problem with them?”

 

“They keep coming to mind.”

 

“Excuse me? What keeps coming to mind?”

 

Ulrich fell silent again.

 

Victor, accustomed to his unilateral silence, continued to search for any remaining reports.

 

“A textile factory?”

 

Ulrich, exhaling leisurely, muttered the words written on the paper.

 

“Yes? Ah, yes.”

 

“Is there a large farm in Renbruck?”

 

“There are fertile fields on the outskirts of the city. They contract with those farms to procure raw materials.”

 

Ulrich nodded faintly.

 

He continued reading with frightening concentration until more than half of his cigarette was gone.

 

Actually, with each line he read, different thoughts filled his mind.

 

“uh, uh…!”

 

“I thought it was just once, and it was all over….”

 

His thigh stung. He was so deep in thought he didn’t notice the cigarette ash falling on his leg. He just stared at the mark and muttered.

 

“It keeps coming to mind.”

 

“…What keeps coming to mind?”

 

It was petty revenge.

 

Repaying a rejection at the pavilion with a forcefully obtained one-night stand. He wouldn’t deny the underlying selfishness, but more vividly, it was the desire to restore his wounded pride.

 

Using Lady Osborne as a means, blackmailing her with maternal love, and indulging in the delicate body as he pleased for a night.

 

Ulrich felt no moral guilt from these actions. The injury she might suffer was nothing compared to his need to relieve his unpleasant mood.

 

All his relationships were like that. He valued his own emotional fluctuations more than a person’s life.

 

And he thought once was enough for such a ruthless solution. After resolving the irritation, he expected his peace to return.

 

But it kept…

 

“Her crying face was beautiful.”

 



 

“So it keeps coming to mind….”

 

Victor had a puzzled look, not understanding a word. Before he could ask more, there was a knock on the closed door. After a brief wait, Lady Osborne appeared.

 

“I brought new refreshments.”

 

“Ah, thank you.”

 

Victor thanked her and clumsily cleared the document-filled table. Meanwhile, Lady Osborne approached and set down the tray.

 

Ulrich shifted his gaze from the papers to her.

 

Lady Osborne had submitted her resignation a few days ago. She didn’t specify the reason, but Ulrich had a good guess.

 

Lisbell must have persuaded her.

 

But her attitude showed no sign of contempt or discomfort, suggesting she hadn’t told her everything.

 

See, I told you.

 

She couldn’t bring herself to speak about it.

 

A woman who tears up at the mere mention of her mother wouldn’t dare reveal such intimate details. Ulrich chuckled. Lady Osborne glanced at him while pouring the drinks. He shook his head to indicate it was nothing.

 

He turned his gaze to the window.

 

The sunlight was harsh, and the occasional wind that stirred the leaves and buds was hot.

 

Marnia was in the midst of a full-blown summer.

 

Summer at its peak would gradually lose its heat.

 

He had never regretted this before, even despising the heat, wishing each year for it to pass quickly… but now he wanted time to slow down.

 

Because there was a bride for late summer.

 



 

Ulrich lowered his eyes.

 

Without realizing it, he had crushed the cigarette between his fingers.

 

The small bits of cigarette dirtied his fingers.

 

He stared at the mess, brushing it off with his thumb as if he had discovered something strange. Victor, puzzled, handed him a handkerchief. Accepting it, Ulrich repeatedly wiped and examined his fingers.

 

Finally, when his hands were clean, Ulrich spoke.

 

“Ma’am.”

 

“Yes, sir?”

 

“Late summer will be here soon.”

 

“Excuse me?”

 

“Is Lisbell’s wedding preparation going well?”

 

“Ah… yes, I believe so.”

 

Hmm, is that so?

 

It wasn’t welcoming news.

 

“Where is the wedding going to be held?”

 

“Misley.”

 

“Misley, in the east.”

 

Ulrich repeated, smiling lazily.

 

It had always been a lingering doubt.

 

Even now, it was vague, but one thing was clear.

 

The reason he didn’t want late summer to come.

 

“It’s not as far as I thought, which is good.”

 

He wanted to ruin Lisbell’s wedding.

Chapter 34.


Mrs. Osborne tilted the coffee pot, releasing a stream of steam. The faint aroma of coffee intensified, filling the room. The foil-adorned coffee cup floated in her hand, just before it was placed on the table.

 

Crashi

 

Victor, who had been tidying the pile of papers, looked startled. He stood up immediately upon seeing the shattered cup on the floor.

 

“Madam, are you alright? Did any shards hit you?”

 

“Oh, no. I’m fine.”

 

“This is unfortunate. It’s completely broken.”

 

“I’m sorry. It was my mistake…”

 

Victor nodded as if he understood and bent down. Warning her to be careful of the sharp fragments, he began clearing the larger pieces.

 

Meanwhile, Ulrich remained motionless, simply observing the scene. His deepening gaze was fixed on Mrs. Osborne, or more precisely, on her hand that had been holding the cup.

 

“Madam.”

 

“Yes, Master.”

 

“Did your hand shake just now?”

 

To Ulrich’s knowledge, she did not suffer from tremors. Thus, the earlier movement seemed very unnatural. To him, it signified only one thing.

 

“Is there something wrong with your health?”

 

“No, nothing at all. I’ll prepare a fresh pot of coffee immediately.”

 

Though she tried to maintain a professional demeanor, Ulrich noticed her hesitation before grabbing the pot again, a sign that the earlier tremor was involuntary.

 

Come to think of it…

 

He recalled the errand he had sent her on the previous day.

 

A fabricated incident involving bribing the Marnia officials and other related tasks. Mrs. Osborne needed to leave the villa temporarily to deceive Lisbell.

 

Despite Victor’s presence, Ulrich had insisted on sending Mrs. Osborne on the errand.

 

She took longer than expected.

 

It was a simple task—delivering an entrusted item to a foreign family with whom they had long-standing ties. For Victor, with a family-provided carriage, it would have been a day’s job. But Mrs. Osborne took longer than anticipated, making it barely in time to avoid ruining everything.

 

Timing worked out, so Ulrich hadn’t questioned it then. But now, he understood that her health might have delayed her.

 

“Is your health the reason you submitted your resignation a few days ago?”

 

Mrs. Osborne looked up as she set the hastily brewed coffee in front of Ulrich. He smiled at her before turning to Victor.

 

“Victor, is there a doctor we can summon from the city?”

 

“A doctor?”

 

While Victor questioned this, Mrs. Osborne quickly straightened, realizing Ulrich’s intention.

 

“Master, I appreciate your concern, but I assure you I am fine. There’s no need to worry.”

 

“To me, this isn’t even a concern, Madam.”

 

“But…”

 

“Consider it my kindness before you resign.”

 



 

“Our meeting here is fate, after all.”

 

Fate.

 

Ulrich smirked, unwilling to listen to any objections. He unfolded a paper, savoring the word. It felt pleasant on his tongue.

 

He smiled quietly, a serene smile that subdued the fierce summer sun.

 



 

Giggles, giggles.

 

Listening to the children’s innocent laughter, Lisbell leaned back. She sat on an old bench, the only shaded area behind the orphanage. Recently, the summer had deepened, causing sweat to pour out just by standing outside for a moment.

 

“Oh…!”

 

Something touched her cheek as she sat absentmindedly.

 

Startled, she straightened to find Theodore, who had been playing with the children, approaching. He held a reddish flower and smiled brightly.

 

“You scared me. What’s with the flower?”

 

“It’s a trumpet vine. I brought it to show you since it bloomed inside.”

 

Theodore sat beside her and placed the flower behind her ear, making her laugh. He then gently touched her forehead.

 

“How do you feel?”

 

“Much better.”

 

“Still, you should rest today. There’s no need to push yourself.”

 

Hesitating, Lisbell took his hand from her cheek and shook her head, indicating she was fine.

 

She knew why he was worried.

 

Since returning from Marnia, Lisbell had been ill for a week.

 

It started with muscle pain. Seeing Theodore at the train station, her tension melted away, and her whole body ached. Every step felt heavy and painful.

 

Back at the orphanage, she developed a fever. Her body rebelled, realizing it was finally home.

 

For days, she suffered a severe fever, her white skin blooming with heat rashes.

 

Theodore took care of her devotedly, cooling her with cold hands, wiping her sweat, and holding her when she felt nauseous.

 

After a week of care, she recovered. By then, the wound inflicted by Ulrich had also improved. Luckily, Theodore thought she had a simple fever.

 

“I should inform Madam. She was very worried about you.”

 

After three days of fever, when she could finally speak, Lisbell answered Theodore’s pressing questions.

 

The events in Marnia were just a misunderstanding, she said.

 

Everything was resolved.

 

Her mother was safe.

 

There were no problems….

 

Half-truths and half-lies.

 

When she finished, Theodore hugged her tightly. In his arms, she vaguely realized it was more about convincing herself than him.

 

Feeling his gentle touch, Lisbell sensed her heart pounding with foreboding.

 

A heavy burden had settled in her heart.

 

She now had a secret she could never share with Theodore.

 

Ulrich’s presence had changed everything. Now, she had something to hide from Theodore.

 

She returned to Misley longing for his warmth, but every embrace made her anxious. The burden in her heart grew.

 

“The weather is so hot; it must be uncomfortable not tying your hair.”

 

Theodore tucked her grey hair behind her ear, his touch lingering on her exposed white neck. The sensation made Lisbell flinch.

 

“I-it’s fine. This much is okay.”

 

But the evidence of what she tried to hide remained.

 

The bruise on her neck.

 

The scarf Ulrich had given her had hidden it from her mother. But she had thrown it away the moment she left the villa, unable to bear it.

 

So, Theodore saw the bruise. She blamed it on a fall, but even she knew it was a weak excuse. Her poor condition had deflected further questions.

 

“Lisbell, by any chance….”

 

Theodore began to speak after a moment of silence.

 

Thud, roll.

 

Something rolled to Lisbell’s feet.

 

A bright red apple. 


Chapter 35.


A round shape cast a long shadow behind it.

 

Lisbell held her breath.

 

It had been like this ever since she started seeing those dismal shadows. After witnessing someone’s cruel nature in the shadows that must form as brilliantly as the afternoon light, she often found herself like this.

 

“Lisbelli”

 

A girl with short hair and a petite frame, Mary, suddenly appeared. The world that had momentarily stopped for Lisbell resumed its normal pace.

 

Mary picked up an apple that had rolled to Lisbell’s feet and held it out to her.

 

“It’s a fallen fruit.”

 

Lisbell blinked and then laughed.

 

“Is this for me?”

 

“Yesi”

 

“Thank you. But weren’t we all harvesting together? What if you get scolded later for giving this to me secretly?”

 

Behind the orphanage, there was a small garden and a modest apple orchard. The apples were used for the children’s education, for their meals, and were even sold at the market near the port.

 

Teachers and children had gathered here early in the morning to harvest the ripe apples. Lisbell had come out to experience the bustle firsthand.

 

“Well, the teacher said this was a fallen fruit, so it’s not needed.”

 

“Ah…”

 

Lisbell looked at the fruit in Mary’s hand. Mary, clinging to her knee, asked,

 

“Hey, Lisbell, what’s a fallen fruit?”

 

“It’s a fruit that falls from the tree before it’s harvested.”

 

“I see. But why isn’t it needed?”

 

“Well… When a fruit falls to the ground, it gets bruised or dirty, so its value decreases.”

 

Though she explained it logically, Lisbell also found it hard to understand. Looking around, the apple only had some dirt on it, and seemed otherwise fine.

 

But to think its market value dropped just because it fell before proper harvesting.

 

It seemed unfair to the fruit, which probably didn’t fall on purpose. Lisbell rubbed the apple’s surface with her sleeve, revealing a transparent red hue.

 

“Thanks. Even if it’s a fallen fruit, it’s a precious gift to me.”

 

“Really?”

 

She patted Mary’s head as the girl, with a flushed face, asked again. Mary, who had been chattering while leaning on Lisbell’s knee, dashed off as soon as she heard someone calling her from afar.

 

Lisbell looked down at her knee where the child’s warmth had vanished. An apple and a single trumpet creeper blossom lay neatly on it.

 

“Do you like it that much?”

 

“Huh?”

 

“You couldn’t take your eyes off it.”

 

“Just…”

 

Looking at it brought her peace. Her turbulent mind calmed, and the inexplicable anxiety subsided. Perhaps it was the warmth she had always felt in Misley.

 

So, is this my sanctuary?

 

As Lisbell toyed with the vibrant red petals, she glanced to the side.

 

“By the way, wasn’t there something you wanted to say earlier?”

 

“Oh.”

 

He awkwardly scratched the back of his neck.

 

“Well… I was wondering if something happened in Marnia.”

 

The hand playing with the petals stopped.

 

“Since you came back, you seem to be in a daze more often.”

 

“…Nothing happened.”

 

“Really? Maybe it’s just travel fatigue since you had to rush back and forth. The distance between the two regions is quite significant.”

 

“Yeah, probably.”

 

Her mind seemed to short-circuit for a moment.

 

She couldn’t think about what expression she was making or how it might look to Theodore.

 

“Theo, sorry if I made you worry.”

 

“It’s finei We’re about to get married, so it’s natural for me to take care of you.”

 

“…Right.”

 

“Wow, time really flies. It feels like just yesterday when we told the director together. Don’t you think so?”

 

Looking up at the sky, Theodore reminisced as he pushed her long hair back and stroked her cheek. His hand felt warmer than before.

 

No, her skin had cooled that much.

 

Or perhaps it was her heart….

 

“Anyway, we can’t fall behind the kids. I’ll join in and finish quickly. Lisbell, if it gets too hot, don’t push yourself and go rest insidei”

 

Lisbell watched Theodore’s lithe figure as he shouted and dashed off. All that remained was the pounding of her heart.

 

As she stood there, she noticed a crushed flower petal. The wrinkles from being squished looked grotesque. She couldn’t even remember when it had ended up in such a state.

 

That was the problem.

 

Her sanctuary had started to crack.

Time passed quickly.

 

Day by day.

 

Each morning, her mood changed. Some days she was excited, some days overwhelmed. Some days she felt suffocated as if the future was invisible, and other days she was calm, believing things would work out somehow.

 

The one thing that lightened her heavy heart was the recent news from her mother.

 

Her mother had officially submitted her resignation and would stay on as a caretaker only until the end of the month.

 

Despite returning safely to Misley, many things were still bothering her. Among them was her mother’s safety, who was still working under Ulrich Altahart. She had always been uneasy about it. There was even a bit of resentment wondering why her mother hadn’t listened to her pleas to leave.

 

So, hearing the news about her resignation was a small relief amidst the misfortune. Lisbell reminded herself that there were only a few days left until she would no longer need to call that villa.

 

Everything was slowly getting sorted out.

 

Her mother would soon be free from that devilish man, and she would marry Theodore and leave for another country. The emotional turmoil she felt here would soon be resolved.

 

With the wedding date approaching, the preparations were in their final stages. Today, she and Theodore had chosen plumbago to decorate the venue after much discussion. The blue hue of plumbago, often associated with summer, made her heart flutter thinking about the decorated venue.

 

When they reached the orphanage, Lisbell’s steps stopped involuntarily.

 

“So… Lisbell?”

 

Theodore, who had been talking with gestures, turned his head curiously. But Lisbell couldn’t meet his eyes.

 

A sedan was parked in front of the orphanage. Its presence was unsettling in this rural village, where such a car was uncommon.

 

“Oh, whose car is that…. Is there a visitor?”

 

Theodore mumbled, following Lisbell’s gaze. She couldn’t respond. In fact, she couldn’t react at all.

 

No way….

 

It can’t be.

 

A sharp sense of foreboding hit her chest. A tense feeling crept from her toes. This feeling wasn’t entirely unfamiliar; she had felt it before.

 

When was it?

 

Perhaps it was….

 

“You’re finally here!”

 

A teacher noticed them and waved from a window. Lisbell looked at her with a pale face. The teacher, looking unusually excited, pointed inside.

 

“Lisbell, you have a visitor. Hurry to the reception roomi”

 

“A visitor?”

 

Theodore tilted his head.

 

“Lisbell, were you expecting someone today?”

 



 

“Lisbell?”

 

“Uh? Oh, well, I guess I’ll find out when I go.”

 

Her vision blurred again. As Lisbell entered the orphanage, she clenched and unclenched her fists. Despite the lingering heat of summer, she felt a strange chill.

 

The usually short-seeming corridor seemed unusually long today. When they arrived at the reception room, Theodore opened the door. The slowly widening gap felt like the entrance to a swamp.

 

And her fear was confirmed.

 

“Oh.”

 

The person inside turned toward the door. Platinum hair that remained bright even under the dim lighting.

 

“You’re finally here, Lisbell.”

 

Her anxious heart finally stopped.

 

Ulrich, he was right there.


Chapter 36.


The man had grown up properly.

 

While Lisbell stayed in Marnia, she had never seen him wear a tie properly. Additionally, she found out yet another fact she was not curious about. That black tie was not only a gift from her but also the very thing that had brutally strangled her neck that night.

 

Instinctively, Lisbell touched her neck. The bruises had healed to the point where they were no longer visible. There was no reason for her to feel pain, yet it hurt as if it hadn’t healed at all.

 

Why is this man here?

 

Lisbell thought and thought again. But she couldn’t figure it out. No matter how much she racked her brain, she couldn’t understand why someone she thought she’d never encounter again had appeared in front of her.

 

Of all times.

 

“Who… who are you?”

 

Of all times, when she was with Theodore.

 

Since she couldn’t readily speak, Theodore voiced it instead. Ulrich’s blue-grey eyes, which had been fixated on Lisbell since his appearance, shifted slowly.

 

He smiled a smile beautiful enough to make any man tremble.

 

“Theodore Motier, I presume?”

 

“Yes, that’s correct.”

 

Ulrich approached with the grace of a swan gliding over the water and extended his hand.

 

“Nice to meet you. I’m Ulrich Altahart.”

 

“Alta…”

 

As Theodore reflexively extended his arm for a handshake, his eyes gradually widened.

 

“Al, Altahart?”

 

“Yes.”

 



 

“Are you refusing to shake hands?”

 

Ulrich remained calm in front of the stunned Theodore. The composure he exhibited in Marnia was unchanged here in Misley. Theodore, urged by the noble pressure to hurry up and shake hands, quickly responded.

 

Lisbell gazed distantly at the two men shaking hands.

 

It was a surreal scene. But it didn’t last long. The moment Ulrich’s gaze returned to her, she was dragged back to this dizzying reality.

 

“Lisbell.”

 

Ulrich called her name as if he were very glad to see her. Even the playful laugh at the end, where he rolled his tongue, remained the same.

 

He was, as expected, himself. Unlike her, who was anxious, his calm demeanor was chilling. Lisbell, frozen, quickly noticed Theodore’s eyes turning towards her and hurriedly snapped out of it.

 

“What brings you here…?”

 

“Sorry for showing up unannounced. I have something urgent to tell Lisbell.”

 

He smirked. It was as if he was mocking her cautiousness. Seeing that, the guilt that had corroded black in her chest came alive, unmistakably vivid.

 

Whether this rhythm would quicken or slow was entirely up to Ulrich’s deceitful lips.

 

So, it was appropriate to send Theodore away quickly.

 

There was a risk that Ulrich might drop a bombshell in his presence. However… she hesitated because she didn’t want to be alone with Ulrich. And Ulrich seemed to sense this too, tilting his head thoughtfully.

 

“Shall I bring it up with Mr. Motier here? I don’t particularly mind.”

 

Her heart twisted. Despite being its owner, it felt as though her heart was in another’s grip. Ah, it was because this was an unmistakable threat. Ulrich was subtly pressuring her to send Theodore away.

 

If she didn’t…

 

“Theo.”

 

“Yes?”

 

“Could you… leave us for a moment?”

 

Theodore’s eyes widened. He was astonished not only by the fact that someone with the name Altahart had come here but also by the implication that Lisbell knew him well enough to talk privately.

 

“Ah, sure. I’ll be outside, so please feel free to talk.”

 

Theodore bowed his head and exited the reception room. The sound of the door closing felt like a thin barrier between Ulrich and herself breaking. It was as if the protective layer that had provided some comfort by merely existing had crumbled.

 

“How have you been?”

 

Lisbell flinched at the warmth touching her cheek and stepped back.

 

Her back hit the closed door with a thud.

 

Ulrich’s hand, which had naturally cupped her cheek, found itself awkwardly suspended in the air. He looked at his empty hand and clenched and unclenched it. Soon, he laughed as if it were amusing and withdrew his arm.

 

He turned and walked to the dresser in the reception room. He began to fiddle with the frames, nameplates, and figurines displayed there as if examining them. While he leisurely explored the interior, Lisbell stood frozen by the door.

 

“I hear this chapel is your wedding venue?”

 

“…Did you investigate me?”

 

“Investigate?”

 

His response indicated it was preposterous.

 

“I learned it all here. When I mentioned your name, the person who guided me here eagerly shared information. It was quite bothersome, listing things I wasn’t interested in.”

 

Shaking his head slowly as if expressing fatigue, he would occasionally let out a deflated laugh.

 

“How could you think of holding a wedding in such a shabby place…”

 



 

“But it oddly suits you, so I can’t complain.”

 

Lisbell clenched her fists tightly. She wondered why she had to listen to such evaluations from a man like him.

 

“Please answer me now.”

 

“Hm?”

 

“The reason you came here.”

 

“Ah, that.”

 

Despite the gravity of the subject, his demeanor remained nonchalant. Even when addressing the most crucial topic, he acted as if it was of no importance. His playful gestures with the antler-shaped figurine reflected this.

 

“Mrs. Osborne has collapsed.”

 

He said it with such a casual attitude that it was hard to accept.

 

“…Pardon?”

 

“To be precise, she collapsed and had to undergo emergency surgery. I covered the entire cost.”

 



 

“She’s currently in a hospital in Marnia, but there’s no sign of her regaining consciousness.”

 

Lisbell doubted her ears.

 

“Wha… What are you…”

 

“The doctor said she seemed to have been suffering from symptoms for quite some time. Did you not know?”

 

“Mother collapsed…”

 

No matter how many times she chewed over the sentences, they were hard to accept. But contrary to her mind, her chest stirred as if she had already understood.

 

Briefly, a hairline of doubt surfaced.

 

Could it be true?

 

Given that it was Ulrich delivering such tragic news, it was only natural to doubt. He had once deceived her using her mother. There was no reason he couldn’t do it twice.

 

Suppressing the tumult within, Lisbell stared directly at him.

 

“I’m sorry, but I can’t believe you.”

 



 

“My mother was healthy when we last met. Just a week ago, we talked on the phone.”

 

“That would make sense. She collapsed four days ago.”

 



 

“Previously, when she tried to bring me coffee, her hands shook and she broke the cup. Considering she never had tremors, it seemed odd. So, I intended to call a doctor from the capital. You know better than anyone that she recently submitted her resignation. I thought it was a final gesture of kindness.”

 

Kindness.

 

The word he used reeked of insincerity.

 

“But she refused, saying it was too much of a fuss for a mere favor. She found it burdensome. Like mother, like daughter; both fuss over trivial matters.”

 



 

“Anyway… she refused, and eventually, an accident happened. The doctor said if my secretary had found her any later, it would have been disastrous.”

 

What was he saying?

 

Though he kindly explained, Lisbell’s mind grew emptier. The only thing that came to mind was her mother’s complexion, which she had to ask about each time they met.

 

Saying she was fine, nothing was wrong. Her mother’s assurances had made her overlook the signs, thinking nothing more of them…

 

“I need to contact her.”

 



 

“I need to contact my mother.”

 

“I told you she’s unconscious.”

 

“You’ve already deceived me like this once beforei”


Chapter 37.

The shrill voice filled the reception room.

 

Despite being just a single sentence, Lisbell was out of breath. No, maybe she was suffocating. She couldn’t tell. It was that suffocating. If there were no eyes on her, she would have clutched her chest long ago.

 

But she didn’t want to show any weakness in front of Ulrich, that man. She wanted to hide it so he would never see it. Because his wickedness would dig into each of those aspects and try to use them as a weakness.

 

Ulrich clicked his tongue as if to be heard, looking at the resistant Lisbell.

 

“I understand you don’t trust me, but if you try to be hostile to the person who came all the way here to deliver this news, only Lisbell will be at a loss.”

 



 

“Even if you vent your meaningless anger here, it won’t bring your mother back to consciousness.”

 

He threw a heart-piercing statement and headed to the sofa in the reception room to pick something up. It was a bouquet that Lisbell hadn’t noticed, so focused was she on his presence.

 

Tuberose with long green stems and layers of pure white petals.

 

As he walked over, holding it in one hand, Lisbell reflexively stepped back. But her back was already against the door. There was nowhere else to retreat.

 

The remaining distance was just a step. He could touch her with a slight lift of his hand. Lisbell stiffened completely in astonishment. Ulrich grabbed her chin, lifting it so their eyes could meet.

 

“Why are you trembling like this?”

 



 

“I haven’t done anything…”

 

His subtly flowing tone wrapped around her limbs like a snake with fangs.

 

Ah, a strong sense of déjà vu.

 

It wasn’t much different from when she saw him in the backlight, kneeling. Knowing she couldn’t match him, yet having to face him, the psychological pressure crushed her insides. Like facing a vast ocean that threatened to swallow her whole if she made one wrong move…

 

“Listen well. I won’t say it three times.”

 



 

“Your mother is currently hospitalized at a hospital in Marnia after surgery, and I came here to inform you as her family.”

 

He tightened his grip on her chin.

 

Pulling her face to a slightly better angle, he kissed her pale cheek.

 

“If you don’t believe me, Lisbell can go to Marnia herself and check.”

 



 

“Oh, and this is a gift.”

 

He handed her the bouquet he was holding. The closer scent of the flowers was overwhelmingly strong. Was that why she felt so dizzy? Or maybe…

 

With those words, Ulrich left the reception room. Lisbell, left with the bouquet in full bloom, scrubbed her cheek with the back of her hand until it hurt. Yet, she couldn’t get rid of the feeling. Knowing nothing was actually there, she still couldn’t stand it.

 

“No.”

 

It must be a lie.

 

“That can’t be true…”

 

Mother was healthy.

 

There were no problems at all.

 

He might be trying to deceive her again and drag her into danger.

 

It must be.

 

It must be…

 

Lisbell, standing there, threw the bouquet he handed her to the floor.

 

With a thud, the loosely wrapped flower stems scattered around. The white petals lay scattered at her feet, looking both beautiful and miserable. Lisbell staggered, looking down at the sight.

 

No, no, no.

 

Repeating it to herself did no good. There was a thin thread of anxiety welling up, pushing through the narrow gaps of her consciousness.

 

What if it’s true?

 

What if, as he said, her mother suddenly collapsed and underwent surgery?

 

And what if she still hasn’t regained consciousness?

 

What then?

 

In a moment of weakness, her energy drained. Despite the intense contemplation, the conclusion was surprisingly clear. There was no other way. Unless she went to Marnia herself, she couldn’t confirm it.

 

Believing her mother would be fine while ignoring the increasingly thin face she’d seen from time to time, and as her guardian, she should be by her side if any problem occurred.

 

So, in the end.

 

I have to go to Marnia… again.

 

Lisbell’s head slowly dropped.

 

The white petals scattered around looked just like snowflakes. Was it summer or winter now? The seasons briefly overlapped, confusing her. Why was her whole body growing so cold if it was summer?

 

“Lisbell?”

 

Suddenly, her arm was grabbed.

 

Lisbell shuddered as if in a fit. The recollection of a night in Marnia made her react hypersensitivity.

 

“Ah, The, Theo.”

 

Her wildly shaking focus found its place only after confirming the person was her fiancé.

 

“What’s wrong? Why are you like this?”

 

The voice, genuinely worried about her, finally reminded her it was summer. A distinct warmth approached and embraced her. Lisbell looked at him with a melancholy heart.

 

Theodore’s palm cupped her cheek.

 

“More importantly, what’s this about Altahart? Isn’t he the owner of the villa where your mother works? Did you have such a close relationship for him to come looking for you? What was so urgent between you two?”

 

“Theo.”

 

Lisbell took a shallow breath and spoke slowly.

 

“I need to go to Marnia.”

 

“What?”

 

“I have something to confirm.”

 

She grabbed his hand, which was on her cheek, and pulled it down. Theodore, who seemed to follow gently, soon changed direction and grabbed her shoulder.

 

“Lisbell. Did something happen?”

 



 

“Your complexion is too pale. What did that man say to you?”

 

“I’ll tell you…”

 



 

“I’ll tell you everything when I get back.”

 

She didn’t want to share her burden of worries with Theodore when her mother’s situation wasn’t confirmed yet.

 

The future also depended on this situation’s outcome. For now, she assumed her mother would be safe, but if not, there were many things to consider.

 

If her mother required intensive care… Lisbell might have to reconsider this marriage for financial reasons.

 

Though her situation was one thing, she knew well how much Theodore had looked forward to this wedding. She couldn’t let him be rooted in anxiety for something that wasn’t yet certain. Hadn’t she caused him enough worry last time? She didn’t want to push him into another period of anxious waiting.

 

“So, can’t you wait for me?”

 

“Lisbell…”

 

“I know the wedding is soon. I promise I’ll be back before then.”

 

The strength left his hands on her shoulders. Feeling this, Lisbell bit her lip. The sensation of her body being roughly kneaded was vivid. Anxiety spread like a disease.

 

“Okay.”

 

His touch didn’t completely leave her. Instead, he moved behind and hugged her tightly.

 

“Okay, so calm down.”

 



 

“You’re still shaking.”

 

His voice, reminding her of her unnoticed state, was full of concern. Lisbell, who hadn’t reacted for a moment, buried her tear-streaked face in his comforting embrace.

 

I also want to stop trembling now.

 

I want to stop being driven by this unknown dread…

 

Words she couldn’t voice piled up inside her. They were as murky as a sewer.

 



 

Even with urgent thoughts, she couldn’t change the physical distance.

 

Clunk, clunk. It was unclear whether the shaking was from the train or her insides.

 

In such a state of anxiety, she finally arrived in Marnia.

 

As she hurried out of the station, she noticed a familiar figure cutting through the morning light.

 

Victor, the man she had briefly been introduced to in the garden of the villa last time, was standing by a stopped car, looking her way. It was as if he had come to pick her up. Confirming her suspicions, he bowed his head slightly in greeting.

 

“Master sent me.”

 

With a short explanation of his presence, he opened the back door of the sedan. Lisbell clenched her sweaty hands once, then released them.

 

Though she didn’t want to accept his kindness, she knew better than anyone that such resistance would be futile. She had to head to the hospital anyway, and this car would take her there. Moreover, she had to find traces of Ulrich Altahart, and his secretary was right in front of her.

 

Lisbell silently got into the car.

 

As it started moving, the small scenery of Marnia flowed in like liquid through the window.

 

It had become so blurry that it no longer looked beautiful to her.


Chapter 38.



It was a small city, so they arrived at the hospital quickly.

 

Lisbell followed Victor, who was leading the way.

 

The hospital in the morning was quiet. Every time she saw a patient lying in bed, she flinched. She feared that someone with their face hidden by the blanket might be her mother, a fear that lingered instinctively.

 

Victor didn’t stop walking for quite a while. He finally halted deep inside the hospital, in a secluded area. He opened a closed door and stepped aside as if to tell her to go in.

 

Lisbell didn’t step forward immediately but raised her head first.

 

Beyond the doorframe, like a boundary, sat a man in front of a window where a gentle breeze blew.

 

His golden hair, easily swayed by the slightest breeze, his straight posture, crossed legs, and the book in his hand created a refined appearance that seemed unbelievable for someone who had once trampled on her dignity.

 

He sensed her presence and lifted his head. Upon seeing Lisbell at the door, he closed the book with a soft “Ah.”

 

By then, Lisbell’s gaze had already shifted.

 

Her eyes, lukewarm when directed at the man, now trembled. Her face turned pale. She crossed the threshold, her cautious steps betraying the wariness that had kept her standing. Her dragging steps resembled someone being pulled by the nape.

 

“Uh…”

 

Her legs nearly gave out several times. Despite her staggering, Lisbell headed inside the room, determined to reach the one lying in bed.

 

“Mother…”

 

Reaching the bed, Lisbell collapsed. She couldn’t believe it, couldn’t accept that her mother was lying there like a living corpse, as the man had said. Her vision blurred with tears.

 

Lisbell pulled back the blanket and touched the hand beneath it.

 

She tried to feel the warmth of life, but it was different from her expectations. It was cold, like touching a corpse. Shocked, she quickly covered the hand with the blanket again. Covering it didn’t change anything, but she couldn’t face the reality. Lisbell, her face stained with tears, stared blankly at the bed.

 

“Why…”

 



 

“How much pain were you in…”

 

She could hardly breathe.

 

She hadn’t known her mother was in such a state until now, and the man who had taken care of her mother, who had been so dangerous, was the same one who had dragged her into this abyss. Now, he was the only one who could verify her mother’s condition.

 

The layered despair tightened around Lisbell’s throat.

 

“It seems the problem started with her bronchial tubes.”

 



 

“It would have been good if something had been done then, but it was neglected and spread to other organs, resulting in this critical state. I heard she was suffering from several illnesses even before she collapsed.”

 

Ulrich placed his book aside and approached the bed. He crouched next to Lisbell, who was sitting beside the bed, meeting her eyes.

 

“If you don’t believe me, I can call the doctor who operated on her to speak with you directly.”

 

His sharp gaze was another form of intimidation.

 

Accusing her of disbelief to her face, challenging her to deny the reality before her eyes.

 

Lisbell felt as though her nerves were coiling like they were facing a giant wave. Instinctively, she turned her head away, only for her chin to be grabbed and pulled back sharply.

 

“So, you should say thank you.”

 



 

“If it weren’t for me, your mother might be in a grave by now.”

 



 

“Despite me saving your mother’s life out of goodwill, Lisbell doesn’t even say thank you.”

 

It wasn’t a mere criticism but a quiet reprimand. Once elegant, now it wasn’t. In the room with just two people and a living corpse, he showed his true nature without hesitation.

 

Lisbell, her face soaked with tears, trembled. Ulrich smiled at her pitiable state. He wiped her wet cheek with his fingers, an act that felt almost coercive, forcing Lisbell to respond.

 

“Th-thank you.”

 



 

“Thank you for saving my mother.”

 

The man who instilled deep-seated fear within her, she had to thank him. The reality was wretched. She hated him for diluting her hatred in this way. With a twisted heart, Lisbell expressed her gratitude.

 

Could anything be more ambivalent?

 

The man who had temporarily crushed her was the same one who saved her mother. She had no choice but to thank him. It was like kneeling before resentment. The nauseating contradiction returned as invisible arrows tearing at her heart.

 

Satisfied with Lisbell’s compliance, he smiled serenely. His hand remained on her face, and so did his gaze. Ulrich’s eyes bore into her tear-streaked, distorted face.

 

When his gaze became unbearable, he finally withdrew his hand.

 

Lisbell quickly raised her arm to wipe her face.

 

From now on, she needed to pull herself together. Knowing her mother’s condition was so severe, there were many practical matters to consider.

 

In truth, she wanted to escape Ulrich’s realm as soon as possible. She couldn’t bear him grasping her weaknesses one by one.

 

“I will never forget this favor. I will take care of my mother from now on…”

 

“Who said you could?”

 

“…What?”

 

“Who said you could take her away?”

 

“What do you mean…”

 

“The surgery costs, the hospitalization fees…”

 



 

“You can’t be so naive. Are you so unaware of the ways of the world?”

 

Lisbell’s expression stiffened.

 

Yes, he was right.

 

It was a considerable amount of money that Ulrich had spent on her mother’s treatment, a sum that was meant for Lisbell’s family.

 

Knowing this, it was still hard to conceal her bitterness.

 

While in Marnia, he had willingly paid for even her personal expenses. She knew it was improper, but this amount wouldn’t even dent his finances. Yet, mentioning costs now was…

 

“Are you saying I should repay you?”

 

“Everything should be accounted for.”

 



 

“If word gets out that I let someone off without paying, what will happen to Altahart’s reputation as a businessman?”

 

Resigned to the inevitable, Lisbell closed her eyes tightly. Unwiped tears rolled down her pale cheeks. Ulrich watched her as if he might lick away the traces and then stood up.

 

He handed her a document from a table. With trembling hands, Lisbell took it.

 

The detailed figures made it clear it was an estimate from the hospital.

 

But the amount was much larger than she expected.

 

How could she pay this?

 

Even if she abandoned her wedding plans and used all her savings, it was doubtful she could cover it. Moreover, if she used all the money for the surgery, what about the future treatment costs for her mother?

 

The more she thought, the more hopeless it seemed.

 

Each clash with reality extended her thoughts into pathetic directions. Finally, she had to speak.

 

Could anyone in Rechem boast of wealth before this man? She rationalized, telling herself now wasn’t the time for pride, and her flimsy justifications became her only solace.

 

“I’m sorry, but I don’t have the means to repay…”

 

“No money.”

 



 

“Then what else?”

 

Was he talking about valuables? Lisbell, who had lived as a commoner with no interest in adornment, had none.

 

“I don’t have any.”

 



 

“I have nothing.”

 

“You have nothing?”

 



 

“You have your body.”

 

Before her hesitant words could reach him, Ulrich’s fingers touched her body. His hand moved to her chest, an area too intimate for anyone else to touch so casually.

 

“You have this body.”


Chapter 39.


Tap.

 

With a firm push, his playful gesture nudged her body backward.

 

Thus, Lisbell understood his hidden intention a beat too late. But even understanding didn’t mean she could act immediately. In reality, she was frozen with another meaning, unable to blink an eyelid.

 

“I could do it right now.”

 

The corners of the man’s eyes folded like a hawk’s wings. Smiling leisurely and beautifully, he slowly lowered his fingers.

 

From her chest to her solar plexus.

 

“I want to go in here.”

 

Past her navel, sinking in a little lower…

 

“…Ah…!”

 

The movement was sudden. It might even be called a desperate struggle.

 

The moment Lisbell realized where Ulrich’s hand was headed, she twisted her body. However, Ulrich, who had anticipated her move, pushed her down forcefully.

 

Her ash-gray hair spread across the cold hospital floor. Lisbell stared dazedly at the sinister figure looming over her.

 

“…I’ll pay it back somehow.”

 

“How?”

 

“By any means necessary…”

 

“By any means?”

 

“So please… don’t do this.”

 

“What have I done?”

 



 

“Naive and yet so scared…”

 



 

“See, I told you you’re just like a cat.”

 

Ah, his playful attitude only made her feel more ridiculous.

 

It wasn’t as if he was recklessly charging at her like last time, but she felt no relief. His eyes, looking down at her so detachedly, only reflected the primal joy of a beast cornering its prey for sport.

 

“My wedding is not far off.”

 

“I know, it’s late summer now.”

 

“I’m getting married…”

 

“Do you want me to congratulate you again?”

 

It felt like talking to a wall. Whether he felt the same way or not, Ulrich squinted as if he couldn’t understand, then let out a soft “Ah” and smirked. He lifted his damp fingers to her cheek.

 

“Do you think I’m asking you to give up on your wedding?”

 



 

“I’m not. If you want to be the bride in late summer, then go ahead.”

 



 

“But can you really do that?”

 

Though his tone was gentle, his words pierced her heart savagely.

 

“You plan to offer your body to another man and then still go through with your engagement? Do you think you can handle that with your weak nature?”

 

His sneer was biting.

 

He always ridiculed her.

 

Only now was she vaguely realizing that this was how he always saw her. Ulrich might have always been mocking her. She had thought he might be good at acting, but that didn’t mean she was exempt from being his target.

 

Ulrich’s flawless social skills might have extended even to her.

 

“You…”

 

As soon as she uttered a word, she realized her mistake. Her pale face and trembling lips revealed her fear.

 

“Have I made a mistake towards you?”

 

“Mistake?”

 

“If not, then why…”

 



 

“Why do you keep doing this to me…?”

 

It was no coincidence. Amidst the continuous incidents, Ulrich’s malice was vividly alive. Even if it was an elaborate plot to bring her down, it was no exaggeration.

 

The theft incident that never happened didn’t need to be mentioned, and this time was no different. While her mother’s condition might have been a coincidence, the fact that he covered the surgery costs to use it against her was entirely his intention and choice.

 

At this point, it was clear to her.

 

Ulrich continuously put her in difficult situations.

 

So, it was all intentional.

 

He had a natural talent for creating situations. With his background and money, there was nothing he couldn’t do, instilling both reverence and fear in her. No matter how much she struggled, she realized it was futile against him…

 

She couldn’t understand why, so she finally voiced it.

 

Mocking me, tormenting me, constantly pushing me like this. What is the underlying reason? Lisbell had no choice but to become genuinely curious.

 

“Why are you doing this?”

 

He looked as if he had been asked an obvious question.

 

“It’s simple.”

 



 

“I can do this.”

 

His eyes, now fully revealing their depths, were chillingly clear. They showed the truth, ideals, and reality. Ulrich truly, without a shadow of a doubt, believed it.

 

“Lisbell, you want to marry Mr. Motier.”

 



 

“I’m doing this because I want to.”

 



 

“Does desire need any more reason?”

 

He whispered, simply saying he wanted to, as if his words were an inexplicable noise in the distance.

 

Lisbell’s eyes fluttered. Tears that hadn’t yet dried flowed down her cheeks.

 

Ulrich eventually wiped them away with his fingers and brought them to his lips. Although it was just a drop of tears, it felt as if her soul had been sucked out… Was this feeling connected to the despair slowly consuming her whole body?

 

Cicadas chirping.

 

The sound of cicadas, a symbol of summer, disrupted the morning hospital atmosphere.

 

The intense sound would fade with time, as was the nature of the returning seasons.

 

But Lisbell couldn’t imagine the end of summer as clearly as before. No matter how hard she tried, it remained blurry as if smudged by her hands.

 

She was certain of one thing.

 

If she hadn’t set foot in Marnia, his paradise, she wouldn’t have ended up at this foolish crossroads.

 



 

Her pupils, widened in shock, gradually calmed.

 

People often make foolish choices even when they know they’re wrong.

 

That’s how Lisbell was now.

 

Her mother lying unconscious in a hospital bed, the secret she hid from Theodore, the insurmountable financial problems, and the precious future she still wanted to protect…

 

Cicadas chirping.

 

The sound of cicadas was still intense.

 

Summer, the season of breeding.

 

Lisbell couldn’t shake off the thought that her misfortune, which fell upon her suddenly, was also breeding like that.

 



 

“…uh.”

 

Her curled-up body shrank even more inward. Like a small pill bug rolling away after being tapped by someone’s foot, Lisbell only showed movements of wanting to hide somewhere. Each time the man’s persistent breath fell on her back, it was the same.

 

“Hah…”

 

His breath was as hot and heavy as if he had swallowed the scorching summer sun.

 

Each drop felt like a heavy rock, difficult to bear. It didn’t just settle; it poured down. The unusual temperature and rhythm made it clear what he was doing now.

 

“uh, Ah…!”

 

Lisbell, who was rubbing her forehead against the sheet, wanted to bury her face entirely to muffle the inevitable moans.

 

But just the other day, she had been severely scolded for trying to stifle her moans. The man had developed a new hobby of listening to her moans. Any attempt to disrupt his newfound pastime was met with harsh retribution.

 

Ulrich, exhaling warm breath, pushed aside the slip covering her back.

 

The rough feel of the lace trim on the slip was strange. Lisbell normally didn’t wear such lacy slips. The fact that she was wearing this and on this bed was entirely his doing.

 

Under the ‘repayment contract’, a few bedroom rules had been established.

 

First, when called, Lisbell must stop whatever she was doing and come to Ulrich’s bedroom. Second, she must wear a slip that was easy to remove.

 

Because of this, with just one movement of his hand, Lisbell had to expose her clean, dry back.


Chapter 40.


Ulrich poked at her sharply raised shoulder blade with his fingertip and pressed the soft flesh firmly with his penis.

 

“Uh…!”

 

Lisbell’s rounded shoulder line trembled. It wasn’t just there that convulsed. The lower part, filled with his entire length, also trembled as if strained.

 

“Lisbell, huh….”

 

In that state, he pressed his pubic bone fully against her perineum, making their lower bodies one. As he gently scratched the entrance with the veins on his penis, Lisbell, who was lying down, vibrated as if hit by a spark.

 

Ulrich, wearing a languid smile, rubbed and ground the deep spot with his glans fully inserted.

 

“Ha, uh! Ah….”

 

“The place you feel is deep.”

 

“Huh, huh…!”

 

“I noticed you react when I touch deep inside your throat too.”

 

“Ah, Ah…!”

 

“I thought it was because it was your first time… but it seems you were born with this preference.”

 

It was Ulrich’s talent to speak elegantly yet crudely. Using that talent without filter, he grabbed her buttocks that curved temptingly. The slight flesh of her buttocks fit perfectly in his hand as he traced the overall outline.

 

Holding it tightly, not allowing any escape, Ulrich relentlessly pounded the inside. The penis, already covered in her fluids, squelched as it moved out, spraying sticky droplets.

 

Licking his lips, he observed the debauched traces. Twisting her buttocks until the flesh was mashed, he spread them wide, making the eager entrance, swollen with small wrinkles, more visible.

 

When he fumbled with one finger, feeling the fervent traces, Lisbell shrank her reddened nape. Smiling silently at her sensitive reaction, he adjusted his posture and thrust deeply into her inner wall.

 

“uh! Ah, Ah…!”

 

Her split buttocks crumbled without resistance, struggling to contain his forearm-sized cock.

 

“Do you know that your belly tenses whenever I rub inside like this?”

 

“Uh, ung….”

 

A snicker. This time, a rather loud laugh descended. Lisbell was now afraid of his laughter. Ulrich no longer hid his sneer towards her. She feared what kind of ridicule it would be, a learned response from past experiences.

 

“You said you wanted to do it from behind first.”

 

“Uh, uh, ah, ah….”

 

“Was it all for this? Hm?”

 

He straightened his spine and slapped, slapped, slappedi pounded Lisbell’s buttocks as he thrust fiercely. Every time the tip of his penis, snaking its way through the curves, hit the stimulation point, white spots burst in her head. She could only clutch the hapless sheet and gasp.

 

No. It wasn’t for that reason at all.

 

The reason for insisting on this position….

 

“You’re trying to have fun in your own way… right.”

 

“Huh….”

 

“Well, I agree. If you’re going to have sex, it’s better to enjoy it together. Probing and touching where it feels good….”

 

Ulrich, panting shortly, quickly shook his pelvis. Each time the man thrust his hips fervently, Lisbell felt as if she were sinking deep somewhere. Even though she was on the bed, it felt like being driven into the cold, hard floor below, inducing a sense of self-loathing.

 

“Huh! Uh…! Ah… uh…!”

 

A large hand crawled inside her nearly stripped slip. Already overwhelmed with tingling and heat, she was disoriented, but his hand still grasped her breast, hitting the peak. The pulling sensation, as if to tear the scant flesh away, spread a numbing sensation. His hands, twirling her nipples, immediately soothed the pain. It was a disorienting caress.

 

“Ah, uh! uh…!”

 

“Ah… tight again. Unless you’re trying to turn me into a premature ejaculator, why don’t you relax a bit.”

 

Ulrich, snickering, grabbed her breasts firmly without wasting any motion and thrust forcefully.

 

Between Lisbell’s reddened buttocks, Ulrich’s clean penis moved in and out relentlessly.

 

As a result, only Lisbell’s pubic hair, moistened with fluid, stuck to her skin. Ulrich, finding the hair similar in color to her own, fondled it curiously while continuing to thrust.

 

Every time he forcefully penetrated the pleasingly tight interior, a thrilling tension pulled at the back of his neck. Like an animal savoring a taste, he licked his lips multiple times, thumping her buttocks rhythmically with his pelvic bone.

 

Even a single thrust pushed so deep that the pressure of organs being squeezed was unrelenting. This made Lisbell, while being penetrated, subconsciously feel her lower abdomen several times. Though knowing it was impossible, she worried her belly might bulge bluntly.

 

“Huh, ah, ah, Ah…!”

 

The erratic speed, alternating between fast and slow like a playful game, began to quicken again.

 

This time, it felt a bit different. Lisbell sensed he was ready to release the built-up sexual tension and clenched her toes, bracing her lower belly.

 

He twisted her erect nipples, hoping she’d better swallow his swollen penis. The force was such that her coral-colored breasts might be pulled out whole. Sometimes he would neglect to exert force where needed and, conversely, handle delicately areas that needed careful attention roughly.

 

“Aah! uh! ah! Ah, Ah…!”

 

Lisbell’s high-pitched moans filled the dark bedroom as Ulrich, grabbing her split buttocks, pulled back. His penis, hard with imminent ejaculation, swelled. The robust organ barely exited, scratching the wet entrance.

 

As Lisbell gasped, her prone body was grabbed, flipping her vision upside down.

 

Having kept her eyes closed throughout the ordeal, the invading light in her barely opened eyes was faint. Unable to gather her sprawling limbs, Ulrich grabbed her chin.

 

“Time to do it.”

 

And third, instead of ejaculating inside, she must always receive his semen orally.

 

Lisbell, with her moist eyelids trembling, slowly parted her lips.

 

Straddling her face, Ulrich looked at her red, crumpled eyes and stroked his trembling penis. His hand movement was obscenely suggestive.

 

The veins on its surface pulsated violently. The thick shaft and the split testicles below seemed impatient to release their fluid, responding obscenely.

 

He shifted his gaze to her slightly open lips and stiffened tongue. As if imagining a rough suck, he eyed her fiercely and pressed his blunt glans into her small mouth.

 

“Uh, uh….”

 

White semen spurted out thickly. Not a single drop of the arousal byproduct escaped Lisbell’s mouth.

 

The sticky taste sweeping through her mouth was torturous. Knowing he wouldn’t like it, Lisbell nonetheless couldn’t help but frown.

 

He smirked, touching her face, which was marred with unsightly wrinkles.

 

“Warm.”

 



 

“Lisbell seems to have a knack for taking things in, either from above or below.”

 

Ulrich, making that comment about Lisbell’s mouth filled with his glans, didn’t withdraw immediately after ejaculating but lightly shook his hips. Although only the glans was inserted, its sheer size made it feel like her mouth was completely full. It was like having someone’s clenched fist in her mouth.

 

The overwhelming weight of the penis, threatening to tear her inner walls of mouth, made Lisbell struggle.



Chapter 41.


Ulrich persistently shook his waist to extract all the liquid before finally pulling the tip out of her mouth.

 

As the accumulated semen inside was pushed out, the white mucus trailed along his organ and her parted lips. Ulrich chuckled at the messy sight and gestured to his genitals.

 

“Will you lick it clean?”

 



 

“You promised to eat it all.”

 

Lisbell stared at him with teary eyes before slowly sticking out her tongue. As she extended her tongue like a cat to lick his erect glans, she felt like a cheap prostitute selling her body for a few coins.

 

Wanting to break away from these self-destructive thoughts, Lisbell hurriedly licked his glans.

 

Ulrich, letting out a deep moan, adjusted the position of his head to make it easier for her to lick.

 

Her soft, wet tongue grazed the thick skin of his glans, the erotic curves on the top, and the small urethral opening in the center.

 

Though slightly softened after one ejaculation, his penis quickly became stimulated and began to swell again under the delicate movements of her tongue. Fully aware of his reaction, Lisbell closed her eyes in despair. Even in this situation, fearing his wrath, she couldn’t stop her tongue. It was the submissive stance of a weakling.

 

“You’re quite good at this now.”

 



 

“When I first told you to do it, you were drooling all over the place.”

 

After confirming that his penis was clean with no traces of semen, he pulled back. Lisbell, withdrawing her tongue which had become numb from the teasing, looked troubled.

 

Ulrich quickly grasped the reason. Like his straight, erect penis, his neatly sprouted fingers pried open Lisbell’s half-closed lips.

 

“…uh!”

 

“Swallow it.”

 

As expected, he confirmed the accumulated semen inside her mouth and sneered. Suspecting she would spit it out when he wasn’t looking, Ulrich pushed his fingers deeper.

 

The intruding fingers soon reached the back of her throat. Lisbell’s legs, pinned beneath him, thrashed as if she were being strangled.

 

Ignoring her violent resistance, Ulrich pushed his fingers deeper into her narrow, wet mouth.

 

Gulp.

 

The taste that finally went down her throat seemed to spread a fishy smell throughout her body.

 

Lisbell, having accidentally swallowed with his fingers still deep in her throat, couldn’t help but retch. As soon as he withdrew his fingers, which had been buried so deep that no knuckles were visible, Lisbell turned her body sharply.

 

“uh, uh…!”

 

As she gagged and curled up, Ulrich gently stroked her tangled hair as if feeling sorry for her.

 

Comforting someone suffering from his actions was truly something only Ulrich could do.

 

Though she wanted to immediately brush away his hand, disgusted, she had no strength left. After a few dry heaves, Lisbell finally regained her composure, but before she could hold onto it, her body was dragged.

 

“Swallowing is nice and all.”

 

“…Ung…”

 

“But it’s a bit disappointing that I can’t kiss you afterward.”

 

“Ung… uh.”

 

“Sucking on Lisbell’s tongue is surprisingly pleasant.”

 

His gaze, staring at her still-wet lips, was displeasing. Despite his penchant for bizarre acts, it seemed he couldn’t bring himself to kiss her mouth filled with his own semen.

 

Instead, he bit her nipples, visible through the thin slip.

 

“Ung…”

 

Lisbell’s hands grabbed his shoulders as if to push him away. Her normally numb nipples felt a sharp thrill from just one flick of his tongue.

 

A man who pulled her to bed every single day, he never forgot to torment and nibble at her breasts. Despite her complaints, he never let go once he bit down.

 

He showed such attachment that sometimes he would bury his face in her flat chest and dawdle.

 

Due to these frequent teases, her breasts had become so sensitive that even a slight pinch or bite could make her back twist.

 

“, …”

 

Lisbell moaned under him as he persistently licked her nipples through the slip. It was her desperate attempt to resist the strange sensation.

 

Has it been about two weeks?

 

Since they began sleeping together.

 

The pain that had dragged her to a living hell on the first night was, fortunately or unfortunately, no longer present. After a few nights, Ulrich learned her sensitive spots, and his quick, efficient lovemaking left Lisbell trapped in waves of unfamiliar pleasure instead of the splitting pain.

 

And each time she realized she was feeling it, she was filled with crushing self-loathing.

 

Feeling sexual pleasure from another man’s touch, not Theodore’s, in such a demeaning way, was unthinkable.

 

She was no different from a beast driven only by instinct.

 

Yet her body, betraying her reason, continued to commit this unimaginable act. The burden on her conscience grew heavier each day.

 

“Ha, uh… stop…”

 

“Stop?”

 

Ulrich, catching her slip of the tongue as she inadvertently voiced her restraint while struggling, asked back as if to catch her off guard.

 

He lifted his head slowly, letting go of her nipple through the slip. His crooked gaze sent a shiver of unease, and then he smirked.

 

“You don’t like it through the clothes?”

 

He immediately pulled the slip aside. Her barely protected breasts were now fully exposed. Burying his nose in her non-existent cleavage, he circled his tongue around the protruding tip.

 

“Ah…!”

 

Lisbell twisted her waist and let out a scream.

 

The difference between being sucked through the clothes and directly on her skin was subtle yet significant. The transfer of saliva from his tongue and how it trailed was conveyed clearly.

 

Indeed, as if substituting for the kiss he couldn’t give, Ulrich stubbornly clung to her nipples.

 

Even the slightest friction from his tongue was enough to make her waist twist, showing how sensitive her breasts had become. He deliberately made a loud sucking sound as he slid his hand down to her groin.

 

“Ung, stop… ah…”

 

Resistance was futile. Before she could even fully voice her protest, two fingers entered her at once, spreading her open.

 

Already melted from several rounds of him tonight, her inner walls parted easily as he scissored his fingers and licked her nipples.

 

Lisbell threw her head back. At some point, her mouth had filled with saliva, unable to swallow as her breath hitched. Meeting Ulrich’s gaze, she knew she couldn’t stop.

 

“No, I don’t want this…”

 

“You don’t want it?”

 

“Ung, ah! Ung…”

 

“Yet you’ve already taken three fingers?”

 

Without her realizing, the number of fingers increased to three, stretching and probing her inner walls. His fingers skillfully targeted her sensitive spots, making her shake her head. The more violently she reacted, the more Ulrich teased her nipples and moved his fingers faster inside her.

 

“Ah, ah… ahh… …”

 

Her groin grew wetter as her body trembled with each pulse. She felt her insides heating up, a terrifying and unpleasant sensation.

 

In the end, her face turned red as she clung to Ulrich’s arm.

 

Finally, the fourth finger.

 

“Ah, from behind, ah, from behind, Ulrich…i”

 

The position was always so she couldn’t see his face, with Lisbell on her stomach.

 

As could be inferred, the rules of their bed play were a strict compromise. For every term from Ulrich’s side, there was a term considering Lisbell’s stance.

 

She saw the contract on the day she returned to this villa and signed it with trembling hands in front of him. How did he react?

 

Ah…

 

He smiled, just like now.

 

Mocking her desperate behavior, Ulrich firmly held Lisbell’s trembling thighs and thrust inside as he pleased. The three fingers, now moving rapidly, turned into a thick rod, tearing her insides apart.

 

“Ah, ah, ah… ah!”

 

Feeling the mess between her legs, goosebumps rose on her skin. Again, the familiar mixture of strange pleasure and self-hatred overwhelmed her.

Chapter 42.


“Wasn’t it just for sex that you wanted to do it from behind?”

 

“Ah, ah, ah, yes…i Ahhh…i”

 

“This isn’t sex. This is, um….”

 

While prodding and rubbing her wet hole with three fingers, he casually remarked.

 

“This is me helping Lisbell have some fun.”

 

“Ung, ah…i Ah, Ah…!”

 

He relentlessly played with Lisbell’s insides as she desperately tried to escape.

 

When she curled up on her side, he continued his actions by lifting one of her overlapping legs. Eventually, he removed two fingers, leaving only his longest middle finger to stir the murky liquid flowing below.

 

“Ah, ah… uh…!”

 

Caught in a near ecstasy, Lisbell reached a trembling climax.

 

As soon as she came, Ulrich withdrew his finger, which had been twisted so erratically it defied rhythm. An opaque liquid trailed down his fingertip.

 

“Haa, ha…”

 

Her vision blurred, her mind shattered.

 

The lingering pleasure left all over her body pushed her deeper into a twisted guilt.

 

Every time she did this with Ulrich and felt it intensely, Theodore’s face would come to mind.

 

It felt like committing adultery.

 

She couldn’t stop crying when suddenly her waist was grabbed, and she was dragged, face down, onto the sheets.

 

The strength spreading her buttocks revealed an unseen lust.

 

An insatiable, grotesque sexual appetite.

 

A terrible sensation of a slippery, massive volume slowly pushing into her cleft.

 

Lisbell buried her tear-streaked face in her arm and quietly wiped away her tears.

 

Opening her weary eyelids, Lisbell realized she had fallen asleep. Curled up in the middle of the bed without a pillow, she blinked sleepily.

 

Just then, the sound of water from beyond ceased.

 

Soon after, Ulrich, with a nightgown over his sculpted naked body, appeared, running his hand through wet hair.

 

“Did you wake up?”

 



 

“You were sleeping so quietly, I thought you might be dead.”

 

Ulrich, making a statement that seemed like a joke, nonchalantly approached the drink table in the bedroom.

 

He always had a whiskey after sex. Though, it seemed not just because of sex. He appeared to be a drinker. Eventually, she found out that there were drink tables with decanters scattered throughout the villa.

 

Today too, he filled his glass generously and took a sip before turning back to the bed.

 

Seeing him, Lisbell pushed away the loosely covered blanket and tried to sit up. The idea that she had slept soundly here felt absurd.

 

Having just woken up, she intended to return to her own bedroom but couldn’t manage it. Every action, from bracing herself on the sheets to lifting her torso and properly sitting down, was more exhausting than she had imagined.

 

The pain from the sex might have subsided, but the lingering muscle soreness was still there. Honestly, she felt too weak to even move a finger. Thinking about returning to her bedroom on another floor made her sigh.

 

More than returning, she wanted to wash away his remnants on her body. When she touched her abdomen to pull off the blanket, she felt something sticky. As soon as she wiped it with her palm, she knew what it was.

 

It was Ulrich’s semen.

 

She remembered it vividly. She had fallen asleep during the act, so he had ejaculated all over her body as if in frustration.

 

Her entire body felt dirty with traces of fatigue and bodily fluids. But she was so exhausted that she couldn’t do anything about it. Even though she was awake, she felt like she was still wandering in a dream.

 

“Want a drink?”

 

Ulrich, watching her from a tilted stance, shook his empty crystal glass.

 

Lisbell touched her lips.

 

It was strange. She hadn’t been conscious of it a moment ago, but the mention of a drink made her want to rinse her mouth. It felt as if the semen he had discharged into her was still filling her mouth.

 

She wanted to run to the bathroom and rinse, but in her current state, even that seemed impossible.

 

Besides, would water be enough to rid her of this taste?

 

She thought it might be better to use the high-proof alcohol, so Lisbell nodded slightly.

 

He poured the crystal glass generously. The sound of pouring filled the quiet bedroom. The space that had been filled with her moans and his breath always felt awkward.

 

Lisbell took the glass he handed her.

 

As soon as she carefully swallowed a sip, she started cough!ng violently.

 

Lisbell grabbed her throat. It was just a sip. Yet it felt like her esophagus was burning. She had heard whiskey was strong but hadn’t imagined it would taste this harsh.

 

The glass slipped from her grasp and rolled off the bed, spilling its contents and wetting the floor. Ulrich looked at the spill and then at Lisbell, who was still cough!ng with a flushed face, and burst into laughter.

 

“…uh…!”

 

The next moment, he pounced on the bed.

 

As his damp blonde hair rustled, Lisbell’s body had already crumpled. He had jumped on her and hugged her tightly.

 

Lisbell felt like dying in a different way.

 

Her whole body already ached as if trampled, and now, on top of the effect of the strong liquor, being pinned down by a much larger man left her disoriented.

 

But her dismay was brief; Lisbell wriggled to escape his embrace.

 

“Let go, let me go. I need to go back to my room….”

 

“Why not stay here tonight? You look too weak to even get up.”

 

Lisbell opened her mouth but then closed it firmly.

 

From her experiences, she knew he was very stubborn. Once he decided on something, he would make sure to see it through. He might say she could do as she wished, but the reality was different. She already saw him in a negative light.

 

Dragging her tired body into an argument, risking another session starting, would be bad for her. She was so exhausted that she could fall asleep immediately if she closed her eyes.

 

I must smell right now….

 

Unlike Ulrich, who had cleaned up, she hadn’t even gotten rid of the sweat accumulated overnight. Falling asleep during sex meant she wasn’t in a clean state.

 

Thinking about it briefly, she changed her mind.

 

Lisbell remembered the repayment contract he had handed her in the parlor. He had proposed replacing her debt with sexual intercourse, specifying the term clearly.

 

The period extended to late summer, almost the end of autumn.

 

Seeing that, Lisbell realized clearly that contrary to his words about not interfering with her marriage to Theodore, he was intent on ruining it. Otherwise, there would be no reason to keep her until late summer.

 

“The period written there could change.”

 



 

“If I get tired of you before then, the contract will end there.”

 

His nonchalant comment while holding a cigarette had struck her deeply. For her, a situation shaking the foundation of her life was just a whim for him, ending whenever he got bored.

 

Was he telling her to have hope or to sink into despair?

 

His words left her uncertain.

 

Ultimately, both despair and hope remained for Lisbell. The nightly endurance was despair, while hope was naturally….

 

[- What do you mean, Lisbell? Postpone the wedding?]

 

When she signed the contract, she didn’t cry. But tears welled up when she called Theodore.

 

Listening to his urgent voice on the other end, Lisbell couldn’t respond immediately. Leaning against the wall, hearing him ask what happened made her feel choked up.

 

All she wanted was to marry Theodore.

 

But why had things turned out this way? Lisbell felt confused and overwhelmed, fearing she might never escape this maze. By the time she realized, her face was already drenched in tears.


Chapter 43.


Drip, drip.

 

I lifted my head hurriedly after only watching the traces of falling droplets on the floor. Theodore’s insistent questioning, sensing something was wrong from my lack of response, demanded my attention.

 

[What’s going on? Are you in trouble? If you’re in Marnia right now, I’ll come to you. Lisbell. Let’s meet and talk.]

 

“No.”

 

[No?]

 

“Don’t come, Theo. You… there’s no need for you to come here.”

 

Swoosh~

 

Guilt stirred again, like a mischief.

 

What started as a small seed had grown to the size of a fist, pounding relentlessly against Lisbell’s heart.

 

[No need…?]

 

Such words born from that kind of heart only led to awkward misunderstandings.

 

Lisbell bit and released her lips as she listened to his reaction over the receiver.

 

Even in this moment, intense dilemmas flooded her mind.

 

Should I tell Theodore everything?

 

Should I tell him that this is happening to me, that the current situation is such that I cannot leave Marnia, that my mother’s life is tied to that man, and that I cannot irresponsibly abandon her to return to you…?

 

Her fingers gripping the receiver turned pale.

 

Soon, a dry laugh slipped quietly.

 

What If I tell him?

 

If I tell him, will all this misfortune that has come to me be resolved?

 

No.

 

Of course, if it were Theodore, he would surely step in wholeheartedly. If I told him I was held hostage for my mother’s surgery costs, he would help with all he had, even if it meant using the funds meant for the wedding. But even if he stepped in, the wedding would still have to be postponed.

 

Even if we managed to repay my mother’s surgery costs and secure our livelihood, what about after that?

 

The repayment contract Ulrich presented included all hospitalization fees for the specified period. The price for her being in his bed was that high. The thought that her mother’s future treatment costs would not be insignificant kept her from stopping such self-destructive judgments.

 

Misfortune doesn’t lessen when shared. It only increases the burden, creating two hardships instead of one. Comforting herself would be brief, but the heavy reality would continue to tighten its grip.

 

That’s why misfortune is called misfortune.

 

Lisbell thought it was enough for her alone to tumble within this misfortune. She loved Theodore too much to drag him further in.

 

In reality, she knew well that, for his sake, she should be asking for a breakup to prevent him from getting hurt any further.

 

But she couldn’t bring herself to do it.

 

Now, this was the only hope she could hold onto…

 

If even this were gone, she wouldn’t be able to endure her time in this villa. Even if it was merely a result of her selfishness, without that small straw, she had nothing else to grasp…

 

“Sorry, Theo. I’ll explain everything later. I’d like to postpone the wedding date to winter.”

 

Her selfishness manifested so clearly. Even if it seemed difficult, she couldn’t utter the words suggesting a breakup. She was fully aware that Theodore might end up disappointed in her and take such a step himself, but still…

 

In truth, she knew Theodore wouldn’t do that.

 

Since she was the one who loved him the most, having known him to always be kind and gentle.

 

That phone call was her last contact with Theodore.

 

And two weeks had passed since then.

 

Lisbell recalled the phone call she ended without hearing an answer and shivered. A strong arm pulled her back firmly by the waist. Ulrich’s gestures were always like this. Whenever he wanted something, he had to pull it right in front of him, never hiding his rudeness.

 

If he were someone who understood such things, he wouldn’t have put her in such trouble in the first place. This method had been ingrained in Ulrich since childhood.

 

“Lisbell, your hair is tangled again.”

 

Ulrich, who was hugging her warmly from behind, buried his face in Lisbell’s ashen hair, tickling her skin.

 

“It tangles so easily.”

 



 

“Is it because it’s thin and wavy…”

 

He pointed out her flaws, but his actions were contrary. He swayed his face leisurely as if enjoying something pleasant.

 

Lisbell closed her eyes, ignoring his warm breath on the back of her head. She wanted to fall asleep like this, but she was bothered by Ulrich constantly stroking her flat lower abdomen with his broad palm. She had an uneasy feeling that it would soon change its demeanor and threaten her.

 

“Do you know the large farm in Crimpford?”

 

So, she couldn’t easily fall asleep, and Ulrich suddenly asked. Lisbell didn’t answer. It seemed he wasn’t expecting a reply as he continued nonchalantly.

 

“When I was a child, my father took me there to broaden my horizons.”

 



 

“I didn’t expect much, but the farm’s scale was impressive. The green fields stretched endlessly to the horizon.”

 

Her head felt heavy and dizzy. Could a single sip of whiskey make her drunk? Lisbell curled up inwardly. Ulrich persistently stuck to the back of her head, following her like a caterpillar. Occasionally, he stretched out his arms and pulled her curly hair.

 

“While my father was meeting the farm owner, I wandered around, exploring the outdoors. Do you know what amazed me the most?”

 

I don’t know.

 

And I don’t want to.

 

One sip had made her mind feel loose, while this man’s pronunciation and speech were perfectly intact. Was this rambling a drunken behavior? I don’t know. I just don’t want to know.

 

“It was the cotton field. It was a hot season like now, and the cotton bolls were in full bloom.”

 



 

“The white bolls looked as if snow had fallen in summer.”

 

What he said kept reminding her of someone, making it harder to kill her consciousness.

 

Theodore, who was born as the son of a textile factory owner. He, too, often talked about the farms and cotton fields in his hometown, just like Ulrich was doing now.

 

Thinking of Theodore while being entwined naked with another man on the bed made her feel disgusted with herself.

 

“Lisbell’s hair feels like the cotton bolls I held then.”

 



 

“It’s a cute texture…”

 

The slight intoxication and the heavy drowsiness combined, and her mind was completely dazed. She wished the sound would slowly fade, but unfortunately, everything was clearly audible. It was exhausting.

 

The words she just heard were something Theodore had once said.

 

He had told her that her naturally curly hair often tangled and was annoying to manage, but he found it cute like a cloud. Her fiancé had once uttered such ticklish words.

 

Now, hearing Ulrich dirty those words Theodore had once said, while mentioning things that reminded her of Theodore, made her feel cursed.

 

Her loosening mind gradually lost strength.

 

Just before falling asleep, she envisioned Theodore’s radiant smile towards her like the sun. In her fading consciousness, she ran into his arms.

 

A mirage-like sensation that would disappear the moment she grasped it.

 



 

Swoosh-

 

Twisting both ends of a soaked towel, water droplets fell refreshingly. Lisbell, who watched it silently, folded the towel twice, leaving it with just enough moisture. Then, she carefully wiped her mother’s arm that was sticking out from under the blanket.

 

If only her mother’s eyelids would flutter even once, she would have no more wishes, but her mother’s face remained as serene as always, continuing her quiet sleep.

 

After the surgery, Mrs. Osborne had been transported to this villa the moment Lisbell signed the contract. Now, in this cozy bedroom, she received lavish care beyond their means.

 

Under normal circumstances, such expensive medicine being administered morning and night, and the personal physician of the Altahart family coming to Marnia to check on her daily, would be unimaginable.

 

But even in such a perfect environment, her mother showed no sign of waking up. Lisbell’s days passed by caring for her mother. Except for the times when Ulrich summoned her to his bedroom, she spent all her time here.



Lisbell stared blankly at her mother, who lay as if only her body remained, devoid of her soul.

 

“…Mother.”

 

Knowing there would be no response, she still opened her mouth. Her parched and cracked voice, a testament to her broken expectations, echoed in the beautiful yet desolate room before fading away.

 

Lisbell hesitated again as she moved her hand, which had paused for a moment.

 

Why didn’t you tell me?

 

If her mother were to regain consciousness, that was the first question she wanted to ask. It simmered with many emotions.

 

There was guilt for not recognizing the condition of her only family member, relief that her mother had survived in some way, and, on the other hand… a thinly veiled question of why her mother hadn’t informed her earlier, leaving her to be caught like a hostage in a man’s grasp.

 

Lisbell, lost in thought, shook her head.

 

The strange thoughts made her shrink back. Almost scolding herself, she diligently continued to clean her mother’s body.

 

Her mother’s frame, usually hidden beneath clothes, was emaciated. It was like a fragile straw that couldn’t withstand the harsh winter winds.

 

Lisbell bit the inside of her cheek and quickly pulled down her mother’s dress.

 

After making a round of the bed to clean her mother, she sat back in the chair. She hung the now dry towel over the basin and picked up a book she had taken from the study.

 

Opening to the page she had left off, she cleared her throat. She worried that her hoarse voice from the previous night’s distress might sound unpleasant to her mother.

 

Even though her mother was unconscious, Lisbell wanted her to know she was there, so she always read aloud quietly. Today was no different. Her slightly husky voice filled the silent room like a constant background noise.

 

She was about to turn a page full of lines of text.

 

Late summer wind blew through the open window. Her loose ash-gray hair swayed gently.

 

Lisbell lifted her eyes from the book.

 

The midday sun blazed fiercely in the sky. At such moments, Lisbell often felt dazed. She was engulfed in thoughts, wondering what she was doing in such a peaceful scene.

 

Really, what am I doing now?

 

Although she was sitting upright, it felt like she was faltering like someone who had lost their balance. As she realized that the previously stifling hot wind of Marnia no longer felt so intense, she felt more disoriented.

 

The realization that the summer she had once eagerly awaited was passing by so meaninglessly deepened this feeling.

 

Knock, knock.

 

An unexpected knock approached like an unwelcome guest.

 

Lisbell hurriedly turned to the door. Ulrich, whose appearance she hadn’t noticed, was leaning against the door with his arms crossed.

 

It felt strangely surreal for him to be in her mother’s bedroom. During the week she spent caring for her mother, he had never shown his face here.

 

She didn’t know the reason, but she was just grateful. She no longer wanted to be in the same space with him and her mother. The frustration from the hospital room, which had been so brightly lit that she felt even more insignificant, still lingered deeply within her.

 

“You were here.”

 

His tone was monotonous, as if it were obvious she was there.

 

Lisbell closed the book and stood up. Even though he hadn’t completely entered the room, it felt uncomfortable for the three of them to be together.

 

“You have a visitor, Lisbell.”

 

As she was about to leave and ask about the visitor, Ulrich spoke first.

 

Visitor?

 

Noticing her puzzled look, he added with a smile.

 

“Theodore Motier.”

 

Lisbell’s steps halted abruptly. Ulrich tilted his head, not taking his eyes off her face. Leaning against the wooden door, he continued to smile enigmatically.

 

“Your fiancé is here.”

 

As Lisbell stood frozen in disbelief, Ulrich knocked on the door again. The knocking sound seemed like a command to snap her out of her daze.

 

Finally, Lisbell, whose vision was blurred, muttered.

 

“Theo… is here?”

 

“Yes.”

 



 

“I’ve instructed him to wait in the drawing room.”

 

Theodore was… in the drawing room, in this villa. Her fiancé was in the same city, the same area, the same building. What should have been an exciting prospect felt eerily disturbing. Lisbell unconsciously rubbed her arm.

 

“Are you going to meet him?”

 



 

“If not, I’ll send him away.”

 

“Noi”

 

She hastily grabbed Ulrich as he interpreted her silence and turned to leave.

 

“I can’t… just send him away…”

 

She quickly understood why Theodore had come all the way here. If it had been her, she would have done the same. If he had suddenly left saying he had an urgent matter and then only sent a message to postpone the wedding, she would have done the same. So, there was no need to ponder why he was here. The answer was in her actions.

 

Ulrich watched Lisbell in silence. His dry gaze, like sand in the desert, did not waver from her confused face.

 

He soon smiled subtly and entered the bedroom.

 

“Alright, then let’s meet him.”

 

Lisbell backed away as he approached. But Ulrich, with his long strides, caught her arm first.

 

Without a moment to react, she was dragged and seated somewhere. It was the vanity table that stood like a decoration in a corner of the room.

 

“Ouch…”

 

As his hands suddenly dug into her scalp, Lisbell reflexively bit her lip. Her loose ash-gray hair, now untied, gathered under his skillful hands.

 

He combed through the stray hairs and tidied the messy parts before loosening the tie around his neck.

 

Just before summer, he had often left his shirt buttons open freely. But at some point, he had started wearing ties, mostly black ones, similar to the one Lisbell had once given him as a gift. Lisbell decided not to care about him anymore.

 

Ulrich gently untied his tie and used it to tie Lisbell’s hair.

 

“It looks much better.”

 

Was it because her unruly hair was now neatly tied, or because the tie he used was his own? His ambiguous words were puzzling.

 

Lisbell’s uneasy expression was reflected in the mirror.

 

“You know where the drawing room is, right?”

 

He grabbed Lisbell’s ponytail and kissed the nape of her white neck.

 

Their eyes met in the mirror.

 

His eyes were like a blue chain. The feeling of being bound tightly, just by looking, could only be described this way.

 

It could be an unconscious manifestation. The guilt she felt toward Theodore made her feel remorse just by facing those eyes.

 

As her entanglements with Ulrich increased, the secrets she couldn’t share with Theodore weighed her down like a heavy burden. Since arriving at this villa, she had never felt light-hearted or free from worry.

 

“Please, enjoy your time with your fiancé.”

 

Leaving behind these oddly elusive words, he exited the bedroom.

 

Lisbell, left alone, still couldn’t move. Her face in the mirror looked as pale as a sheet. She sat there, unable to do anything, until the church bells tolled, filling the entire villa with their sound. Finally, she managed to get up.

 

Because Theodore was waiting.

 

As the twelfth bell rang, Lisbell arrived in front of the drawing room.

 

Standing in front of the closed door, she couldn’t describe her feelings. The drawing room was where everything had begun. She had come to apologize on behalf of her mother for a crime she hadn’t committed….

 

Lisbell closed her eyes tightly and gently placed her hand on the door. Then she slowly pushed it open.

 

The drawing room in the afternoon was filled with small rays of light. In the wavering sunlit waves, someone stood up abruptly. The simple gesture conveyed feelings of joy, surprise, longing, and tenderness.

 

No, perhaps it was her own feelings.

 

“…Lisbelli”

 

It was no wonder, for her fiancé, who had always been like a mirage, was now truly in front of her.

* * *


It was Theodore.

 

It wasn’t a dream, but the reality of him.

 

Unable to believe it, Lisbell stood by the door for a long time, unable to react. Theodore couldn’t just stand there quietly watching. As soon as the door opened and Lisbell’s face appeared, he ran over and grabbed his fiancée’s hand.

 

“Lisbell.”

 

Warmth spread from where he touched her. Despite the season, the warmth that had somehow been elusive, felt like summer. This brought her dulled senses back to life.

 

“Theo. How did you get here…?”

 

“Of course, I came to see you.”

 



 

“I couldn’t accept that one phone call telling me you wanted to postpone the wedding. So, I came to ask you directly.”

 

Theodore suggested they sit down and led Lisbell into the drawing room.

 

At the end of the hallway, the unchanged sofa from the past greeted her. The memories of what happened here came back, making her stop instinctively. Fortunately, the reaction was so slight that Theodore didn’t notice.

 

In front of Theodore was a cup of coffee, seemingly prepared for a guest. There was no steam rising from it, suggesting it had gone cold, and it looked like he hadn’t taken a single sip. This reflected Theodore’s anxious state, causing her heart to ache.

 



 



 

She never imagined such a moment would come while being with Theodore. Holding hands, sitting close enough for their knees to touch, looking into each other’s eyes but unable to speak easily, feeling the awkwardness first and foremost.

 

The atmosphere was tense, unlike a couple who had promised to marry. Lisbell didn’t know how to break the silence and looked down slightly. She stared at the back of Theodore’s hand, tightly holding hers.

 

“Lisbell, look at me.”

 

“…Okay.”

 

What will he ask first?

 

Why are you here?

 

What exactly happened suddenly?

 

What’s the exact reason for postponing the wedding?

 

There were so many questions she couldn’t guess. And it saddened her that she couldn’t guess.

 

When she first saw Theodore, she felt like she had finally woken up from a nightmare. But now, stepping out of that shattered dream, a reality where she couldn’t take a single step forward awaited her like a beast with its jaws wide open.

 

All that remained was to be swallowed up.

 

So, she wanted to turn around and run away….

 

“Did you have something to eat?”

 

Among the many expected questions, Theodore asked something completely unexpected.

 

Lisbell doubted her ears for a moment. But the next moment proved there was nothing wrong. The familiar smile on Theodore’s face and his comforting hand caressing her cheek were evidence.

 

“You seem to have lost some weight. Your complexion doesn’t look good…. Are you eating well?”

 

“Theo.”

 

“Are you sick?”

 

As the affectionate questions continued, Lisbell felt herself breaking down bit by bit. The many fears that fueled her avoidance gradually subsided, leaving only a strong yearning.

 

Yes, Theodore was this kind of person.

 

She loved him because she knew his nature and this type of kindness. No, she still loved him. His kindness, which made her lean on him whenever something tough happened, hadn’t changed despite the uncertain situation.

 

“No, Theo. I’m fine. So don’t worry.”

 

“Really?”

 

“Yes, really…”

 



 

“I’m sorry. For making you come all the way here.”

 

“You don’t need to apologize. I came on my own.”

 

Lisbell leaned into the palm caressing her cheek and closed her eyes. Something lightly touched and then left her forehead. She knew it was his lips without even seeing.

 

They were officially engaged. Despite that, Theodore’s cautious and tender behavior contrasted sharply with someone who had treated her worse than a discarded toy.

 

“Lisbell… Is there something wrong with your mother?”

 

Before coming to the drawing room, she recalled wiping her arms and legs with a towel.

 

Even covered with soft bedding, her emaciated body and deathly pale complexion, almost devoid of any warmth, made her worry if she had already stopped breathing.

 

“No matter how much I think about it, I can’t guess anything else. Lisbell, you always think and worry about your mother, no matter where you are. If there’s nothing wrong with her, then you wouldn’t be acting like this.”

 

“Theo.”

 

“Tell me. Is something wrong with your mother?”

 



 

“Even if it’s not that, if something is troubling you, don’t hide it from me and tell me.”

 

What’s troubling me?

 

It’s this villa where we’re together right now.

 

Facing you like this in this prison-like place is unbearable.

 

So many visible things are pressing and weighing me down.

 

For example, the pavilion in the garden over your shoulder, the memories of crouching in this drawing room without feeling sunlight, even the tie that feels like it’s gripping my hair….

 

Because of all that, even the time spent with Theodore couldn’t be separated from the man. And that was the very hardship Theodore was painfully curious about.

 

Theodore suddenly clasped her hands.

 

“Lisbell,” he whispered softly, his voice full of sorrow. Through her tear-blurred vision, she saw Theodore gritting his teeth.

 

“Damn it. Something did happen, didn’t it? Why are you crying? Tell me what happened. I need to know. Okay?”

 



 

“This is just my guess, but… coming to Marnia, not answering about your mother…. Is it related to that man?”

 

Theodore continuously wiped her silent tears with his palm. He didn’t realize what kind of misunderstanding he was creating, but his face grew increasingly serious.

 

“Is it? It’s related to that man, the owner of this villa, isn’t it?”

 



 

“Is it a financial issue?”

 

Lisbell involuntarily curled her shoulders. Theodore, who was fully focused on her, couldn’t miss the change. His face hardened further. Certain he was right, Theodore resolutely grabbed her shoulders.

 

“I’ll help you, Lisbell.”

 



 

“I’ll help you.”

 

“What….”

 

“I’ll find a way to raise money. Even if we have to delay the wedding, I’ll gather as much as I can. If that’s not enough… I can contact my parents in Renbruck.”

 



 

“I heard my father recently signed a new farm and supply contract. I was worried about the sudden investment amount, but the broker who introduced the farm seems to be reputable. He trusted the investment, so once the contract is done, the factory sales will increase effectively in the first half of the year. If that happens, helping you won’t be difficult.”

 



 

“Lisbell, we promised to share our future. That naturally includes situations like this. You don’t have to handle everything alone.”

 

At that moment, she could read the responsibility in his eyes. Theodore wasn’t pretending. He was sincere. He genuinely dreamt of a future with Lisbell and was extending his hand to solve the difficulties she faced.

 

The hand she always thought was like a mirage was now a reality she could grasp right in front of her.

 

Lisbell stared at it blankly.

 

She believed she should never rely on him. She didn’t want to drag Theodore into this valley of misfortune, feeling like a cutting north wind at every turn. She firmly believed that was how she protected her love.

 

But he had come, he offered to help, and he was extending his hand.

 

The days she endured in this cruel and lonely space flashed quickly. The more she counted the tough and anxious days, the harder it was to ignore his hand.

 

Should I take it?

 

If I hold this hand, can I escape this valley of misfortune that won’t let go?

 

Hope, thought to be faded and blurred, surged anew, pulsing through her body.

 

Lisbell met Theodore’s eyes. She grimaced, unable to hold back the sob rising from deep inside.

 

“I, I….”

 

Her lips were just about to open.

 

Bangi

 

A gunshot echoed through the drawing room.


The lingering echo left by the sound was extremely sharp and intense. It felt like a drill boring into the brain. It was evidenced by the figures of the two people, frozen solid. Their pupils, containing only each other, trembled as if swept away by the wind.

 

Bangi

 

A gunshot rang out again.

 

The sound was so sudden and startling that it felt as if someone had fired a gun right next to their ears. But it wasn’t so. Only now, a little late, did the sense of distance set in. The space was strictly separated. The gunshot came from outside the window.

 

“What is it…?”

 

Theodore, seemingly just as bewildered, looked towards the window with a dazed expression. Seeing him react this way confirmed that the sound indeed came from outside.

 

So this space remained unharmed, but Lisbell felt overwhelmed as if she had been struck by it.

 

A moment from the past fiercely resurfaced.

 

The savage gunfire that suddenly assaulted the senses while walking down a hallway, just like now. When she peeked outside the window, startled, there was a man aiming at a target in a textbook-perfect stance.

 

“Is someone practicing shooting?”

 



 

“Lisbell?”

 

Theodore’s voice was intermittently cut off because the gunshots still invaded this space. He squinted one eye as if the noise was bothersome. Lisbell, looking at his face, thought of just one thing.

 

After the continuous gunfire sounds, the target board seen in a flash…

 

The pitiful target board, damaged almost perfectly with only the center deeply pitted as if hit every time.

 

Cold sweat trickled down her spine. She felt another chill. The brief summer she had reclaimed was quickly ebbing away like a receding tide. The season was breaking down again.

 

Even amidst this, the continuing gunfire sounded just like Ulrich’s sneering laughter, mocking her. It felt like the sound wasn’t just tearing at her ears but at her heart as well. Recalling his trivial stories she had half-listened to in the past.

 

“Do you know the large farm in Crimpford?”

 

“It was the cotton field. It was a hot season like now, and the cotton bolls were in full bloom.”

 

The topic that used to torment her by associating it with Theodore, so much that she wanted to pass out by forcefully pushing herself to drink, now prickled her sharply for no apparent reason.

 

“Lisbell, this sound….”

 

“Theo.”

 

“What?”

 

Theodore, stretching his neck to figure out where the sound was coming from, looked back at her. Lisbell saw a peculiar seed of despair in his face.

 

“Your father, the farm he newly contracted this time… is it the large farm in Crimpford?”

 

Theodore’s eyes widened.

 

“Yes. How did you know?”

 

Ah.

 

Ah.

 

Ah….

 

The myriad of thoughts occupying her mind scattered. The gunfire, which had been ringing in her ears like tinnitus, ceased. But Lisbell still felt as if she could hear something. Thump, thump, thump. A blunt but heavier throbbing than the gunfire hammered down her entire body like an ax.

 

She realized only a moment later.

 

It was her own heartbeat.

 

Even though the space was clearly separated, making it seem like only the savage sound was transmitted, it wasn’t so. Lisbell was surely torn apart by that gunfire. Anxiety and unease surged in like a black wave through the cracks of her shattered mind.

 

My misfortune has finally transferred to my fiancé.

 

When did it start?

 

The misfortune that swallowed me was now preparing to engulf my fiancé as well.

 

A shiver ran through her entire body.

 

“…Lisbell? Lisbelli”

 

Unable to bear it, she hunched forward, clutching her head. Her fingertips brushed against the frustratingly soft material of a necktie. Lisbell yanked at it neurotically, like someone screaming silently.

 

Her ponytail, leaving a mark, messily cascaded down. She looked at the necktie in her hand in despair.

 

Staring at the black necktie stretching horizontally across her eyes, Lisbell unconsciously grabbed her neck.

 

Her cautious movements gradually turned pathological.

 

Even though nothing was hanging there, she scratched furiously at her white skin until red drops of blood appeared. She was picking at her skin so much that flesh clung to her nails, but the panic splitting her mind was so dominant that she didn’t have time to feel the pain of her skin tearing.

 

“Ah….”

 

Then realization hit her in an instant.

 

It wasn’t just about the money.

 

Even if that were resolved, everything couldn’t be undone as if it never happened.

 

He meant for me to come to him willingly.

 

By betraying the trust with my dear fiancé and going to him directly.

 

Lisbell had already committed the act of betraying this relationship. She had done it. There was even an excuse. She did it to save her mother. She thought she had no choice at the time.

 

And that incident had very clearly turned into her weakness. The leash of this secret was in Ulrich’s hands. That’s why she kept feeling something was tied around her neck.

 

“Ha….”

 

“Lisbell? Are you alright?”

 

“Haha….”

 

A hollow laugh slipped out.

 

“Why? Are you in pain? Is it your head? Does your head hurt?”

 

She no longer felt any warmth from her fiancé’s careful touch. No warmth at all; even if she were at the bottom of a cold ocean, it wouldn’t be as chilling as this. The uncontrollable cold surged as if she had become a living ice block.

 

The trap that had taken her as its prey was silently laid at her feet.

 

As intricate as a spider’s web, as precise as a chessboard….

 

Her foolish self had stepped into it willingly, unaware, step by step. She didn’t even realize it when it was finally wrapped around her neck.

 

Going forward was checkmate, going backward was checkmate.

 

In chess, this was called a mate.

 

Yes, I’m exactly in that state now….

 

In a disheveled state, Lisbell stared blankly into space. Even in this moment, Theodore’s tender hand, with no fault to find, caressed her cheek as he called her name soothingly, “Lisbell,” and brushed back her tousled hair.

 

Feeling his touch silently, Lisbell slowly turned her head.

 

“Theo.”

 

“I’m listening. Tell me.”

 

“…Will you break off the engagement?”

 

The tender hand that had been stroking her sideburns as if prepared to accept anything froze. Lisbell, if she could, wanted to lean her cheek against that palm once more. But she couldn’t anymore. She realized too painfully that she couldn’t anymore.

 

“Now….”

 

“I asked you to break off our engagement.”

 



 

“Let’s break up, Theo.”

 

Holding onto Theodore any longer wasn’t love but obstinacy. As someone who loved him, she couldn’t commit such an ugly selfish act. It was clear that the path ahead couldn’t be a bed of roses, at least not for him, now that she had understood the underlying issues.

 

So this was the right thing to do.

 

It should have been like this from the beginning.

 

Driven by the desire to keep at least one thing within reach, she had done something she shouldn’t have. If she couldn’t correct it now, at least Theodore should be freed from this shadow.

 

She didn’t want to imagine the moment when the swamp holding her down would swallow even his ankles. So the answer was clear.

 

“What are you saying?”

 



 

“Why, why does it have to end like this? Just a moment ago….”

 

Holding her shoulders gently but firmly, Theodore, his face hardening, opened his eyes wide.

 

“You’re doing this on purpose, aren’t you?”

 



 

“You’re saying this because you don’t want to cause me any harm, aren’t you? You don’t mean it, right?”

 

His attitude was unusually earnest, and perhaps he was right; it contained a strong denial. A denial driven by his desperate belief that they couldn’t end like this, that she felt the same way.

 

And it wasn’t just words. His wavering eyes, the way he clasped his hands over hers on her lap, everything expressed his blind desire to confirm the solidity of their relationship.

 

“Theo….”

 

“Say it isn’t true.”

 



 

“Say it was a slip of the tongue.”

 



 

“Lisbell, it’s alright. I told you just a moment ago. You don’t have to feel guilty. It’s all on me. It’s my choice, my decision. So you shouldn’t feel any burden….”

 

This was the second time.

 

Facing a situation where she had no choice but to make a foolish decision, knowing it was wrong.

 

“I don’t love you anymore.”

 



 

“That’s why, Theo.”


Theodore was frozen in place. The news must have been that shocking.

 

In contrast, Lisbell remained calm. For the first time, she realized how easy it was to lie. By simply stripping away her emotions and reciting plausible words that came to mind, it wasn’t that difficult. Above all, she believed this was the best path for Theodore.

 

Now that she had realized this was the best course of action.

 

“You don’t love me…?”

 

His eyes, which had been turbulent, soon regained focus.

 

“Don’t lie.”

 

“It’s not a lie.”

 

“No, it is a lie.”

 



 

“I know you. Have I only known you for a year? As much as you’ve seen me, I’ve seen you too, Lisbell.”

 

Lisbell turned her head to avoid his gaze. Then Theodore got off the sofa and knelt down in front of her, trying to look into her face. She wanted to avoid it, but knowing that avoiding it more would only increase his suspicion, Lisbell remained still as if she were a stone.

 

Theodore scrutinized her small face deeply and closely.

 

“…Why?”

 



 

“Why are you saying such things…?”

 

“They say there are no reasons when love begins.”

 



 

“I think it’s the same when it ends.”

 

Trying to appear as if she had made a difficult decision, Lisbell brushed her face once.

 

“I was confused too, facing this right before the wedding, so I needed some quiet time to think. But seeing you come all the way here… I now have an unshakable certainty. I don’t feel any excitement when I see you anymore.”

 

“Lies.”

 

“It’s not a lie.”

 

“Lies…”

 

His resolute consciousness began to waver.

 

Believing that Lisbell had no reason to hide such things from him, the cruel excuse she presented seemed to validate all her actions.

 

The sudden departure, the rude notification to delay the wedding via phone, and the awkward behavior when they finally met here…

 

“I know this shouldn’t have been avoided in this way. But the time we spent together was precious to me too. That’s why I was scared and afraid of the moment when I would have to tell you this…”

 

Lisbell drove the nail into his collapse.

 



 

Theodore finally looked speechless. The grip on Lisbell’s hand, which he held as if it were a lifeline, had weakened considerably. Lisbell quietly looked down at his hand, which had always felt reassuring. It seemed like she was trying to capture the warmth she would never feel again.

 

“…Then what about your mother?”

 



 

“There must be something wrong with her. I’m sorry, Lisbell, but I can’t help but think that your sudden change is because of her.”

 

“My mother is perfectly fine. Theo, she’s as healthy as ever, your worries were for nothing.”

 

“Then why did you come to Marnia?”

 



 

“You said you needed time to think? But why did it have to be here? Isn’t it because your mother is here? And wasn’t it because something happened to her? If nothing’s wrong with her, then why, why did you pack up and come here all of a sudden? Why here…”

 

His voice had grown slightly harsh. It was a sign that his denial was fading and a faint disappointment that the story might be true was beginning to settle in. Negative emotions always tend to spread quickly. The small bud of pessimism in Theodore would surely follow that trend.

 

“No way…”

 



 

“Then did you come to see that man?”

 

His misunderstanding was clear. Lisbell didn’t respond. She knew it was time to nurture his misunderstanding, not correct it.

 

Saying it wasn’t true would only nullify all the effort she had put into uttering each painful word.

 

She couldn’t say it twice. If she did, she would end up pathetically begging him not to leave her, confessing it was all a lie.

 

So she endured it. Misunderstanding her relationship with Ulrich in that way was excruciatingly painful, but if it was the way to save Theodore, she had to endure it.

 

“No, right?”

 



 

“Say no, Lisbell.”

 



 

“Please, just say no…”

 

The shock and fear that his fiancée might have another man just before their wedding finally broke Theodore down.

 

Lisbell couldn’t bear to look at him resting his face on her knee. Even so, she could tell he was crying. She felt the hem of her skirt getting wet where his face touched it.

 

The traces of tears gathering like puddles in this place, where it didn’t rain, felt like tears he was shedding for her.

 

The simple and kind-hearted Theodore Motier.

 

“I wish you always happiness.”

 

This is sincere…

 

Swallowing back the words she couldn’t bring herself to say, Lisbell looked out the window. Her eyes, reflecting the slightly subdued sunlight, grew as dull as those of a living corpse.

 



 

She didn’t see Theodore off as he left.

 

She just sat silently in the drawing room for as long as it would take for him to leave the villa and go far away.

 

The shadows of the afternoon, now more sharply angled, cast a shape that seemed to cut at her feet. She stared blankly into space as if unable to escape from those shadows.

 

What is this feeling?

 

What is this strangely calm feeling?

 

Even though she wanted to hold onto him and believed she had no hope otherwise, had she been mentally preparing herself for the moment they would part?

 

Oh, is it resignation?

 

Yes, this feeling of a desolate heart with no will left must be resignation. It was a new emotion to her, and though fascinating, it wasn’t welcoming.

 

Lisbell, who had been as silent as a pillar for a long time, finally stood up quietly. Leaving the drawing room, she headed to her mother’s bedroom to return to her routine.

 

Her mother looked exactly the same as before she had left.

 

What would Theodore have done if he had seen her mother like this?

 

He would have hugged her tightly right away.

 

And he would have said something like this:

 

“You’ve been suffering alone, haven’t you?”

 

“Why didn’t you tell me?”

 

“Lisbell, don’t try to bear it all alone.”

 

“I’m here with you.”

 

Just imagining it made it seem like his voice was really there. It was because she had heard those words before. It was the comfort he had given her every time she was struggling, the comfort she trusted and followed.

 

The more she reminisced about him, the more she felt she had made the right decision.

 

While sitting silently in the drawing room, Lisbell had envisioned the future with Theodore as if recalling an unfulfilled dream.

 

The imagination started from the point where she told him the truth.

 

Theodore would probably have run around tirelessly to solve the financial problems, just as he had said. She might have helped him, and the problem could have been resolved more smoothly than expected.

 

The real problem would come afterward.

 

Ulrich, who found her amusing to play with, would use the farm contract as leverage to threaten Theodore’s family. That would bring chaos far beyond the current financial issues. It was about the survival of the factory that his father had built.

 

After resolving that, Ulrich would directly pull the invisible leash he had placed around her neck. He would force her to confess that she had betrayed Theodore and was humiliated under Ulrich.

 

Ironically, the scariest part of her imagination was here.

 

Lisbell’s fear lay there.

 

External pressures and threats could be overcome together. But if distrust was sown from within, breaking their trust and faith in each other, the end would be unpredictable.

 

If that truth was exposed and Theodore abandoned her because of it, she wouldn’t be able to bear it. That fear and horror drove her to let him go first. It was cowardly avoidance, but still, but still…

 

Lisbell imagined the end with him breaking multiple times. Repeating it until Theodore left the villa, she endured it in the same place.

 

If she hadn’t done that, she would have chased after him, telling him not to cry and caressing his cheek.


Lisbell sat down in the chair and opened a book.

 

She calmly resumed reading from where she left off. Her voice flowed smoothly through the first and second lines but faltered on the third. The quiet sound was swallowed by the stillness of the bedroom.

 

After a brief silence, Lisbell started reading again from that part. Yet again, she stumbled. Trying to pretend nothing was wrong, she resumed speaking but soon faltered again.

 



 

Taking her eyes off the book, she looked at her mother’s hand, neatly placed on the blanket. She closed the book, set it down, and stood up to grasp it. Even though she knew it was too frail for her to hold, she couldn’t endure without doing so.

 

“Mother.”

 

No answer came back.

 

She felt disappointed despite not expecting a response.

 

“Did I make the right decision?”

 

It didn’t matter if it wasn’t her mother. She wanted to hear an answer from anyone.

 

“Please, tell me I did.”

 

That I didn’t make the wrong decision.

 

“Please….”

 

Tell me that this regret I’m feeling now is misplaced.

 

Holding her mother’s hand, she sank to the floor and lowered her head. The tears she had held back in front of Theodore now streamed down uncontrollably.

 

Regret always came too late, hitting her with an overwhelming force. Lisbell couldn’t resist it and was buried in it.

 

After crying until her knees on the floor were damp, dizziness washed over her. She leaned her dizzy head against the bed and then slowly stood up.

 

She didn’t want to show such a miserable sight by her mother’s side, not knowing when she might wake up. If her mother, encouraged by her hope, were to wake and see her daughter’s face like this, it would break her heart.

 

Rationalizing that she needed to take a break from caregiving for the day, Lisbell tidied up.

 

In that short time, her swollen eyelids stung every time she blinked. This made her think of Theodore. He must have cried just as much. No, probably even more. His eyes must have stung terribly…. Lisbell bit her lip at the thought that made her heart ache.

 

Today, she wanted to hide in a corner where no one could see her. She wanted to lie in bed, pull the blanket over her head, and sleep as if tomorrow would never come. With such gloomy thoughts, she left the bedroom.

 

She was heading down the hallway to her room when a slightly open bedroom door caught her attention. What drew her attention was not the now familiar interior design or the overwhelming furnishings.

 



 

There was a drink table, as always. A sleek liquor bottle was on it. The type of liquor often changed, apparently according to Ulrich’s taste, but what she saw now was the same one Ulrich had drunk a few days ago.

 

The reason Lisbell noticed it, despite her preoccupied mind, was simple. She remembered the strange exhilaration from that day, when just one glass made her feel as if her brain was relaxing and her body melting away. The taste was awful, but the effect was remarkable.

 

What she needed now was not something else but that effect to escape this oppressive regret.

 

When the thought crossed her mind, her feet had already crossed the bedroom threshold.

 



 

“All duds, as expected.”

 

Ulrich took off his leather gloves, disliking the strong smell of gunpowder, and made a dissatisfied face. Victor, who had been standing a bit further away, approached with an expected look and nodded.

 

While Victor tidied up the firearms, Ulrich turned his head and gazed into the distance, seemingly looking at a specific place at the villa entrance, although it was unclear exactly where.

 

Victor signaled the household staff, who had come out to wait, to tidy up and quickly followed Ulrich.

 

“I’ve sent out the invitations as per the list you provided last time. Once the trial operation is over, we plan to hold the opening ceremony. We’ll prepare the reception party in three parts, similar to the opening of Hotel No. 1.”

 

“Yes, do that.”

 

“I’ve also drafted a speech, but it would be good for you to review it. After all, you’ll be delivering it.”

 

Ulrich’s shoulders slightly rose and fell as he walked ahead. Though Victor could only see his back, he could vividly imagine the sigh on Ulrich’s face.

 

“So, the day has finally come to go to the capital.”

 

“Please endure it for just a few days.”

 

“Just make sure neither Mother nor Gwen gets anywhere near me.”

 

How can they not come, given it’s a family-run business….

 

The thought was obvious, but Victor kept it to himself, knowing Ulrich would loathe it. Getting Ulrich to the capital hotel for the opening ceremony was essential from his standpoint.

 

Having finished all the business matters, it was now time to address personal concerns. Victor put down the notebook he had been holding.

 

“Just to be cautious… have you been taking your medicine, sir?”

 

“Medicine?”

 

“Or administering it.”

 

Ulrich, walking ahead, paused momentarily before realizing Victor’s intent and let out a short laugh.

 

“Neither.”

 

The assistant was referring to the measures to prevent a child from being conceived through his affairs with Lisbell. Ulrich thought Victor was exceptionally meticulous. It was indeed a fundamental part of the education for anyone stepping into this family business.

 

“I don’t finish inside anyway.”

 

It was quite uncomfortable having to listen to such personal matters, but thanks to past experience, Victor had developed the resilience not to flinch.

 

“One can never be too careful.”

 

“Indeed.”

 

“It’s an issue that can’t be taken too lightly.”

 

Absolutely.

 

In high society, where bloodline succession was crucial, the issue of heirs was always a hot topic. It could be a result of tender love or a product of terrible infidelity. Such stories would fuel the scandals that would brighten up Laurent’s social season more than spring flowers.

 

This issue’s magnitude was even greater in larger, more prestigious families. The Altahart family, with their historically poor sense of propriety, had faced this problem numerous times.

 

Blood could be a powerful bond, a weapon, and a form of power in the face of a prestigious name.

 

According to the ancestors’ rule that only those bearing the family blood could inherit the name and the business rights, a wrongly conceived child could potentially consume the entire family.

 

Therefore, Ulrich did not welcome the idea of children.

 

He didn’t want to bear the risk of producing a child just for a night’s pleasure. He didn’t want to create a life from a brief moment of sweetness if it meant bearing that much risk and responsibility.

 

Victor had developed a tolerance for Ulrich’s personal life because he had handled such matters many times. When Ulrich had a regular female companion, Victor would ensure she took contraceptives, and if she seemed particularly untrustworthy, he would recommend Ulrich to take them. They both agreed that a child shouldn’t be conceived carelessly, and Ulrich never resisted taking the medication.

 

“By the way, is that kid still at the main house?”

 

Victor nodded, understanding who Ulrich meant.

 

“Yes, he is.”

 

“How’s he doing?”

 

“Well….”

 

Even a polite response of “well” didn’t come easily. Ulrich, expecting this, let out a resigned chuckle.

 

“Gwen Altahart, of course.”

 



 

“Taking in an illegitimate child and then getting involved with another one… utterly irresponsible.”

 

Victor had some bad news about Gwen. However, it was a sensitive issue that the family was strictly controlling, so even he had to be cautious. Ulrich would find out when he went to the capital anyway.

 

There was no need to bring forward something that would soon cause a headache. Victor decided to keep quiet.

 

“Well, luck might have prevented a child so far, but there’s no guarantee for the future.”

 



 

“From now on, mix the medicine into Lisbell’s meals.”

 

I don’t want a child.

 

That was the implication in his brief order.


“More importantly, the guest?” 

 

Ulrich casually asked as he opened the door to the office they had arrived at. Victor followed behind and closed the door. He glanced towards the office window.

 

“He has left.”

 

“And the send-off?”

 

“As per your instructions, I had a driver ready to take him to the station, but he declined and left the villa alone. The driver said he looked like he was about to cry.”

 

Ulrich, who was about to light a cigarette as he sat down, paused in thought and then quietly laughed.

 

“What is Lisbell doing?”

 

“I heard she is in the drawing room.”

 

“Still?”

 

“Yes.”

 

His smile deepened.

 

“One side is propping up a pitiful pride, while the other is just sitting there without even seeing him off…”

 

Just by their attitudes, the situation was clear. Ulrich, humming contentedly, shuffled through the papers. Victor, watching him, quietly clicked his tongue. He recalled some of the absurd instructions he had silently followed as Ulrich’s secretary.

 

Bribing the Marnia police to send letters about a non-existent incident, investigating an unrelated factory owner in another city, or suddenly driving off to Misley in the east and then returning…

 

He now knew well that a woman was at the end of all those paths.

 

Lisbell Osborne.

 

The daughter of Mrs. Osborne, who once managed this villa, and now, essentially Ulrich’s mistress. He didn’t know when it started, but she had firmly caught Ulrich Altahart’s interest.

 

No matter how many times he thought about it, it was pitiful. How did she catch this madman’s attention? What strange thing had she done?

 

Then his thoughts shifted.

 

No.

 

She might not have done anything peculiar. One must not overlook the fact that this boss was crazy. Madmen are unpredictable because they get hooked on strange points. If he had been capable of rational thought, he would have long been repulsed by the Altahart name and left it.

 

Ulrich seemed to consider himself one of the more normal members of his family, but Victor saw it differently. Based on the obstinacy and persistence he showed in incidents, he was the most extreme among his family.

 

Knowing when to give up was also a skill. But Ulrich couldn’t accept that.

 

He was the type to keep going until he succeeded. He would use everything he had to achieve his goal, even if it meant breaking someone’s spirit. And he felt no guilt about it.

 

That was the essence and dark side of Altahart that no one could deny. Ulrich too, despite his noble name, hid a vile nature underneath.

 

“Then I’ll adjust the schedule to match the hotel opening date. Since you’ll be in the capital, I’ll arrange for you to handle all matters requiring your attention at once.”

 

“Don’t report to the mansion yet.”

 

Despite his hatred for other Altaharts, Victor silently bowed.

 

After his secretary left, Ulrich worked for a while. After reviewing and clearing the piled-up documents, he found that night had fallen. He looked at the darkening sky, then stood up quietly.

 

“I heard she is in the drawing room.”

 

Is she still there?

 

He headed towards the drawing room. The sound of his footsteps echoed in the wide, silent hallway. The night breeze, passing through the occasionally open windows, felt pleasant.

 

“The driver said he looked like he was about to cry.”

 

Ulrich’s smile deepened. He brushed his hair back in the soft breeze. He felt a thrill from the idea that Lisbell and he had shared a thought at that moment.

 

He soon reached the drawing room and opened the door. It was quiet inside. After confirming no one was there, he was about to leave.

 

But something caught his eye.

 



 

Ulrich approached the sofa. A piece of black cloth stuck out. It was a necktie, thrown carelessly. He was the only one in this villa who owned something like that.

 

He quickly deduced its origin. It was likely the tie he had used to tie her hair when she went to meet her fiancé.

 

If it’s here…

 

“Ha.”

 

So, she wasn’t just being prideful.

 

Ulrich picked up the tie, which seemed about to fall off the sofa. A gray hair was tangled at the end, as if it had been forcefully pulled out.

 

He stared at the thin strand.

 

He remembered the taste of her tears he had once licked. He wondered if it would taste the same here, but he didn’t bring it to his lips. If he were to taste it, he’d prefer it fresh from her rather than this discarded state.

 

After staring at the hair for a while, he let it float away lightly and left the drawing room with the tie in hand.

 

He quickly guessed where she might be. Even in such an infuriating situation, she wouldn’t abandon her duty to stay by her mother’s side. Her actions were always predictable.

 

What amazed him was himself.

 

Despite hating boredom, he didn’t find this predictable process tedious.

 

He didn’t know if this change was good or bad, but it wasn’t unpleasant. Ulrich hummed softly as he crossed the corridor.

 

The sky had turned a clean, dark black.

 

Under the particularly dark night sky, Ulrich reached the bedroom he had visited earlier that morning.

 

Knock, knock.

 

Knowing no one would answer, he opened the door immediately. It was quiet inside. But he couldn’t conclude she wasn’t there. Lisbell always sat like a wax doll, barely noticeable.

 



 

So he believed he would see her sitting quietly.

 

…She’s not here?

 

The room was empty.

 

Only the cold, dying figure on the bed was there. It was so unexpected that Ulrich looked around, still holding the doorknob.

 

But no matter how much he looked, he couldn’t find her.

 

Strangely, an unseen tension suddenly gripped his mind.

 

Even realizing she wasn’t there, he stepped into the bedroom. It was close to a malfunction, his assumption shattering.

 

Ulrich approached the bed, moving his tongue slowly. Mrs. Osborne slept like the dead, with the same face as yesterday and the day before.

 

Ulrich, arms crossed, leaned and looked down at her static face.

 

Then his gaze shifted.

 

Wind blew in through a slightly open window. The dark air felt thick under the sky that would soon hold the Milky Way.

 

Ulrich straightened up slowly.

 

The wind, once refreshing, now felt stifling. This was because an unthinkable assumption had emerged.

 

Did she leave her mother behind?

 

With her overly kind nature?

 

Impossible.

 

Even as he thought that, Ulrich quickly left the bedroom.

 

Given the driver’s report of Theodore looking like he was about to cry, and Lisbell’s refusal to see him off, it was clear. Today, Lisbell must have broken off the engagement. All signs pointed to it. It must have been a seismic shift in her life.

 

What if, in such a state, she momentarily lost her mind and decided to abandon her mother to escape?

 

Even thinking it unlikely, Ulrich’s steps quickened as he headed to her bedroom.


Still walking gracefully, it was a posture that anyone who knew him well would notice the distinct difference in an instant. Ulrich arrived at Lisbell’s bedroom without taking a single breath.

 

This time, he skipped knocking and abruptly flung the door open.

 

The interior was dim, barely recognizable. The curtains, which might have been drawn since the previous night or earlier, had not been pulled back, making the room feel eerily cold and silent.

 

Ulrich’s eyebrows twitched slightly.

 

In the desolate atmosphere, there was a faint smell of alcohol.

 

Ulrich quietly walked toward the bed. The first thing he saw was her disheveled hand. Then, he saw her back as she lay on her knees on the floor, leaning against the bed, asleep. Next to her feet lay a bottle of whiskey.

 

It was the whiskey he recently enjoyed.

 

Now he understood why she had been absent from the spot she usually occupied daily to take care of him.

 

Ulrich nudged the empty bottle with the toe of his shoe and looked down. Her sleeping posture, sprawled out without moving, was quite a sight.

 

He lifted his head slightly.

 

Even though it was his first time in Lisbell’s bedroom today, it unmistakably felt like her space despite being under his ownership. Slightly cluttered items and signs of use were noticeable.

 

The live-in staff diligently cleaned and maintained the villa daily, including his bedroom. It was the same kind of work that Mrs. Osborne did before she collapsed.

 

But Ulrich had instructed them not to touch this room. He didn’t want anyone else’s gaze or hands intruding on Lisbell’s domain. More precisely, he wanted to be the only one to touch it. He wanted to enjoy her pure essence untouched by anyone else.

 

And this space was the very presence of the living Lisbell.

 

Ulrich didn’t find the seemingly messy interior particularly unpleasant and bent his knees to sit.

 

“…Ah, it’s wrinkled.”

 

Holding it in his hand all the way here had crumpled his tie.

 

As he looked at it, he firmly grabbed Lisbell’s hair as she slept, lying face down. He didn’t hold back, and as he pulled, she let out a small groan, “uh…”

 

Daring to loosen it without permission.

 

Ulrich stroked her fine hair that slipped through his fingers. He never thought a day would come when he’d be so concerned with someone’s hair. The thin strands seemed like they could tear at any moment, but surprisingly, they were tough. It reminded him of her persistence.

 

Nonetheless, Lisbell’s gray hair clung to his fingers without tearing, feeling like a very thin whip. The more he toyed with it, the stranger he felt. Touching it with one hand, he realized the sensation was enough to bring him to climax if he pulled out his cock from his pants with the other.

 

He hadn’t planned on it, but once he became conscious of it, blood rushed to his lower body, swelling it tightly. Just as he wondered if he should go through with it, Lisbell turned her head, murmuring, 

 

“Mmm…”

 

Her thin hair slid smoothly through his fingers.

 

Ulrich stared at his empty hand momentarily before slowly loosening his tie. He slipped it over Lisbell’s head and placed his arm under her bent knees.

 

When he lifted her onto the bed, she tilted her head back, her moist lips slightly parting. Ulrich brought his face close to hers. The strong scent of alcohol in her breath was evident. The whiskey bottle, nearly empty, provided proof of where it had all gone.

 

Kneeling on one knee on the bed, Ulrich tightened the tie he had placed around her neck. As the space gradually closed, it soon fit snugly around her neck.

 

“…Cough.”

 

The tie tightened like a cord around her neck, causing Lisbell to instinctively gasp for breath, curling her fingers. Ulrich watched her struggle indifferently before gradually releasing his grip.

 

As he pulled the tie knot in the opposite direction, a faint mark appeared on her neck. The vague discomfort he felt on his way here dissipated somewhat.

 

Switching his gaze between his still-swollen groin and Lisbell’s pale face, Ulrich straightened up.

 

He hesitated briefly, remembering that he didn’t particularly enjoy the feeling of holding a drunken woman and having sex as if he were the only one indulging in lewdness.

 

His hand, which had been brushing against the tie’s wide end, was about to retreat into the air.

 

“…”

 

Then, Lisbell trembled and opened her eyes, which had been closed all this time.

 

Her pale purple eyes, slightly clouded with tears, searched the void meaninglessly before slowly focusing on the man occupying part of her vision. Ulrich reached out to close her eyes, which were clearly drunk.

 

“…Theo?”

 

But unexpectedly, his arm was grabbed.

 

Lisbell, with a voice that sounded like she had cried a lot, called out.

 

“Theo, is that you?”

 

Her pronunciation was more slurred than usual. Ulrich easily allowed himself to be pulled closer by the hand gripping his arm.

 

To be precise, it was the first time Lisbell had held onto him like this, so he was slightly bewildered and let himself be pulled.

 

“Don’t go.”

 



 

“Don’t go, Theo…”

 

Clinging to his arm with desperate hope, Lisbell mumbled, rubbing her face against it. Witnessing this, Ulrich quickly concluded.

 

She’s drunk.

 

Indeed, having drunk such a strong liquor on an empty stomach, it was impossible to avoid getting thoroughly drunk.

 

Nevertheless, seeing Lisbell, who usually stayed calm and barely smiled in front of him, clinging like this was quite novel. So, Ulrich remained still, allowing her to pull him further until he was practically lying on top of her.

 



 

Ulrich’s eyes gleamed softly in the darkness.

 

Even her lips, which occasionally pressed against his, carried the remnants of the intoxication lingering in the room. As he remained motionless, Lisbell, seeming to take his stillness as a sign, lifted her head and pressed her lips more firmly against his.

 

“…”

 

The soft moan leaking between her slightly parted lips was different from what he usually heard from her, more sensual. He found it amusing and slightly smiled, causing Lisbell to think he had given her permission and to gently suck on his slightly parted lips.

 

Ulrich maintained his half-bent posture, supporting himself with one hand on the bed. His dark gray eyes, gleaming in the darkness, were unusually calm for a man engaged in a kiss.

 

Mistaking him for her fiancé, whom she had tearfully sent away earlier, Lisbell kissed him, believing it was Theodore.

 

“Did you always kiss like this?”

 

He criticized the lukewarm kiss, with her timidly sucking on the surface of his lips. Every time he thrust his tongue deep into her mouth, she trembled like a rabbit caught by the tail, and now he understood why. If this was how she kissed her fiancé, it made sense.

 

“Even a child would do better than this.”

 



 

“I wonder if you even had a proper first night.”

 

His low voice murmured ambiguously, making Lisbell, thinking he was interrupting her kiss, let out a soft “…?” with a drawn-out moan.

 

Ulrich gently pressed her slender chin with his fingers.

 

Even in a room where it was difficult to find a single ray of light, the soft movement of her lips was visible and felt smooth. Whenever he approached her, it always felt like she reluctantly complied, but if this was how she kissed her fiancé, it made sense.

 

Ulrich smirked but felt a strange chill in the back of his mind.

 

He released her chin and lowered his head again to kiss her. This time, Lisbell, though hesitant, gradually wrapped her arms around his neck.

 

The seductive behavior, like the scent of strong flowers in spring, made Ulrich feel uncomfortable below.

 

Despite the overpowering scent of intoxication from her, there was something tantalizing about it. It was as if she knew how to stir a man’s desires with her charm.

Chapter 51.

“Ung… umm…”

 

Ulrich sighed as he watched her still clumsily pressing her lips against his, unable to do anything but rub insistently.

 

Through the wide-open door, Lisbell’s moist tongue cautiously pushed in as if testing the waters. Enjoying the sensation of her tongue scraping against his teeth, Ulrich quietly lowered his arms and lifted her neat skirt that fell to her knees.

 

As he touched her prominent kneecap and trailed his hand up her slender thigh, Lisbell immediately responded.

 

Her skin twitched as if sparks were flying, but she did not resist much. She merely occasionally curled her tongue inside her mouth and exhaled hot breaths that seemed almost scorching.

 

Still tipsy, Ulrich felt as if he was drinking along with her and savored it sweetly.

 

“Theo, I’m sorry…”

 
 

“I’m sorry, so don’t go… Huh, yeah…?”

 

Just as he started to feel her pleasantly licking the inside of his cheek, Lisbell suddenly clung to his clothes and pleaded. It was obvious that her trembling eyes behind tightly shut eyelids resembled a trapped herbivore.

 

“Where am I going?”

 

“Don’t go… I, uh, I lied…”

 

“What lie?”

 

“I said I, uh… don’t love you anymore.”

 



 

“But actually, the truth is, I still…”

 

“Do you love me?”

 

“Do you love me?”

 

Lisbell slowly opened her eyes towards the deep darkness.

 

Her trembling hand clutched his coat, recognizing him only by his silhouette. Ulrich gazed down at her under the same circumstances.

 

The only difference was that her vision was blurred by drunkenness, whereas he was sober.

 

Ulrich wondered if she might sober up now. If she did, he was curious about how she would react.

 

Probably, her face would turn pale, and she would push him away in disgust, treating him like a germ, crawling away from him even if it meant crawling on all fours.

 

Watching her react like that, he thought it wouldn’t be bad to strip her skirt and immediately thrust into her. If he thrust deeply, spanking her buttocks while hitting her most sensitive spots, she would squirm and spill clear fluid like urine.

 

Her face and other features would turn as red as her heated hole from the thrusting, bringing out her most erotic side. This too seemed not a bad idea.

 

“I love you…”

 



 

“This too, this too is sincere…”

 

Her weak voice, which had been trailing off like a loose thread, was now quite clear.

 

Ulrich looked down at her innocent face, pouring out a heartfelt confession to the wrong person.

 

The kiss resumed urgently. This time, it was Ulrich who initiated it.

 

Lisbell, seemingly startled by his uncharacteristic boldness, soon sweetly accepted his intruding tongue like a piece of sugar.

 

Wet sounds leaked from the slightly parted and then rejoined lips. The mingling saliva loudly testified to how lustfully the two small pieces of flesh were rubbing against each other.

 

“Lift your hips.”

 

Ulrich, nibbling on her tongue, murmured as he pushed his arm towards her buttocks. Lisbell, exhaling roughly, cautiously complied with the command. While doing so, she carefully grasped his dark arm.

 

“Why, but, huh…?”

 



 

“Your way of speaking, uh, since a while ago…?”

 

Ulrich, who had been removing her lower garments with quiet efficiency, raised his eyebrows slightly.

 

“Way of speaking?”

 

“You don’t usually use formal speech… but you keep…”

 

It seemed she was caught on an irrelevant point. Even amidst this, her inability to sober up was indeed remarkable.

 

She had said before that she was quite weak to alcohol. The whiskey stocked in the villa was strong enough to make even heavy drinkers like him feel lightheaded, so it must have easily pushed her to the brink of unconsciousness.

 

As a result, even now, rubbing her lower abdomen obscenely, she accepted it without any resistance.

 

“Should I stop?”

 

Ulrich asked as he stroked her soft pubic hair hidden in her underwear.

 

Lisbell frowned slightly but soon returned to her dazed state.

 

“Yeah…”

 

“Why?”

 

“Because it keeps, keeps reminding me.”

 

“Reminding you of what?”

 

“Of someone I don’t like…”

 



 

“That man keeps…”

 

He couldn’t help but laugh in disbelief.

 

She had no idea that she was rubbing bodies with the very person she claimed to dislike, right before intercourse. If she knew, she wouldn’t be tangled up like this in the dim bedroom.

 

Suppressing a reflexive laugh, Ulrich whispered, “That’s too much.”

 

“…Yeah?”

 

“Then, if you don’t like it…”

 

Ulrich’s hand slowly withdrew from her lower body, where he had made room for entry. His elegantly outlined hand grabbed his own trousers. The act of unbuttoning in the dark was vivid enough to stir tension.

 

He licked his dry lips and left a brief kiss on the corner of Lisbell’s mouth.

 

“Then I’ll just thrust it in.”

 

His trousers were fully undone. With one gesture, he pulled out his stiff, engorged erect!on. The reddish, swollen head of his cock threatened as it bobbed against his firm abs.

 

As he grasped the blunt tip and rubbed it, pre-cum had already started to trickle down. From the moment she started her misguided declaration of love, he had been aching down there.

 

“Umm… ung.”

 

Suppressing the softly struggling Lisbell with his body, he pressed their lips together again. Every time he softly licked her alternating lips, her belly button trembled.

 

Ulrich spread her legs a bit more and removed her skirt and underwear, revealing her wet vulva. He pressed his cock against her smooth entrance and rubbed it.

 

“Haa…”

 

“uh… yeah… ah…”

 

Instead of immediately penetrating, he rubbed the soft entrance. As his veined surface stimulated her, Lisbell twisted her waist and moaned.

 

Ulrich grabbed her wriggling buttocks, deepening the intimate contact between their gen!talia. As he raised her arousal, her flesh softened, and she began to show moistness.

 

Meanwhile, his lips were not idle either. He persistently found and sucked her tongue that kept trying to hide, stealing her breath in an obscene manner.

 

Ulrich felt as if he was getting drunk himself.

 

The more he plunged his tongue into her mouth and stole her sticky breath and saliva, the more his rational mind was overlaid with hazy heat.

 

“Haa, haa.”

 

Moaning and writhing, Lisbell did not resist. She might truly believe tonight is her first night with her fiancé.

 

Ulrich chuckled darkly.

 

Knowing that he was about to take both her real and fake first night, he already pictured her reaction when she found out later.

 

Would she cry, get angry, feel desolate, or despair? The various possibilities were already a delightful plaything.

 

“Hoo…”

 

Even so, he sighed deeply.

 

The tantalizing play was reaching its limit.


After several sessions of !ntercourse, the opening widened without much resistance, despite the gentle pressure pushing in. It had only been pressed a few times between the tender flesh, but already his entire shaft was sticky with fluids.

 

Now it was time to thoroughly beat it with his arm, swollen to the size of a forearm.

 

“uh…!”

 

Startled, Lisbell grabbed the sheets tightly with both hands and squeezed her buttocks as Ulrich suddenly flipped her over.

 

Ulrich pulled her lower body closer, making it stick tightly. Then, he naturally took a position from behind, spreading her buttocks apart. He saw the wet hole below the tender flesh, sticking to his palm, glistening with moisture.

 

Before entering, he stretched it from side to side. Over time, the previously tight contraction had eased a bit, and the previously soft color had darkened slightly.

 

It was a satisfying change.

 

As he wondered if this would one day become stained like a mark he personally left, Ulrich thrust his wet center inside all at once.

 

“…Ah…!”

 

Despite being soaked, it was quite a struggle to push it all the way to the base.

 

Ulrich pushed deep into the tight inner walls with pure strength. The inner walls, forcibly opened, trembled with slight spasms.

 

Then, he adjusted to the rounded buttocks, thrusting rhythmically, causing the inside to tremble wildly.

 

“Ah, ah, ah…!”

 

Lisbell instinctively swayed her hips, rubbing her forehead against the sheet. It was uncharacteristic of her.

 

Perhaps she was mistaken in thinking that the one penetrating her was her fiancé, but being intoxicated itself was likely bringing unexpected exhilaration. Good sex even when sober can be enhanced with the addition of alcohol or drugs.

 

There was no need to make her turn her face this way to confirm. Not only her lewd appearance but the change in the inner flesh as it received him indicated that she was willing.

 

Today, after only a bit of initial resistance, the rhythmical piston movement was not difficult at all.

 

Her insides tightened perfectly, squeezing the flesh pleasingly with every thrust. Ulrich held her pale buttocks in both hands, fingers gripping tightly, and rapidly bounced his hips.

 

“Wait, just a moment…!”

 

The act was paused briefly.

 

Lisbell, gripping the sheet like a lifeline, reached back to hold Ulrich. Or rather, it was more of a pushing motion than a grasping one.

 

Ulrich stared blankly at the long, slender fingers resting on him. For a brief moment, he felt a violent impulse to break each finger that was hindering this rapid pleasure.

 

“I don’t like this, Theo…”

 

“You don’t like it?”

 

No way.

 

Ulrich, with a sneer, slammed his pen!s deep, making a loud noise, as if questioning how she could say she didn’t like it when she was greedily sucking it in. Lisbell flailed like a fish out of water.

 

“Ah! This position, I hate it! Please…!”

 

Ulrich’s powerful thrusts paused.

 

Even in this situation, Lisbell, unable to control her limbs due to the overwhelming pleasure, collapsed forward with a wet voice.

 

“It reminds me of him. I hate this position…”

 



 

“I don’t want to think of him while I’m with you…”

 



 

“So, please… please…”

 

In short, she was asking him to stop using the position that reminded her of intercourse with him, not to stop the sex altogether.

 

Ulrich, initially unresponsive, let out a quiet laugh.

 

With eyes that were hot yet cold, like ice within flames, he looked down at her thin back and flipped her over to a straight position, grabbing her knees.

 

Following her trembling body, the loosely tied necktie fluttered. He grabbed it, pulling her neck slightly towards him.

 

“Is this what you want?”

 

Without knowing who she was with, she was making demands like this.

 

Even as he thought this, Ulrich complied with Lisbell’s request. It was a small pleasure saved for later. For now, she only associated certain positions with him, but eventually, she would think of him regardless of the position, marking her deeply.

 

“Is this good?”

 

“Yes, uh, ah…!”

 

“Do you like it, facing me like this?”

 

Resuming the rhythmic thrusts in the new position, Lisbell’s face flushed deeper red, moving aimlessly.

 

So stupid.

 

Despite his mocking thoughts, Ulrich felt an uncontrollable heat rising.

 

He grabbed her behind the knees, lifting her lower body and thrusting upwards. The thin, wet pubic hair stuck annoyingly to both her crotch and his groin, adding to the irritating sensation.

 

“Do you like it? Huh?”

 

“Ah, ah…!”

 

“Answer, Lisbell.”

 

“Yes, I like it… Ah…!”

 

“Then say you love me again.”

 

“Uh, ah, ah…!”

 

“Say it again. Come on…”

 

Slowing his thrusts deliberately, he urged her. Lisbell clung to him more tightly, embracing him with her whole body.

 

Lightly kissing her nose and flushed cheeks, he prompted her again, and Lisbell, perhaps mistaking his tender manner for that of her fiancé, whimpered.

 

“I love you, Theo. I love you…”

 

Ulrich couldn’t suppress a laughter bubbling up from his core. He kissed her tongue, wrapping it around his own, then whispered softly in her ear.

 

“But I’m not Theo.”

 

“Uh…? Uh?”

 

“Do you still love me?”

 

Lisbell panted heavily. He increased his pace as soon as he threw out the unsettling question. Penetrating deeply into the wet hole, Lisbell clung to him, her body convulsing.

 

Even as she was overwhelmed by pleasure, her eyes darted upward, unable to ignore his strange words.

 

Ulrich covered her eyes with his hand and continued thrusting into the soft, concave spot inside. His heavy, tight scrotum was already pulling taut. Today’s sex was strangely enjoyable, and the urge to climax was approaching faster than usual.

 

“Theo… Theo…?”

 

“Yes, I’m here.”

 

“Theo… uh, ah…!”

 

“I’m here, Lisbell…”

 

Giggling, he teased her with exaggerated affection.

 

Toying with her deliberately, he focused all his energy on thrusting, as if to completely dominate her. Holding her slender waist, he pushed her up strongly.

 

Lisbell felt it acutely every time he grazed towards her navel. She particularly enjoyed it when he targeted that area from behind.

 

“Ah, Theo! Theo!”

 

“Is it good with Theo, huh? Does your fiancé’s dick feel that different?”

 

Under normal circumstances, she would have felt something was off, but unfortunately, Lisbell was too far gone to notice. With her mind muddled by potent intoxication and the burning heat inside her, she couldn’t harbor any doubts and clung to him.

 

Through the blurry, swaying vision, she saw only darkness.

 

Whatever form it took, in her sorrow-stricken eyes after losing her fiancé, it was perceived only as Theodore returning to her.


“Theo, Theo, ah, just a little more… uh, ah, ah!”

 

The rapid and forceful invasion at the entrance quickened. Lisbell became like a nail being hammered, her body trembling as she curled inward. Ulrich persistently pushed into her and whispered in her ear.

 

“Can I do it inside?”

 

“Uh, huff, huh…? Ah! Ah…!”

 

“Lisbell, inside you… ha….”

 

“Huff, ah….”

 

“We’re going to get married anyway, right?”

 

He asked in a tone so gentle and desperate that Lisbell, caught off guard, nodded while clinging to his neck.

 

Ulrich’s smile, caught at the corners of his lips, darkened like a shadow in a shaded corner.

 

“You gave me permission.”

 

Ulrich, who held her ankles apart and aligned below, thrust passionately. Lisbell, unable to even swallow her saliva, rubbed the back of her head against the sheet, crying out.

 

The squelching sound continued between their hips.

 

The inside, which had loosened up, clung to the shaft as if pleading not to let go, then barely returned to its place, repeating this pattern. Each time the intense coupling that felt like it would pull her insides out continued, wet traces spurted everywhere.

 

“Ah, ah, aaah…! Uh-huh!”

 

Lost in the sensuality squeezing her entire body, Lisbell reached the pinnacle that struck her brain sharply. The woman’s piercing moans, which had been quite sharp, gradually faded and then died away.

 

Meanwhile, Ulrich wrapped the tie around her neck in his hand and pulled.

 

Kissing her deeply, he accelerated to the final speed.

 

Pressing firmly against her thigh, already marked by light abrasions from the constant contact, he forcefully thrust his glans up to her cervix.

 

“Hmm…!”

 

As the act subsided, Lisbell, unable to swallow her saliva, wandered the air with unfocused pupils, reaching another climax. Ulrich, watching her messy appearance, ejaculated.

 

As she had wished, his body shook with satisfaction, and Lisbell’s convulsions, nearly at the level of shivering, subsided. Her arms and legs also lost all strength.

 

Now, completely limp, she breathed softly, as if finally falling into a sleep she could not escape.

 

Her gray hair, disheveled, covered the side of her face. Watching this, Ulrich leaned forward. He finally took a mouthful of her fluttering hair, sucking it gently like he had with her lips earlier, then slowly let it go.

 

“Hmm.”

 

It wasn’t particularly tasty. The texture was what he enjoyed. Earlier, it had clung to his fingers, and now it clung to his tongue, the unfamiliar sensation feeling fresh. It seemed he could chew it playfully whenever he was bored.

 

But Ulrich thought of something else.

 

Letting go of the hair, his lips naturally moved to bite Lisbell’s lips.

 

Already asleep, her lips parted easily with the slightest touch. The willingness and innocence, still recognizing him as her fiancé, were both gratifying and annoying.

 

Suppressing a chuckle, he filled her mouth with his tongue. Biting her swollen lips until they puffed up, he slowly withdrew. Grabbing her limp legs, he hoisted them over his shoulder, realigning their connection.

 

The smell of alcohol lingering in the air was almost gone. Ulrich’s nerves, now fully alert, could only detect Lisbell’s body scent. Perhaps it was because of the hair he had just chewed.

 

Accepting it gladly, he adjusted his posture. He then carefully undressed her one by one.

 

He didn’t bother to remove the tie around her naked body.

 

Whenever he felt unsatisfied, he would pull and loosen the tie in his hand.

 

Even in her sleep, Lisbell occasionally coughed lightly, feeling the physical pressure. Each time, he would smile sweetly and quicken his pace a little more.

 



 

She had developed a habit of waking up, counting the hours of the night, not knowing when she had fallen asleep. It was always like this in the morning.

 

Lisbell, lying on her side, quietly rolled her half-open eyes.

 

When did I come back to this room?

 

As she wandered through these thoughts, fragmented memories floated to the surface. And when those memories finally turned into the image of Theodore crying with his head on her lap, Lisbell held her breath.

 



 

That’s right.

 

Yesterday, Lisbell had notified her fiancé of their breakup. It was truly a unilateral and disgraceful manner. After that, she had guarded her mother’s sickbed, unable to bear it any longer, and intended to return to her room. During this process, through the crack of an accidentally opened door….

 

Ah, alcohol.

 

She remembered coming back to this bedroom and drinking directly from the bottle without a glass. No wonder her head had been splitting with pain.

 

What’s this… a tie?

 

She noticed several things in succession. A tie draped over her completely naked body, and a man’s arm resting across her waist.

 

She became aware of the soft breathing against her back.

 

When did this man arrive?

 

There was no memory of Ulrich in the last scene she remembered. She had been drinking alone in this bed. Though she didn’t know what had happened, her entire body felt achy as if she had been tossed around.

 

Lisbell let out a small groan and twisted her body, only to freeze. Goosebumps ran up her stiffened back.

 

It’s still… inside.

 

As soon as she moved her lower body slightly, it felt sticky between her buttocks. Once conscious of it, the foreign sensation became overwhelmingly uncomfortable. The reason for the unusually tight position was clear. Ulrich’s penis was still inside her.

 

Revulsion and fear simultaneously washed over her. The thought that she might have been like this all night made her feel sick, and the physical strain of being spread out for so long scared her.

 

Lisbell bit her lip hard enough to draw blood and cautiously lifted her upper body. She slowly moved forward.

 

“Huff….”

 

Despite her efforts to stay silent, a faint moan escaped. The heavy flesh slid out slowly, laden with the foam that had built up overnight. The empty space inside her throbbed and ached from the prolonged friction. Dampness oozed out. Startled, Lisbell quickly wiped between her legs with her palm.

 



 

Her hand was smeared with a sticky liquid, resembling a mix of milk and oil. Lisbell stared down at the evidence, bewildered.

 

“.”

 

Just then, the man beside her stirred, unknowingly draping his arm over his forehead. Ulrich, yawning and still half-asleep, opened his pale eyelashes.

 

He reached out to Lisbell, who was sitting there staring at her hand in disbelief, and lightly touched the long tie hanging diagonally down her body. She jolted awake and turned her head.

 

“Why… are you here?”

 

“Don’t you remember?”

 



 

“Of course not. You drank an entire bottle.”

 

He added that it was stronger than she had thought, then slowly sat up.

 

His eyes, usually docile, looked even more droopy with lingering sleepiness. He yawned again and ruffled his messy platinum hair. Lisbell, staring blankly at his face, spoke.

 

“Clearly….”

 

“Hmm?”

 

“Clearly, we agreed not to….”

 

Mentioning the contract clause prohibiting internal ejaculation, Ulrich, realizing the source of the traces, let out a lazy laugh.

 

Propping himself up with a cushion, he started to look for a cigarette, then remembered this was her bedroom and stopped.

 

“You gave me permission, Lisbell. You said I could do it inside.”

 



 

“Ah, you probably don’t remember that either.”

 

He removed the blanket covering his lower body and got out of bed. Stretching leisurely, he ignored the crumpled shirt and put on his pants. As he buckled up, he noticed her still staring at her palm helplessly and chuckled.

 

“And it doesn’t matter anymore, does it?”

 



 

“I saw yesterday that you’re completely done with Mr. Motier.”


Those words struck a nerve with Lisbell, who had been struggling to regain her composure. She lowered her hand, which she had been keeping suspended awkwardly, and wiped it on the blanket. Though the marks disappeared quickly, she still felt uneasy, as if something muddy was clinging to her.

 

Moreover, the inexplicable tie around her neck was another source of discomfort. It was definitely “his” tie. Lisbell was about to impatiently remove it when he spoke.

 

“Were you the one who wanted to break off the engagement first?”

 



 

“Or did you suggest it?”

 

“It’s unrelated to this.”

 



 

“I hope this kind of thing doesn’t happen again.”

 

“Why?”

 



 

“Afraid you might get pregnant?”

 

Lisbell refrained from answering and stood up. With a lingering hangover and the recent breakup with Theodore still fresh, she had no energy to deal with the man in front of her. She just wanted to rush into the bathroom and wash off her tainted body.

 

As Ulrich approached the curtained window, he spoke to her retreating back.

 

“Wash up and come down to the dining room. Let’s eat together.”

 

“…I’m not in the mood.”

 

“Come down anyway.”

 

“I said I’m not in the mood.”

 

“Do I seem like I’m making a suggestion?”

 

Lisbell bit her lip hard.

 

Walking along the window, he methodically drew back the curtains. The room, which had been dark the previous night, was now flooded with light. Despite the bright scene, Lisbell seemed about to collapse, while the man stood comfortably, basking in the morning sunlight, and spoke cheerfully.

 

“I have something to tell you.”

 

“Then tell me here….”

 

“While we eat. Lisbell, you’ll feel worse if you stay on an empty stomach after drinking so much last night. You need to eat something.”

 

She knew well enough that his occasional kindness was just a facade. Lisbell no longer fell for it.

 



 

“If you really don’t want to… I’ll just have to visit that bedroom where your mother is lying down. You’re always there, after all.”

 

Lisbell’s face hardened with rejection. Smiling flawlessly, Ulrich picked up the tie from the bed. Only after clutching it did he leave the room as if his business was finished.

 

Lisbell immediately headed to the bathroom and turned on the faucet. The water cascaded over her body, washing every corner.

 

But she didn’t feel cleansed. Instead, she felt more suffocated. Standing under the hot water until her skin was thoroughly warmed, she finally stepped out after a long while.

 

After washing, she checked the clock on the table.

 

Her headache persisted, and her stomach felt uneasy. She wanted nothing more than to collapse onto the bed and sleep. But she couldn’t do that without knowing what he meant by having something to say.

 

If it concerned her mother, avoiding it was pointless. Besides, he said he’d come to her mother’s bedroom if she didn’t go….

 

Suppressing a groan, Lisbell rummaged through the closet.

 

Half of it was filled with thin slips Ulrich had his secretary stock without her consent. Pushing them aside disdainfully, she selected a clean outfit. It was just her usual neat blouse and a long flare skirt that covered her legs.

 

She considered tying her damp hair, but feeling too lazy, she left the bedroom.

 

As she entered the dining room, the rich aroma of warm soup filled the air. Ulrich approached and set a pre-served bowl of soup before her as she sat down.

 

He too seemed to have washed, with his hair slightly damp, and wore a light gown suitable for indoors. Lisbell glanced at the steaming soup, then watched him pick up his fork.

 

“What is it you need to say?”

 

“Just eat first.”

 

“Tell me, and I’ll eat.”

 

“Do I need to feed you directly?”

 



 

“Are you a baby?”

 

Annoyed by his words, Lisbell picked up the spoon. She didn’t want to give in, but his taunts were grating. If she kept resisting, he might really grab her and force the hot soup into her mouth.

 

The mere thought exhausted her, so she reluctantly took a spoonful of the soup. It was fortunately palatable. She’d noted before how surprisingly good the food was, considering it was for someone like him.

 

“I need to visit the capital in a few days.”

 

He finally got to the point as she started eating. Lisbell’s hand paused. She looked up quickly. Ulrich met her unexpected gaze as he lit a cigarette.

 

“I have an unmissable appointment.”

 



 

“Your mother’s treatment will continue as usual. Nothing will change except my absence. But I thought you should know.”

 

“When will you be back?”

 

“Why are you curious?”

 



 

“Planning to run away?”

 

Lisbell’s grip on the spoon tightened. Her gaze dropped.

 

“How could I run away?”

 



 

“Mother hasn’t regained consciousness.”

 

“If you really wanted to, you could.”

 



 

“Though, I suppose there’s no need to try so hard now. You’re completely done with Mr. Motier.”

 

The soup that had been manageable moments ago now felt nauseating. Every time Ulrich intentionally brought up Theodore, it made her feel sick. It was like her Achilles’ heel was being cruelly exposed.

 

“Is that all you needed to say?”

 

She put down the spoon with a clatter and stood up, only to be yanked back into the chair by her arm. The grip was so strong it hurt, and Lisbell frowned in pain.

 

“Do you really not remember anything from last night?”

 

“…uh.”

 

“You melted my heart completely.”

 

Seeing Lisbell’s pained face, he slowly released her arm and gently rubbed the spot. As he exhaled cigarette smoke, he murmured.

 

“Did you know you told me you loved me last night?”

 

Lisbell’s eyes widened in disbelief.

 

“You said it several times.”

 



 

“Several times….”

 

His lazy voice spread through the smoke, as if savoring the memory.

 

Lisbell realized his malicious intent to force her to recall a night she didn’t want to remember, which she couldn’t recall anyway.

 

“…Didn’t you learn that taking advantage of a drunk person is unworthy of a gentleman?”

 

Ulrich’s eyes slowly returned to her. His gaze, intense and fiery, couldn’t be ignored. Lisbell instinctively drew her knees together.

 

“You grabbed me first.”

 



 

“You clung to me, crying and begging me not to leave.”

 



 

“Ah, didn’t I mention? I’m weak against your crying face.”

 

Both possibilities existed.

 

He could be lying to mess with her, or she could have really clung to him in her drunken state. If only her memory were clear, she would know instantly, but the events of last night were a blank. The more she tried to recall, the worse her headache got. It was a severe hangover.

 

“Even if I did… You should have ignored it as drunken behavior.”

 

“You kissed me first, you know. Don’t you remember?”

 

“You should have just left me alone and walked out.”

 

“You kissed me several times. You even used your tongue first.”

 



 

“Hugging my neck… begging me not to leave while wrapping your legs around my waist.”

 

She couldn’t listen any longer.

 

“I didn’t think it was you!” Lisbell gasped, her eyes filled with resentment.


Even if what he said was true, nothing would change.

 

It was probably because she was drunk and mistook him for Theodore that she acted so disgracefully.

 

Last night, the man who pretended to be her fiancé in the cover of pitch-black darkness was none other than Ulrich Altahart. Now, just the thought of him made her feel repulsed, someone she could never have good feelings for. No matter what, that wouldn’t change.

 

“If it were you.”

 



 

“If I knew it was you, I never would have….”

 

She wouldn’t have done it.

 

The words choked with sobs were swallowed down and never came out.

 

It was truly a cursed night.

 

No matter how hard she tried to ignore it, her constant recollections of last night kept making her think of Theodore.

 

After telling him the lie that she no longer loved him and announcing the breakup, she couldn’t console him as he cried on her lap, cowardly standing by as he wept. She just sat there, watching as he completely left, feeling like she was hanging herself in this prison-like villa.

 

It was a sort of torture, constantly being reminded that the future she had tried so hard to protect was shattered to pieces.

 

Lisbell wiped away the tears running down her cheeks. From the other side, she heard the sound of someone clicking their tongue.

 

“Change your mind a little.”

 



 

“Now that you no longer have a fiancé to feel guilty about, you don’t need to be so distressed. Last night, Lisbell, you felt good enough holding onto me. Honestly, it felt good, didn’t it? You cried and climaxed so many times with me….”

 



 

“If your fiancé is gone, shouldn’t you be able to enjoy yourself a bit more?”

 

Lisbell felt dizzy.

 

His words were really hard to understand. Did he think that the reason she found this relationship difficult was simply because of guilt towards her fiancé?

 

Close, but not entirely correct.

 

Ulrich viewed relationships between people too simplistically and superficially. He didn’t consider the inner depths, only the external factors, defining cause and effect based on that alone.

 

Lisbell realized this after a moment.

 

“You…”

 

Her voice was dry and sounded like metal.

 

She looked out the window. The sky, which had been clear for several days, seemed a bit dimmer. The green leaves on the branches were slightly discolored at the edges.

 

Late summer was ending.

 

It was a sign that cool autumn was coming.

 

“You’ve never loved anyone, have you?”

 



 

“That’s why you can say things like that….”

 

There was a time when she hoped that everything might end after summer passed. Standing in front of the autumn that had finally arrived, she realized how futile that hope was.

 

Her mother was still the same, and the future she dreamed of with Theodore had completely crumbled.

 

So, what was she doing here now?

 

“Love?”

 

Ulrich stood up.

 

He grabbed Lisbell’s arm, who was staring off into the distance. Her slender body was forcibly pulled up and pushed onto the dining table. Ulrich pushed away the soup bowl that was barely touched. The sound of the chair falling and the bowl shattering on the floor mixed together messily. Her hearing seemed to fail her as everything crumbled.

 

“Why bother with something so childish and tiring?”

 

Ulrich flipped her flare skirt up. Feeling her underwear being pulled down to her ankles in an instant, Lisbell bit her lip. Her buttocks, bruised from his grasp last night, were spread apart.

 

“Like this.”

 

He undid the cord roughly tied around his waist and pulled out his erect!on, rubbing it against Lisbell’s dry vulva.

 

The foreplay was short. As if to vent his displeasure, he thrust into her dry vag!na.

 

“…Ah…!”

 

“There’s a hole you can spread whenever you want… ha, anyway.”

 

A deep breath escaped his lips. Lisbell tightened her lower abdomen. Despite feeling a distinctly different pressure from last night, Ulrich persistently moved his hips.

 

“Ah, ah, uh…. “

 

From the woman underneath him came dry moans, different from the sweet ones of the night before.

 

Even so, once a body was accustomed to pleasure, it couldn’t easily forget that overwhelming sensation. As he scraped inside her with his engorged shaft, her inner walls reluctantly released moisture reflexively.

 

Ulrich continued his increasingly slick thrusts, raising his eyes.

 

Her hair, not tied up, covered her face again. He brushed it away, tucking it behind her ear. Her delicate profile was revealed. Ulrich stared intensely at her vacant, purple eyes and thrusted deeply, smiling lazily.

 

“Ah, as I thought.”

 

“uh, ah…”

 

“You’re the prettiest when you cry and moan absentmindedly.”

 

Lisbell gripped the tablecloth tightly.

 

His words, meant to shatter her pride, made her feel resigned rather than angry. Reality still coldly surrounded her. No matter what feelings she had towards this man, she couldn’t escape this situation.

 

Even if one side’s love was broken, as long as the other side’s love remained….

 

Unless she found a perfect way to take her mother out of his grasp, there was no other choice.

 

With every passionate thrust from behind, her vision shook. It felt like she was being plunged to the bottom of the sea. Perhaps it was the pressure on her chest making it hard to breathe.

 

Lisbell, staring weakly to the side, slowly closed her eyes.

 

What am I….

 

So, what am I doing now….

 



 

The boulevard decorating the Laurent Square in the capital was already painted with the reds and yellows of autumn.

 

The ballroom of the Alstard Hotel, adorned with fragrant osmanthus and autumn roses, exuded meticulous opulence befitting an event hosted by the Altahart family. On closer inspection, it was dazzlingly luxurious, but the overall picture blended together naturally. Their display of luxury was so elaborate.

 

Many eyes were on the man standing in the center of the ballroom like a painting.

 

When he gave a smooth speech from the podium, there was at least a pretext to openly watch, but now, glances quickly turned away, fearful of being caught. The excitement in their eyes was clear, a pure curiosity towards the exceedingly handsome man.

 

“Well, who do we have here!”

 

Someone approached the man with a champagne glass. In a party like this, the military uniform naturally drew attention.

 

“Our little treasure of Altahart!”

 

Ulrich managed a slight smile, thinking how unbecoming the nickname was for someone of his age.

 

“Colonel Craxson, you made it.”

 

“Haha. These days, seeing your face is as hard as plucking a star from the sky. Only at events like these do I get to see this expensive face.”

 

The world was changing rapidly. At the end, even the once seemingly eternal authority of the nobility was fading like a setting sun.

 

Titles of nobility were no longer prestigious accomplishments. More and more areas were emphasizing visible financial power over such intangible authority.

 

Amidst the increasingly sharp conflict between the monarchy and parliament surrounding the state, the Altahart family maintained close ties with military units capable of mobilizing force, acting as a centrist power.

 

Strength, as unchanging in value as money.

 

Of course, it wasn’t just for political advantage. The more eyes on them, the more restricted their actions. For personal matters requiring manpower, it was much less conspicuous to use the Colonel’s name than that of Altahart. It was a friendship maintained for such purposes.

 

“I’ve been busy with various matters. Just last month, I sent a gift to you through my secretary. I hope you received it safely.”

 

“Oh, of course. I got it, and it was a big hit with my unit.”

 

“It was just a small gift.”

 

“Small gift? Come on, you should know when to be modest.”

 

Colonel Craxson’s eyes, slightly bloodshot from burst capillaries, were a common side effect among drug users. Standing before a soon-to-be addict, Ulrich smiled leisurely.

 

Having tried various substances himself, Ulrich had lost interest as he wasn’t fond of the hazy state induced by drugs. Still, many covertly brought him illicit substances as tribute.

 

He saw great returns from re-gifting these as bribes. What he gave to Colonel Craxson was an aphrodisiac that doubled its effect when taken with alcohol. The Colonel’s vacant eyes indicated he had spent the night indulging in drugs, alcohol, and women.



“By the way, it seems your proud brother is absent today.”

 

Ulrich was still smiling, but his smile had slightly faded.

 

“Oh, you were looking for Gwen, I see. Unfortunately, he has a separate engagement today.”

 

“Is that so? It’s been hard to see Gwen these days. In the past, we would at least bump into each other at the White Club, but even that’s rare now. With both brothers so busy, your family must be thriving. Isn’t that right?”

 

Colonel Craxson laughed heartily and patted Ulrich’s shoulder. Ulrich responded with a pleasant smile. Shortly afterward, hearing someone calling from the other side, Colonel Craxson bid farewell and walked away.

 

“Did you have a good conversation?”

 

Victor, who had been anxious since the Colonel’s arrival, quickly approached and asked.

 

“Listening to a drug addict’s ramblings is pointless.”

 

“Someone might hear you.”

 

“All he does is shoot blindly, he must be out of his mind. Otherwise, he wouldn’t say such nonsense about being proud of Gwen.”

 

No wonder he was so edgy; just as feared, Colonel Craxson had brought up Gwen.

 

“…You held yourself well.”

 

“The guests?”

 

“All those who received invitations have confirmed their attendance.”

 

“Is there anyone left I need to greet personally?”

 

“There is one person… Ah, here she comes.”

 

Ulrich turned towards where Victor was pointing.

 

A woman with elegant brown hair, half pinned with jeweled accessories, wearing an emerald chiffon dress, approached with the sound of clicking heels. Realizing the two knew each other, Victor quietly stepped back.

 

“Ulrich.”

 

Her voice was as graceful as a wild rose.

 

Ulrich lifted the gloved hand of the woman and kissed it. Among the ladies watching, exclamations of “Oh my!” were heard. The beauty of the approaching woman was extraordinary, and the two of them together looked like a piece of art.

 

As he lowered the hand he had been holding, Ulrich began to speak.

 

“I’m pleased you accepted the invitation, Lady Schwaben. Or should I call you Director Schwaben now?”

 

“You can still call me Daphne, as before.”

 

“I can’t do that. You’ve become the owner of the most famous art gallery in Laurent.”

 

“Are you drawing a line?”

 



 

“Don’t do that. I’ve called you Ulrich for a long time.”

 

Her eyes, asking prettily, were as moist as a deer’s. Ulrich looked down at her face, standing straight. Then Daphne took a step closer, clicking her heels.

 

“Is it because there are eyes watching us? Shall we go to a quiet place where no one is around?”

 

Ulrich’s eyebrows twitched slightly. Daphne’s clear and transparent eyes reflected that distinctly. A subtle tension, imperceptible to others, surrounded the two. Soon, Ulrich smiled meaningfully, as if to crush that atmosphere.

 

“A quiet place.”

 



 

“Why does it sound to me like you’re suggesting we do something naughty rather than have a conversation away from prying eyes?”

 

It was an unusually direct statement for the occasion. More surprising was Daphne’s reaction, blushing deeply as if shy. She was an unusual woman, now and then. He couldn’t deny that her unconventionality had once intrigued him.

 

He dismissed the fleeting past with a chuckle.

 

“Well, maybe in the past, but now it doesn’t seem appropriate.”

 

“What do you mean?”

 

“I mean our relationship.”

 

Ulrich leaned toward her slowly.

 

“You’re soon to be my brother’s wife.”

 



 

“Making a sister-in-law a secret mistress is a bit…”

 

Disgusting, isn’t it?

 

His voice was irresistibly seductive, meant only for her ears. As if to emphasize his point, Ulrich’s lips curved beautifully. It was the truth for him, but it was an offensive remark for her, touching on both her promiscuous past and her current respectable life.

 

Unexpectedly, Daphne let out a small laugh.

 

Ulrich maintained a smile, though his eyes showed a slight frown. His feelings mirrored this expression; he was put off by the unclear meaning of her laugh.

 

“It seems… the rumors about you being away from the capital for a while were true.”

 

“What do you mean?”

 

“If not, you would know better than I do.”

 

“I think you’ve had too much to drink.”

 

He smoothly wrapped a retort in polite language, and Daphne laughed, seemingly on purpose. Her inscrutable laughter subtly annoyed him.

 

“Today, I just came to greet you out of joy.”

 



 

“We’ll meet again soon, so let’s talk in detail then, Ulrich.”

 

“Yes, if you have any business, please make an appointment through my secretary.”

 

Even this clear statement that there would be no personal meetings didn’t dampen Daphne’s gentle smile as she left. Ulrich watched her departing figure, then signaled Victor, who was waiting nearby.

 

“I didn’t put that woman on the invitation list. Why is she here?”

 

“Well, actually… Madam Altahart reviewed the list later and added her.”

 

“My mother?”

 

“Yes.”

 

Hmm, Ulrich let out a significant hum.

 

“I can’t figure out the signal. Is it to make sure things are sorted out before my brother’s marriage?”

 

Daphne Schwaben.

 

Currently engaged to Gwen Altahart due to family alliances, she had once shared a bed with Ulrich. It wasn’t a relationship with heartfelt emotions but more of a mutually agreeable physical connection.

 

“If that’s the case, they’re sorely mistaken. It’s been sorted out long ago.”

 

That was the truth. Their time together was in the past. Enough time had passed for Daphne to be regarded as nothing more than a faded memory to Ulrich.

 

She had never held much significance to him anyway, but now, there was absolutely nothing left of their past connection.

 

Daphne had been one of the few who stayed by Ulrich’s side for quite some time among his past lovers. As someone who met him privately, she never overstepped her bounds publicly. She had a passable appearance and could nonchalantly handle his occasional harsh words.

 

Not because she was mature and broad-minded, but because her mind was inherently innocent, he concluded. It became evident while observing her.

 

Such traits didn’t often become a problem but occasionally amused Ulrich. Of course, he soon grew tired and unilaterally cut ties.

 

Afterward, she reappeared a year later as his brother’s fiancée.

 

“Can I leave now? They seem to be having a good time without me.”

 

Having attended the first part, including the owner’s speech, and staying through the second and third parts, considered the after-party, he had fulfilled his duties.

 

Victor nodded, and Ulrich set down the decorative glass he had been holding and sighed. Flashing a mesmerizing smile at anyone who met his eyes, he left the hall naturally.

 

Outside the banquet hall, he loosened the tight tie around his neck. The brooch pinned near the knot was bothersome.

 

He always had to dress meticulously for official events, down to the smallest detail, which was annoying. He never liked ties, but the one Lisbell gave him was nice because it lacked such cumbersome accessories.

 

It was smooth from the knot to the broad end, with nothing catching on his fingers, which he found refreshing. He developed a new habit of repeatedly smoothing it down when deep in thought, often wearing it at the Marnia villa.

 

Also, he found it amusing to see Lisbell shiver quietly whenever she saw it.


“Is that all?”

 

Despite knowing she could never escape, she still approached everything with intensity and desperation, which Ulrich found appealing.

 

To be honest, Ulrich had assumed that on the day Lisbell signed the contract with him, she would break off her engagement.

 

But she didn’t.

 

Until the day her fiancé visited the Marnia estate, Lisbell continued her hopeless relationship. That was her hope, as Ulrich saw in her beautiful face stained with drunken tears.

 

Even though it seemed she had given up, there was a subtle yet persistent desperation that kept her alive. How could that not pique his interest?

 

That’s why she crossed his mind even more in the capital.

 

People born into wealth, like him, who had never experienced true hardship, didn’t understand such intensity and desperation. For them, boasting and showing off was the sole purpose and pleasure in life.

 

Oddly enough, it was hard to feel any elegance from them. They seemed more vulgar and shameless. He was no exception; the entire Altahart family was like that. Their refined exteriors were just a facade, hiding dens of beasts filled with sordid desires.

 

Elegance.

 

Ironically, Ulrich felt it more in Lisbell, who tried her best in life. How could her earnest desire to live to the fullest not be considered noble?

 

Maybe he felt this way because he lacked it himself. She lived her life more meaningfully than he did, who found life so tedious that he wished to die soon.

 

In another sense, he wanted to delve deeper into her.

 

Why did she strive so hard to endure?

 

Everything ends in death anyway.

 

She would become like dust in the wind, ceasing to exist in this world….

 

Life is fleeting, yet Lisbell seemed to hold onto something that made her refuse to give up. This instinctive curiosity welled up within him, making him reflect on the roots of his own life.

 

He wondered what she would do if he severed all those lights she clung to and if he would feel any different from his current pessimistic self if he, too, found such light.

 

In any case, Lisbell was undoubtedly the greatest stimulant in his life right now.

 

He had planned to return to Marnia as soon as his schedule allowed, but the thought of the delicate scent that clung to him made him want to leave immediately. He wished the ground beneath his feet would change from the paved roads of the capital to Marnia’s lush lawns, not the marble reflecting the chandeliers of a luxury hotel.

 

Walking quickly but still composed, he headed for the quiet rear entrance of the hotel.

 



 

He was straightening his loosened tie when he noticed a sedan parked at the wide staircase below. The familiar face of the man standing courteously before the back seat caught his eye. Upon making eye contact, the man bowed respectfully.

 

“Madam Altahart sent me.”

 

It was his mother’s personal secretary.

 

“Oh dear.”

 

Ulrich muttered. It was a sigh of someone facing the inevitable.

 

He had hoped to leave quietly, but that seemed impossible.

 

Indeed, it was a bit surprising.

 

He hadn’t expected that his mother, let alone his brother Gwen, would attend an event that had already been communicated through Victor. It seemed they had retreated for a quiet meeting later.

 

Ignoring it would be an option, but if a summons from the family followed, it would complicate things. With a sigh, Ulrich obediently got into the back seat the secretary had opened for him.

 

The car glided smoothly along the central road.

 

The scenery of the capital hadn’t changed much. The glittering points of light that could hurt the eyes were still the same. Propping his chin, Ulrich surveyed the landscape before succumbing to fatigue and closing his eyes.

 

Soon, the sedan turned into a townhouse complex.

 

Passing by rows of grand houses, the car entered a massive estate even among the exclusive area.

 

Like an enlarged garden in Marnia, the expansive garden encircled a central fountain. The sedan came to a halt before a mansion boasting classic architectural style and vast grounds.

 

“We’ve arrived.”

 

With the driver’s announcement, the door opened.

 

Stepping out, Ulrich straightened his back, noting the staff lined up on either side, bowing deeply.

 

Despite so many visible heads, it was eerily silent, always a curious phenomenon. As Ulrich leisurely surveyed those waiting in hushed anticipation, he noticed the elderly butler approaching.

 

With a seemingly longer mustache, the butler greeted him courteously.

 

“Young Master, it’s been a while. Have you been well?”

 

“Considering I feel nauseous the moment I step in here, I suppose so.”

 

“That’s fortunate to hear. Madam is waiting for you. Please come in.”

 

Ignoring Ulrich’s sarcastic remark, the butler led the way. Unexpectedly interrupted on his way home, Ulrich checked his pocket watch. Leaving the reception early had given him some extra time.

 

Yet, in this house, you never knew when or where variables would arise. The topic his mother summoned him for would determine the extent of those variables.

 

“Oh my.”

 

As Ulrich entered the living room, a fond sigh greeted him.

 

He looked up to see his mother sitting regally on a single-seat sofa. A red-haired handsome man stood behind her. He was new.

 

“So, my hard-to-see son has finally arrived.”

 

“Glad to confirm I’m alive.”

 

Responding indifferently, Ulrich took a seat on the prepared sofa.

 

As he crossed his legs, a servant approached and listed the available beverages. Ulrich asked for a glass of iced soda. He was in a hurry, so he declined hot tea or coffee.

 

“Really, it’s heartbreaking…. How could you leave without a word? If Victor hadn’t been passing messages, I wouldn’t have known what to do.”

 

Acting as if deeply wounded by her son’s indifferent attitude, Lady Altahart clutched her chest. Ulrich chuckled at the sight.

 

“Your acting has improved.”

 

He leisurely added after quenching his thirst with the quickly served soda.

 

“What play inspired you this time?”

 

Both Ulrich and his brother Gwen knew well—his mother was the most eccentric person in this household.

 

She had a knack for changing faces, not in the surgical sense but in personality, as if another soul temporarily possessed her.

 

She had always loved theater, finding immense joy in observing others’ lives. “Tragedy up close, comedy from afar,” was a phrase she lived by.

 

Her husband’s death had let her whims bloom fully.



The beginning of it all was when the most popular male actor of the theater troupe came to the Altahart estate. At the time, I thought it was just because his charming appearance had caught her eye and she wanted to have some fun for a night.

 

But that wasn’t all.

 

The lady would take them as her lovers and then act as if she were the heroine of the play they starred in. She would fit herself into the role of their partner, living life as if she were that character. It was the essence of vicarious experience.

 

Those related to her realized this when the first male actor was quietly dismissed from his position as her lover, and a second actor was chosen to replace him.

 

When she was with them, her personality subtly changed. Since the heroines in the plays these actors starred in were different, she changed her face accordingly.

 

It was a bizarre act, but with enough money, nothing was impossible. And the lady had more than enough money to keep her secret dream alive.

 

Actors who caught her eye and served her received enormous sponsorship on a monthly basis. Furthermore, just the name Altahart was a powerful enough backing to ensure they wouldn’t be easily dismissed from leading roles. Their treatment within the troupe improved to almost that of the troupe leader.

 

Also, the lady had been a celebrated beauty in society. For a stunning woman like her, just a bit of flattery would make the money flow. It was a position many would volunteer for without hesitation.

 

To Ulrich, it seemed that his mother was currently absorbed in her own performance. The exaggerated act of dabbing at nonexistent tears with her long sleeves was an indication of that.

 

The “current” lover, standing by her side, comforted her, his touch subtly suggestive, befitting his role as a physical consort.

 

“So, what do you want from me?”

 

“Have you eaten?”

 

“Yes.”

 

“That’s a pity. I thought we could have a nice meal together after a long time.”

 

“Do that with my brother.”

 

“That’s difficult, which is why I’m asking you.”

 

Ulrich paused his idle sipping of sparkling water.

 

“What do you mean, difficult?”

 

“Gwen has collapsed.”

 

This was unexpected news.

 

Ulrich set down the glass he had been twirling.

 

“Suddenly?”

 

“Yes, it was a sudden blow.”

 

“Is there a problem?”

 

The lady sighed.

 

Her expression darkened slightly, revealing glimpses of her unmasked face.

 

“Syphilis, they say.”

 

“Syphilis?”

 

Ulrich let out a small laugh.

 

“That’s a sexually transmitted disease, isn’t it?”

 

Given Gwen’s promiscuous nature, it wasn’t entirely surprising.

 

“How is he?”

 

“Not good.”

 

“How bad?”

 

“Very.”

 

“Is he close to death?”

 

“Ulrich.”

 

“Judging by your reluctance to answer, I guess he is.”

 

The lady confirmed with silence.

 

Ulrich, resting his chin on his hand, turned to look out the window.

 

Gwen’s death, huh.

 

It was he who always spoke of suicide, but now it was his brother whose life was in danger. Life was truly unpredictable. Has Gwen written a proper will? If not, perhaps he should subtly intervene now. As he pondered this, his mother spoke again.

 

“So, Ulrich.”

 

“Yes.”

 

“You need to get married.”

 

Ulrich couldn’t believe his ears. The sudden shift in topic left him momentarily stunned.

 

“You know that Gwen is engaged to the young lady of the Schwaben family.”

 



 

“I’ve only informed them of Gwen’s condition, but the Schwaben Marquis seems uneasy. There are reports that he’s been attending social gatherings he rarely went to since the engagement. We need to present an alternative before he gets any strange ideas.”

 

“Is that alternative me?”

 

“Your marriage was bound to proceed once Gwen got married.”

 



 

“With Gwen in this state, you, as the second son, must take over his succession duties. Handling your marriage simultaneously isn’t a bad idea.”

 

“Do you desire the Schwaben family’s gemstone mines that much?”

 

“I can’t deny it. The assessment my appraiser finally completed indicates that the undeveloped mines will bring in a fortune. It would be foolish to miss out on such wealth.”

 



 

“And the Altahart family cannot afford to be foolish. You understand that, don’t you?”

 

Her assertion, reminding him of the scrutiny on their family, was sharp. Feeling a sudden tension in his neck, Ulrich rubbed it and glanced at the ambiguous corner between the ceiling and the wall.

 

“We’ll meet again soon to discuss the details, Ulrich.”

 

Now, he understood what Daphne meant at the hotel reception party.

 

“So, that’s why…”

 

Thinking of her made his head throb more. His past interest in her had faded, leaving only a weary residue.

 

Still, her carefree simplicity, which he had once found endearing, would now become an irritating thorn. Just anticipating the effort of dealing with her was exhausting, indicating that he had no affection left for her.

 

Yes, it was really bothersome.

 

There was someone else Ulrich wanted to observe 24/7, tied up right in front of him. So why this talk of Schwaben?

 

His lips curled with a crooked smile.

 

“What a shame. I’m already married.”

 

“…What?”

 

“And I have children.”

 

“This is nonsense.”

 

“I have three.”

 

“…Ulrich. What are you talking about?”

 

His mother’s stunned expression quickly regained composure.

 

“You’ve been in Marnia for less than a year. How could you have three children in that time?”

 

She saw through his nonsensical statements as a desperate attempt to avoid the arranged marriage.

 

“That’s a bias, Mother. They could be triplets.”

 

“If nothing else, I know my beloved son is speaking nonsense.”

 



 

“Now, stop this protest and come back to the capital.”

 

“To prepare for a marriage, right?”

 

“That’s not all. As I said, you need to take over the succession duties Gwen was supposed to handle, and time is running out.”

 



 

“You went to Marnia because Gwen refused to hand over the department store management rights. That problem is essentially resolved now, so I don’t see why you need to stay there.”

 

Her gaze was sharp like a well-honed blade. Despite appearing as a whimsical lady lost in her role-playing, she was undoubtedly the head of the Altahart family.

 

They didn’t hesitate to suppress emotions for the sake of the family and wealth. While the sadness over Gwen’s critical condition was not insignificant, maintaining the family’s position was more important. They prioritized ensuring that the family machinery continued to run smoothly over the death of a member.

 

Her stern and dry demeanor in using Gwen’s condition to bring Ulrich back to the capital was a testament to this duty.

 

It might seem cold, but that was how the Altahart family had amassed and maintained their wealth for generations.

 

They took what they wanted with relentless determination and discarded what they didn’t need without hesitation.

 

Ulrich, listening to his mother’s complaints, excused himself, using the bathroom as an excuse. Victor was waiting outside. As he walked past, Victor quickly followed.

 

“Should I have the car ready?”

 

“Before that, I should see my dying brother’s face.”

 

Ulrich’s calm tone made Victor look ashamed.

 

“I apologize for not informing you earlier.”

 

“When did you find out?”

 

“Just last week. The lady was very secretive about this.”

 

“Understandably so.”

 

Ulrich didn’t question further and walked quietly.

 

Navigating the long and complicated corridors without getting lost, he eventually stopped in front of a bedroom.



Knock Knock

 

When he knocked, a businesslike voice from inside asked for his identity. Instead of answering, he flung the door open. His mother’s trusted aide looked startled by the rude intrusion but quickly stepped back when he recognized it was Ulrich.

 

With the obstacle gone, Ulrich walked inside.

 



 

Reaching the bed, he crossed his arms and looked down at it askew.

 

On the bed, bathed in the soft afternoon sunlight, lay Gwen, who was said to be at death’s door. Just as the report had said, his once sturdy frame was severely deteriorated. He seemed to have lost a lot of weight, and his complexion was so pale it was unbearable to look at. It was as if he was showing the slow process of how a human being approaches death.

 

“Syphilis, huh?”

 

Of all the diseases, it had to be that one. It was a headache-inducing revelation. Unless even the god he worshipped was fed up with his merry romps and there was no other explanation for such bad luck, it was almost comically fitting for him.

 

In a way, it was a very appropriate end for him.

 

What goes around comes around, after all.

 

All he’d ever done in life was gamble away all his money at the White Club, where he had people preemptively bribe others to rig games, or take various drugs while indulging with prostitutes in his bedroom. Therefore, it was only fitting that his downfall would be so disgraceful.

 

“I wonder if, next time I see you, you’ll be lying in a coffin instead of a bed.”

 



 

“Before that, I must make sure to get your signed resignation from managing the department store.”

 

In their family, the mention of money could wake anyone from their sleep. It wouldn’t be a bad idea to secure everything firmly in case he miraculously returned from the grave. It was a pragmatic conversation to have in front of a dying brother, but there was no other choice. After all, Ulrich himself was also an Altahart.

 

He leaned forward. A long shadow cast over Gwen’s body lying under the blanket.

 

“It might have been your last wish, but you certainly managed to hold me back.”

 



 

“I hadn’t planned to come back to the capital just yet….”

 

Ulrich muttered ominously to his unconscious brother and then sensed someone’s presence, turning his head.

 

The door connecting to a small room inside the bedroom was open. A child was standing behind the door, peeking in.

 

Ulrich immediately recognized the child as his brother’s illegitimate son.

 

As their eyes met, the child’s shoulders shot up in surprise. He was so startled that they didn’t settle back down for a long while.

 

Ulrich straightened up from leaning over Gwen. The shadow that had stretched menacingly over his brother also retreated.

 

The child pursed his lips as if he might burst into tears. Sensing the child’s anxiety, Ulrich uncrossed his arms and walked towards the door.

 

He stopped just a step away from the child and bent his knees to meet the child’s eye level.

 

“Honestly.”

 

Ulrich slowly extended his hand.

 

He gently patted the platinum-blond hair that was so similar to his own and Gwen’s. The child flinched at the sudden touch but gradually relaxed, feeling no threat in the hand’s movement.

 

“You really make things difficult for everyone….”

 

The child’s innocent eyes darted around, unable to find focus. Watching the child’s genuine confusion, Ulrich murmured quietly,

 

“Irresponsible Gwen Altahart.”

 

After patting the child’s head a few more times, Ulrich left the bedroom.

 

Victor, waiting outside, informed him that the car was ready. Ulrich headed straight for the exit. He briefly told a servant following him that he had urgent business and then got into the car, taking out his pocket watch.

 

Even if they drove nonstop from now on, they would only reach Marnia after dark.

 

His fingers tapped the side of the pocket watch as if measuring something. It was a close call. Somehow, the inside of his heart thumped. It had been a while since he felt this kind of thrill.

 

“Victor.”

 

“Yes, sir.”

 

“Find out if there are any long-term hospital rooms available at the Royal Capital Hospital.”

 

“Hospital rooms, sir?”

 

“Yes,” Ulrich replied, turning his gaze out the window.

 

As he looked at his brother lying there, rotting like a corpse, what surprisingly came to his mind was a complete stranger. It was the villa in Marnia where he had spent a few months; someone else was bedridden there in a similar condition to his brother.

 

And he kept thinking of the small nape of someone who stayed by that bed no matter the rain or snow. The nape with hair that used to be well-groomed but now often left unkempt as if they had given up on caring for themselves.

 

“Have you… ever loved anyone?”

 

The violet eyes that looked at him.

 

Ulrich quietly smiled, gazing indifferently out the window.

 

Love.

 

He occasionally saw people in love.

 

Sometimes he heard about it through rumors, and sometimes he witnessed it with his own eyes.

 

Despite their different forms and stories, they all had one fatal commonality.

 

They were all out of their minds.

 

People in love often did crazy things.

 

It was as if that absurdly childish and crude emotion grabbed the person’s brain and shook it wildly.

 

Ulrich hated such things.

 

It was nothing but disgraceful and pathetic.

 

Whenever he saw those who voluntarily jumped into the fire under the guise of such illogical emotions, all he felt was cold contempt that made his entire body freeze.

 

Naturally, acceptance and understanding were out of the question.

 

Above all, that emotion was too fragile.

 

For an Altahart, who had to deal with people all their life, it was an unnecessary attitude and condition. Being in love meant having a weakness. Letting someone else hold your heart was an incredibly dangerous thing.

 

You didn’t have to look far.

 

Just look at Lisbell Osborne.

 

Because she loved her mother and her fiancé, she was constantly pushed around. Her pitiful and wretched state was the result of her love, which she talked about so much.

 

Ulrich had no desire to end up like that.

 

That’s why he openly laughed at Lisbell’s assertion that he had never been in love. There was nothing to offer but a contemptuous smirk to someone who bragged about something he never even wanted.

 

The car’s engine purred softly.

 

Imagining the situation waiting for him in Marnia, Ulrich leaned back comfortably in his seat.



Swish.

 

Lisbell’s gaze, which was fixed on her book, lifted.

 

Perhaps it was just a momentary whim of the weather, but a heavy rain, which hadn’t been predicted earlier, was now pouring down outside the window.

 

She tried to read her book again but soon gave up.

 

The sound of rain invading the bedroom was louder than expected, swallowing up her tiny voice. She could speak a little louder, but at the moment, she didn’t feel the energy for it.

 

She just accepted it.

 

Though she knew getting used to giving up wasn’t beneficial, she was too tired to fight every little thing.

 

It had been like this since Theodore had visited. The small hope she had held onto like grains of sand slipped through her fingers, and she had no will left to grab onto anything again.

 

Since that day, Lisbell had picked up the telephone several times only to put it back down. She kept hesitating, torn between telling Theodore the truth now or fearing it was too late.

 

If she had meant to hold on, she should have followed him that day. Since giving up at that moment, the relationship had irreparably fractured.

 

Even though she desperately wanted to fix it, her current situation made it impossible. It would only lead to the same cruel repetition.

 

So Lisbell let Theodore go little by little.

 

Even if he left, she still had someone left.

 

“Mother.”

 

Lisbell, putting her book down, grasped her mother’s dry hand on the blanket. It still lacked any warmth. As she massaged her mother’s hand, hoping for better blood circulation, her eyes darkened. She thought of the man who had saved her mother’s life but had, in return, thrown her into the mud.


He wasn’t at the villa at the moment. Two days ago, he had to leave for an appointment in the capital. He said it would take about three days, so he would return to Marnia either today or tomorrow.

 

That fact occasionally returned as a bitter reality.

 

The reason was her own appearance, still staying in a corner of this villa even though he was not here.

 

There was nothing physically holding her, but Lisbell was trapped in this villa. An inescapable reality tied her tightly to this place, which felt like a prison.

 

Still, until recently, she seemed to have held onto some faint hope, but now she wasn’t sure.

 

Would the day come when her mother would regain consciousness and open her eyes?

 

Was she clinging to a hope that was too much like ashes?

 

She couldn’t even hold it tight because she was scared, but even if she did, it would eventually shatter. Was she holding onto such a fragile hope?

 



 

It was then.

 

Lisbell’s eyelashes fluttered.

 

“…Mother?”

 

She felt a faint movement in her mother’s fingers, which she had been holding and rubbing for a long time.

 

Was it an illusion?

 

Was it really an illusion?

 

Forgetting even the worn-out hope she had been chewing over, Lisbell stood up suddenly.

 

“Mother… Mother!”

 

Her voice, already delicate and now cracked like parched land from not speaking to anyone for nearly two days since Ulrich left, desperately called out. Responding to her call, her mother’s fingers twitched once more.

 

Lisbell hurriedly looked at her mother’s face. As if nerves that had been asleep for a long time were waking up one by one, strength entered here and there. Soon, her mother’s eyelids gradually lifted. Lisbell, seeing the purple eyes she hadn’t seen since they returned to Marnia, felt a surge of emotion.

 

“Mother, are you coming to your senses?”

 

Having been unconscious for quite a while, her mother couldn’t come to her senses right away. After a long period of numbness, her eyes, which barely regained focus, looked at her daughter who was holding her hand desperately.

 

She opened her dry lips. No sound came out. Perhaps because her vocal cords were strained from not being used for so long, only a dry, raspy sound escaped.

 

“Wait, just a moment. I’ll get you some water.”

 

Lisbell propped her up and quickly grabbed a water glass. After filling it up, she brought it to her mother’s lips and tilted it. Her mother couldn’t swallow well even then. As she coughed, Lisbell wiped the wet corners of her mouth with a handkerchief.

 

“Are you okay?”

 

“Lisbell.”

 

The name her mother managed to call out, after barely stopping her cough, reached her ears.

 

Ah, why does it feel so dreamlike to hear this voice calling me? Lisbell’s eyes filled with tears, unsure whether from longing or relief. As she quietly wiped them away, Mrs. Osborne’s eyes, seemingly becoming clearer in consciousness, looked around.

 

“Where…?”

 

“This is Marnia Villa. The place where you used to work, Mother.”

 

“What on earth… happened?”

 

“Don’t you remember? Mother, you collapsed.”

 

“What?”

 

“Why didn’t you tell me?”

 



 

“Why didn’t you say a word about being unwell…?”

 

Why didn’t you say anything…?

 

Her voice, choked with sobs, was cut off.

 

Mrs. Osborne, sensing how the secret she had desperately wanted to hide had been revealed, let out a small sigh.

 

“It seems I’ve caused you worry.”

 

“They said you collapsed while working. Your condition was so bad that you went straight into surgery.”

 

“Surgery…? I had surgery? Then, how did we manage the cost?”

 

Lisbell smiled bitterly at her mother, who couldn’t help but bring up money even in this situation.

 

“…Mr. Altahart helped us.”

 

“The master did?”

 

“Yes.”

 

“So… that’s why I’m here?”

 

Her mother seemed clueless about everything. It was natural. Although many things had happened to Lisbell, it was all during the time her mother was unconscious. In a way, the foundation of this situation was laid before she collapsed, but Lisbell had kept it a secret, so there was no blame to place on her mother.

 

“The master is….”

 

“He’s not here right now.”

 

“Not here?”

 

“He went to the capital.”

 

“…What is going on…? Anyway, it seems the master took care of me. Did he contact you to come here? And you’ve been by my side since then? What’s the date today? How long have I been unconscious?”

 

Lisbell, calmly tidying up her mother’s wrinkled blanket, spoke.

 

“Summer has just passed.”

 



 

“Autumn will be here soon.”

 

Her mother’s fussy actions suddenly stopped. The mention of the change in seasons carried a clear implication.

 

The one who knew better than anyone that her daughter would be a bride in late summer was Mrs. Osborne. She also knew that her daughter was supposed to leave for another country after the wedding.

 

It was something that should have happened before the end of summer. So the fact that her daughter was still here could only mean one thing.

 

“Lisbell, you…”

 

“I’m breaking off my engagement with Theo.”

 

“…Is it because of me?”

 

“It’s not like that.”

 

Lisbell reached out to calm her mother, who was already sinking into grief. Pulling up the blanket that had slipped down her body, she whispered softly.

 

“It was my decision.”

 

“Lisbell.”

 

“So you don’t need to worry, Mother.”

 



 

“Please lie down, Mother. You just woke up, and if you strain yourself like this….”

 

“Lisbell!”

 

As Lisbell was about to turn away to contact the doctor staying in the annex, her wrist was grabbed.

 

The strength was quite strong for someone who had just woken up. It showed how desperate her mother was.

 

“Tell me honestly. Have I become a burden to you…?”

 

Looking down at her mother’s emaciated hand, Lisbell gently placed it back and covered it with her palm.

 

“It’s okay, Mother.”

 



 

“Really, it’s all okay.”

 

Her voice was hollow. It felt that way because she tried to keep as much emotion out of it as possible.

 

But this was the best. Her mother had been unconscious for a long time and had just opened her eyes. Even though she had recovered enough to communicate after the long rest, she still needed to be careful. And the truths she had to reveal would undoubtedly be too much for her mother.

 

“Sleep a little more, Mother.”

 

Hold on.

 

It’s not the right time yet.

 

So hold on, endure, and persevere, and then, when everything seems back to normal….

 

Lisbell’s hand, pulling up the blanket, hesitated. A sense of despair briefly crossed her mind, wondering if such a day would ever come for her. Mrs. Osborne, who had been silently watching her daughter, caught her hesitation.

 

“The air is a bit chilly. If you feel cold, use this blanket….”

 

“Why….”

 



 

“Why are you so… thin?”

 

Mrs. Osborne’s small question froze Lisbell.

 

“Lisbell, was your wrist always this thin…?”

 

That one sentence was the problem.

 

All the fabricated sentences, busy trying to fill everything with lies, evaporated from her mind. At that moment, hearing those words, she felt as if she was hitting an insurmountable wall. Along with occasional feelings of injustice and futility.

 

Why did she have to swallow everything?

 

If she hid it from Theodore and even from her mother, whom could she confide in about this endlessly turbulent turmoil inside her?

 

Drip Drip

 

Tears suddenly poured out. Lisbell quickly covered her mouth with her hand. She knew she had to stop, but it wasn’t working. Rubbing her tear-filled eyes, she spoke incoherently.

 

“No, this is, this is just….”

 

“Lisbell.”

 

Her mother’s voice, unlike her own tearful one, was firm. She looked up with deeply trembling eyes. Mrs. Osborne, having sensed the discord, silently held Lisbell’s wrist tightly.

 

The strength was stronger than Lisbell had vaguely imagined. It felt like a signal that she wouldn’t collapse even after hearing her confession. Even knowing it was just a fragile mind wanting to depend, Lisbell, as if mesmerized, opened her mouth. It was right to say she couldn’t hold out any longer.

 

“The truth is, actually….

 

Tears rolled down her cheeks and fell onto the bedding covering her mother.

 

She didn’t even know what she was saying. Relying on the hot tears, she poured out the things she hadn’t been able to tell anyone, incoherently.

 

With her head bowed low, she couldn’t see her mother’s expression. She couldn’t bear to look. Even knowing that her mother’s face would be as contorted as her own, she knew it was irrevocable. It wasn’t possible, and she realized she didn’t have enough energy left inside.

 

It was at that point.

 

Without even realizing it, she had collapsed to such a point.

 

After a heavy confession, only the cold air remained in the bedroom. She could easily picture her mother, completely pale from head to toe, after learning the truth. As regret, spreading like a bruise from inside, took over.

 

“Why….”

 

A faint but undeniable warmth touched her cheek. Lisbell flinched and looked up. Her vision, blurred with tears, was cloudy.

 

So she couldn’t see her mother’s expression, but she could sense it.

 

“Why didn’t you say anything?”

 



 

“Why didn’t you tell me….”

 

She finally understood.

 

Her mother’s stubborn refusal to mention her own condition was no different from her own determination to hide every setback she faced.

 

No, it was a mirror image of her own actions.


Lean and frail, Lisbell leaned on those diligent hands trying to wipe away her tears and completed her confession. Her mother, unable to hide her shock, occasionally stiffened her expression and soon after, tears welled up in her own eyes.

 

“Oh my god, the master…”

 

Unable to continue, the lady clutched her chest with a clenched fist, unable to bear it. Lisbell, unable to wipe away her own tears, tried to calm her mother, fearing that even such actions might strain her.

 

“I should have been honest from the start. If I had, things wouldn’t have gotten this bad…”

 

“Lisbell, you don’t need to eat yourself up over it.”

 



 

“I think I understand how we both feel now…”

 

Lisbell’s heart ached. She bit her lip, then nodded carefully.

 

Mrs. Osborne, who was gently stroking her daughter’s pale cheek, looked out the window. Watching the now lighter rain, she suddenly spoke.

 

“Let’s leave together.”

 

“…What?”

 

“I can’t leave you in this place any longer.”

 



 

“Before the master returns… we should quickly gather our things and leave.”

 

Lisbell was taken aback.

 

“But, but mother. I have a contract with him. And mother, you just woke up. Your condition…”

 

“Don’t worry about me. It’s not as bad as you think.”

 

To prove her point, her mother swung her legs out of bed. Lisbell quickly moved to support her. With her help, her mother stood up slowly and took a few steps around the bed.

 

“You said the problem was my surgery and hospital bills. If we break the contract, we’ll just have to repay that money. We’ll leave this place together… and pay it off gradually. That’s what we’ll do. No matter how long it takes, as long as we can repay it, there’s no reason for you to be treated this way.”

 

Lisbell was momentarily stunned. It was something she couldn’t handle alone, something that had always brought her to her knees. Her mother was discussing it so easily.

 

It’s not something that can be handled so easily.

 

Doubt grew from the adversities Lisbell had to face here.

 

But only for a moment.

 

Before her mother regained consciousness, there were many things that gave her psychological pressure. The overwhelming costs and the confession she couldn’t bring herself to make to Theodore.

 

But now her mother had opened her eyes, and now that she had given up her future with Theodore, there was no reason to be held back by that fact.

 

In other words, I am free…

 

“Is it really… okay?”

 



 

“Can I, can I leave this place?”

 

A fine ray of light seeped into Lisbell’s cloudy eyes. Mrs. Osborne gently stroked her daughter’s hair and said.

 

“Of course.”

 



 

“You, Lisbell, you don’t have to be tied to anyone like this. Especially not because of me.”

 

The hope that seemed impossible alone was now overflowing just because her mother had opened her eyes.

 

Having made a decision, her heart grew impatient. Although she had regained consciousness, her mother was still an invalid with limited mobility. To head to the train station with her, they had to hurry.

 

Though unspoken, mother and daughter shared the same thought: this had to be done before Ulrich returned to Marnia.

 

Even if Ulrich escalated the issue to a lawsuit, as long as their intent to repay was communicated, they would manage. First, they had to escape from this place filled with bad memories and psychological pressure to see any sign of a new beginning. Her mother surely thought the same.

 

Lisbell went to her room and opened her suitcase. She packed a few pieces of clothing and some travel money, then grabbed an umbrella from the wardrobe.

 

Fortunately, the rain was light.

 

“Mother, hold onto my arm tightly. If it feels too rushed, let me know immediately.”

 

Lisbell wrapped a cape around her mother’s shoulders to protect her from the cold weather and stepped out.

 

The gate was open, probably for Ulrich’s return today or tomorrow. Lisbell, tightly supporting her mother to prevent her from falling, passed through the gate.

 

It was unbelievable. She never imagined she would leave the villa with her mother so safely.

 

Then, Mrs. Osborne coughed.

 

“Are you okay?”

 

“Don’t worry about me. Let’s go.”

 

Reading Lisbell’s worried gaze, Mrs. Osborne smiled. Even that pale smile was worrisome. They needed to reach the train station quickly to let her rest.

 

Leaving the iron gate, they soon entered a narrow path. Due to the heavy rain, the ground was muddy. Supporting her coughing mother, Lisbell walked along the path heavily scented with rain.

 

After the narrow path, a vast meadow stretched out, with a winding road running through it.

 

On days without rain, she occasionally saw carriages passing by. She hoped they could catch one.

 

As she heard the leaves shuddering from the raindrops, the narrow path came to an end. Lisbell tilted her umbrella back to survey the surroundings.

 

As her view cleared, the weight of her mother leaning on one arm suddenly increased. Lisbell dropped the umbrella and hurriedly caught her mother.

 

“Mother? Mother!”

 

Mrs. Osborne’s complexion was as pale as a sheet, much worse than before. She trembled all over and then coughed with her last strength.

 

Blood spread around her lips. It was hemoptysis. Horrified, Lisbell hurriedly propped her against a tree trunk.

 

“Mother, what’s wrong…! Mother!”

 

The rain pounded painfully in her ears.

 

Lisbell didn’t think of retrieving the fallen umbrella but frantically checked her mother.

 

But the situation didn’t improve.

 

In fact, it only got worse. Her mother, who had been coughing, was now pale and still, her eyes gently closed.

 

Lisbell knew that face well.

 

The face she had seen almost daily in the cozy bedroom of the villa.

 

The face of her mother who hadn’t regained consciousness after surgery.

 

That face now loomed over her mother like a demon. With trembling hands, Lisbell cupped her mother’s cheeks.

 

Mother, mother.

 

Her faint breaths shattered against the falling raindrops.

 

Mother, mother, mother…

 

Lisbell kept calling. Standing before the vast meadow, she felt trapped in a small box, overwhelmed by a sense of claustrophobia. As the waves of anxiety rose, she let her tears flow, lowering her trembling hands.

 

Slowly, she leaned in.

 

She pressed her ear to her mother’s chest, wrapped in the cape.

 

Thump, thump, thump.

 

It was beating.

 

But.

 

Thump… thump… thump…

 

It was slow. It was slowing down. Her mother’s heartbeat was gradually slowing.

 

Was the anxiety chilling her fingertips creating an illusion?

 

She wished it were so, but it seemed highly unlikely. Her mother had stopped coughing altogether.

 

“No, no…”

 

Please, please.

 

Even as she chanted, the beating in her ears grew fainter. Like a dying flame, it seemed inevitable that it would finally go out.

 

Lisbell turned her head blankly in the midst of the relentless downpour.

 

Toward the villa.

 

There was a doctor there. If she carried her mother and ran now, sprinted with all her might, she might save her.

 

But… she couldn’t bring herself to act.

 

Go back?

 

Again?

 

To that villa?

 

No.

 

How could she go back after finally escaping?

 

I don’t want to.

 

What determination had it taken to leave?

 

Never…

 

I don’t want to go back.

 

To that place that sucked the meaning out of everyday life, never…

 

“uh…”

 

She felt nauseous. The situation that kept forcing her into such lowly choices made her shudder with all her heart.

 

Even now, with her mother’s heartbeat slowing to a stop in front of her, Lisbell clutched her head. A soundless scream burst from her open lips. It felt like the scene in the drawing room was repeating itself. As if she were trapped in a very bad, helpless prank.

 

The rain poured heavily.

 

Earlier, it seemed bearable, but now it felt like a torrential downpour, crushing her body unbearably. The rain-soaked her hair and seemed to penetrate her brain. Her body grew heavy and wet. The temperature of the rain was as cold as ice. Her body, drenched in it, cooled down.

 

And so did her heart.

 

“…Mother.”

 

No response.

 

“Mother.”

 

No matching gaze.

 

“Mother…”

 

In front of this despicable display, her vile nature.

 

If I give you up, I don’t have to return to that hell, do I…


Tok.

 

A raindrop, precariously hanging on the edge of a leaf, fell onto Lisbell’s head.

 

“”

 

At that moment, she experienced a feeling of her heart plummeting to the ground.

 

Startled, she fell backward, landing on her backside. Without even thinking of adjusting her clothes soaked in the muddy puddle, she covered her mouth with her hand.

 

Feeling as if she were seeing a detached soul, an eerie and shivering sensation washed over her, and Lisbell was seized by the impulse to peel off her own skin. A wave of guilt washed over her, gnawing at her like bitter bile.

 

How could this happen?

 

No matter how the situation turned out, how could she even think of abandoning her mother…

 

She felt like a horrible monster.

 

Facing the freedom she wanted to reclaim, she was about to abandon her only blood relative. In other words, she was choosing a cowardly escape over the evident way to save her mother, overwhelmed by extreme selfishness. Even amidst this, she despised herself for only wanting not to return to that villa.

 

Unable to move forward or backward, Lisbell collapsed weakly. In the rain that seemed to wash away her senses and melt her very existence, she was sinking deeper, almost to the point of being buried under the ground.

 

A round violet light gathered above the trees.

 

Through the pouring rain, a car quietly appeared.

 

The source of the violet light near the tree her mother was leaning against was the car’s headlights. The engine sound pierced through the noise of the rainwater and settled.

 

The car stopped in front of the path, and the back door opened.

 

A black umbrella popped up. Unlike herself, who was struggling even to avoid a single drop of rain, the man who got out of the car, Ulrich, had returned to the villa before she could escape and was calmly standing there, avoiding the rain.

 

What she couldn’t even dream of avoiding was something he could handle with a mere gesture.

 

A new awareness struck her as a fresh despair.
