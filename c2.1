It was ridiculous. Such a simple act made him feel like his heart, not his head, had been struck.

 

‘It feels like a first kiss…’

 

The more he thought about it, the more it felt that way.

 

Before, it was obvious when she was forced, but today, it wasn’t particularly noticeable. He thought he should find out why she suddenly became so compliant, but before that, the primal lust that made the veins in his pen!s swell took precedence.

 

Lisbell let out a faint moan. It was the moment when her body, which had been lifted high in the air, was laid back on the bed. However, the moan was swallowed before it could properly escape, as Ulrich immediately followed her and devoured her lips again.

 

Her upper lip was sucked with a force that felt like it would tear. His tongue rudely invaded, tickling her even teeth with its rough taste buds. Their lips met again, sticking together tenderly.

 

“Hngh…”

 

The thin fabric of her slip, which barely concealed her skin, was lifted. As Ulrich continued to kiss her, nibbling and holding her, he gradually moved down. When his platinum hair brushed her neck, he immediately sucked on her nipple.

 

“Ah!”

 

Lisbell arched her back, letting out a nasal sound. Her ashen hair, uneven in length, spread evenly across the sheets. Had Ulrich seen it, he might have been tempted to gather it in his mouth and chew on it, but unfortunately, at that moment, his attention was entirely absorbed by her barely visible nipples under the slip.

 

Despite her flat and modest chest, the small nub was endearingly firm. It was a pleasure to roll it with his tongue and graze it with his teeth until it was slick with saliva.

 

“Ugh, hm…”

 

She let out a suppressed moan. In the bedroom, where the air was dry and chilly, the signs of life finally began to mix in.

 

Ulrich bit down on the slip covering her belly and pulled it up to her neck. Although not overly ample, her breasts had a distinct volume that could properly arouse a man’s lust. They were now exposed to his gaze.

 

Her coral-colored nipples were temptingly erect, inviting attention. Ulrich pressed down on them with his hand, rubbing the slightly indented center.

 

After a moment, he bent down and took the hardened nipple into his mouth, sucking and rolling it while his hand moved downward. His middle finger, slightly bent at the tip, parted the sparse pubic hair and pressed deeply into the tender entrance.

 

“Hah…!”

 

“Hmm.”

 

Their breaths escaped simultaneously, one urgent and the other hesitant. Ulrich pushed his fingers into the dry, stiff flesh and twisted them around. No matter how much he sucked and bit her nipple, there was little change, so he eventually lowered his position.

 

Lisbell’s legs were lifted high into the air.

 

Her right ankle, which had become accustomed to being in a cast due to a complete fracture, and the shackle that clinked with a discordant noise every time it moved, emphasizing its isolation, filled his view. In that state, he forcefully sucked below.

 

“Ugh, ugh… hm.”

 

Ulrich’s tongue, which had been licking around her entrance, traced the fissure inside her groin before slowly entering. He moved his tongue in and out as if he were thrusting his pen!s. The sensation of the soft flesh slipping and sliding inside was intensely peculiar.

 

Every time his tongue brushed the tender parts of the inner walls, it felt like it touched a sensitive spot, making her legs twitch. The chains clattered and swayed with each movement. The sound, like something being thinly sliced, brought a sharp chill to her chest.

 

He adjusted his grip on Lisbell’s ankles. As her legs closed tightly, her labia also plumply closed together. Ulrich buried his nose in between, believing that sweet nectar flowed within. The sound of him greedily slurping echoed loudly in their ears.

 

The foreplay wasn’t long. As he buried his face between her legs, fully intent on devouring her, Ulrich quickly unbuttoned his shirt. Like the violent rhythm of a beast, he shrugged off his shirt roughly, his hand naturally falling to his belt buckle.

 

His pen!s, clean and unblemished, was pulled out. When he stroked it, the pre-cum beading on the head grew thicker. The clear, viscous liquid ran down the side of the cock.

 

It was a clear sign that he wanted to plunge inside her and rub against her until he was fully spent. The smooth, hairless organ soon glistened with a slippery sheen.

 

“Aah…!”

 

He forcefully spread Lisbell’s thighs wide and pressed his flushed, red pen!s head against her twitching entrance. The blunt tip was slightly strained as it pushed into the tight flesh.

 

With a quick thrust of his hips, the shaft sank in halfway. A breath, whose origin was unclear, escaped into the air.

 

“It’s so tight.”

 

“Hngh, ugh…”

 

“Relax a little. Hah, it feels like it’s going to snap.”

 

“Hngh… ah…!”

 

He briefly uttered a sharp word and knelt up. The direction of his buried pen!s changed, and the rounded tip scratched at a strange spot inside. The sensation of being deeply squeezed made Ulrich let out a sharp breath.

 

“Should I c*m once? It might be better to wet it a bit first.”

 

Finding it too tight, he gently grasped the penis half-buried in the dry flesh, stroking it as if to masturbate. He even cupped his densely packed testicles in his palm, squeezing them to encourage ejaculation.

 

Lisbell lowered her eyes deeply. Ulrich, gazing down at her face, which seemed innocent yet fully aware of the impact inside, suddenly began thrusting.

 

Her delicate features instantly crumpled. Seeing her finally react, he wore a sly smile.

 

The thick organ stretched the ridiculously small entrance with sharp thrusts, pushing beyond what seemed manageable. With a skilled twist, he pried open her insides as he straightened his back.

 

The flesh pierced at a sharper angle, forcing open the tight inner walls. The entrance, usually too dry to fully close around him, gradually relaxed as it stretched wider with each thrust.

 

“Hngh… ah…!”

 

Ulrich didn’t miss the opportunity, lowering his licked fingers. Spreading her pubic hair, he pressed firmly on the small nub above her labia, rolling it with his fingers.

 When he directly touched her clitoris, an electrifying pleasure coursed through her belly, making her inner walls throb and tighten around his cock. The thing inside her twitched as if rejoicing at being inside.

 

He followed through by letting a lump of saliva, created by scraping the inside of his cheek with his tongue, drip out.

 

“…Ah…!”

 

Lisbell’s stiff body, which had been rigid like a piece of driftwood washed ashore, gradually loosened up. Ulrich, smiling as if pleased with this, thrust himself in more deeply.

 

The soft spot where the tip of his cock squirmed in felt particularly tender as it slid in. When he repeatedly struck that spot, targeting it, red marks appeared on her pale skin. Each time, as if the pleasure that had taken over her long ago swelled inside, she would tighten her belly in sync with his pounding.

 

“Mm, ah, ah…! Ngh…!”

 

The mixing of his pre-cum and her sticky fluids from the friction of his dick against her inner walls began to create a lewd squelching sound at their joining point.

 

Splish, splash. Now that the inside had finally become slick enough to move smoothly, Ulrich habitually grabbed her ankle and twisted it.

 

“Ah… Aah…!”

 

The coquettish moan that had been flowing from her suddenly turned into a stiff cry. Ulrich, who had tried to change her position to one more comfortable for penetration, unconsciously realized that he had grabbed her broken foot and loosened his grip. A displeased sigh followed.

 

“Because of your leg, this is, ngh, becoming a problem.”

 

“Ah, mm… Ah…”

 

“There’s no position we can do other than this, haah.”

 

Although he grumbled in discontent, his vulgar hip thrusts, twisting her lower body, didn’t stop. As if the only place he could find vitality was inside her, his heated, rigid cock rubbed and ground against her vaginal walls without rest.

 

As he glanced down at the already swollen entrance that had been struck a few times, Ulrich’s lips curled into a sly smile.

 

“I’ll carry you… ngh, should I break your leg a bit more?”

 

His hand slowly moved up her milk-white calf, eventually grabbing her right ankle, which was tightly wrapped in bandages. Lisbell’s gut turned cold as she swallowed down the intense revulsion that surged up, even suppressing her breathing.

 

As the vivid and tumultuous pain of that time when her ankle had been twisted and broken in the dim chapel resurfaced, her vision darkened.

 

As her entire body froze solid, the muscles between her buttocks tightened, clenching around his thick cock. Ulrich let out a wicked moan, squinting one eye in apparent pleasure.

 

“I’m kidding, so relax your hole; you’re too tight. Heh… How adorably scared you are.”

 

Whether it was truly just a nasty joke or not, he casually smiled while his hands roughly repositioned her buttocks on the sheets.

 

“Do you want to spread your legs a little more? I want to go in harder.”

 

Though his tone seemed to coax her, his hand roughly pressed down on her thigh. Lisbell’s lower body spread wide open as if it had become one with the sheets.

 

Taking full advantage of the now accessible entrance, he braced himself on the bedpost and thrust deeply into her slick interior. A sticky heat rose from where they were joined.

 

“Ah, mm, ah…!”

 

As the thick cock plunged into her like an iron hook, rudely battering the passageway leading to her womb, her heart felt like it was being dug out. Lisbell looked up at the man with hazy eyes, at the man who nonchalantly made horrifying jokes that threatened to dull her consciousness.

 

Her gaze did not focus on one point but scattered. Every time she saw him, she also saw her own foot draped over his shoulder.

 

At first, it appeared to be her right foot, wrapped in bandages, but then it seemed like her left foot, shackled to prevent her from leaving this place. Eventually, it became difficult to tell which foot was which.

 

It just felt as if her entire body was being tossed around like a worn-out straw doll. Her insides churned, and a deep nausea, akin to seasickness, welled up.

 

Her wavering gaze soon returned to the man’s face. His sharp features, as meticulously crafted as a jewel, were fully aroused as he took possession of her stiff body, which had become rigid like a shattered fragment.

 

His slightly roughened eyebrows, the wild jawline that tensed occasionally, and the overflowing lust in his eyes were so blatant that anyone could see the lustful residue lingering in them.

 

Not only his face but also the palpable weight of the flesh thrusting endlessly between her thighs conveyed his sexual urge.

 

She had expected this.

 

Lisbell had anticipated that he would be aroused to a certain extent, but now that things had turned out exactly as she had predicted, she felt a slight sense of satisfaction, despite her miserable state. She could now more clearly understand what the man wanted from her.

 

In truth, what Ulrich wanted from her had been clear from the beginning.

 

“If we’re going to have sex, it’s better if we both enjoy it.”

 

“If your fiancé is gone, shouldn’t you be able to enjoy it more freely?”

 

He wanted her to lose her conscience.

 

He wanted her to lose herself, to become one with him, to wriggle in the hellish pleasure.

 

It wasn’t because he was uncomfortable with her trying to live without losing her conscience. He simply had a primal desire to see her fall deeply into depravity.

 

That was his world, after all.

 

The world where he lived, breathed, indulged, and wallowed—a paradise of depravity.

 

Now that she had finally tasted the pleasure of someone acting exactly as she expected, Lisbell quickly realized that to catch him off guard and find a gap, she too would have to cross that boundary. Nothing less would suffice. She had already prepared herself for the fact that he would not be an easy opponent, as she gathered the shattered pieces of her heart.

 

“…Mm?”

 

Lisbell’s hand quietly lifted.

 

As Ulrich, who had been busy thrusting his cock into her with all his might, suddenly stopped his actions.

 

His clear eyes, which seemed to be unable to comprehend the situation, slowly slid toward where she was pointing. At the end of his gaze was Lisbell’s palm, clasped around Ulrich’s collarbone.

 

Lisbell gently caressed the sturdy collarbone that had emerged robustly like a beast’s hide, contrasting with his pale, porcelain-like skin.

 

Although his face was delicate and beautiful, the man’s body was solid and well-toned, like a weapon forged and tempered evenly, with no weak spots.

 

In the next moment, Ulrich’s lips curved into a smooth, almost irresistible smile.

 

Seemingly deeply moved by the fact that her hand was touching some part of him, he displayed an expression as warm as a spring sunbeam, and then immediately seized her hand, bringing it to his cheek.

 

Not stopping there, he tilted his head slightly so that her palm would brush against his lips.

 

It was an affectionate and familiar kiss, starkly contrasting with the scars left by shattered glass shards, where red sorrow and dark blue melancholy swirled and pulsed.

 

When he pulled his lips away with a soft “smack” Lisbell lowered her hand again.

 

As she fiddled with his collarbone, which had grown masculine and prominent like his broad shoulders, she felt his penis stiffen inside her. Twisting her waist slightly in response to the internal stimulation, Lisbell gradually raised her hand.

 

The hand stopped near his nape, where the blood vessels turned a faint blue under the surface, covering the area where his lips had just touched. Motionless, as if she were trying to suppress even her own pulse, she felt the subtle yet strong pulse of life throbbing there.

 

It was faint, yet powerful and vigorous.

 

And therefore, all the more uncomfortable.

 

“What are you doing?”

 

Ulrich, who had paused in their intense coupling to watch her, asked.

 

Lisbell subtly moved her hand, trying to conceal her attempt to feel his pulse. She wrapped her arm around his neck. It was indeed a burden to embrace such thickness. She wondered if she could even tear apart this thick hide with her own hands.

 

“…Ugh!”

 

Suddenly, her pelvis was pressed down as her lower body was struck forcefully. Her entire body trembled, and Lisbell’s eyelids quivered.

 

Whether he was overwhelmed by her unusually assertive behavior today, he spoke in a voice wrapped in both suspicion and undeniable pleasure.

 

“Why are you acting like this today? It’s really, haah, strange.”

 

A man who had no resistance to being touched first by others. It was as if she could feel the pent-up thirst that had made him persistently torment her for so long.

 

On one hand, it was amusing. It was so funny that she was on the verge of sneering.

 

Strange, he says. After treating someone so cruelly, did he think she would be fine? That Lisbell had come this far was all because of him.

 “Ugh, ah, ah…! Ah, hng!”

 

The gentle thrusts that had allowed for brief moments of breath suddenly turned intense. The rhythm was completely abandoned, and the speed increased to the point where breathing became disjointed and erratic.

 

He adjusted his posture so drastically that it was as if he were kneeling upright. Lisbell’s lower body, entwined with the man’s, naturally lifted into the air. Her hips, which were connected to the now-wet slit, and even her waist, lifted off the sheets.

 

Ulrich thrust his penis in forcefully. The relentless movement of his hips made it feel like the walls of her vagina were being scraped. The sensitive inner flesh around the penetrating column was stimulated to the point of almost being peeled back, sending a sharp tingle deep into her abdomen.

 

“Ah…! Mm! Ugh, hng…!”

 

Moreover, each time he entered her, now in a more intimate position, a throbbing heat spread inside her, making her lower region pulse. The inner walls, previously filled with pent-up moisture, now released a blatant spray of fluid outside.

 

It was a violent act of sex, barely disguised by the term “passion.” The pleasure dragged out of her against her will was just that—dragged out.

 

“Hng, mm, mm, ah…!”

 

The inside was hit repeatedly. The vulgar electric current recklessly heated the crown of her head. Her vision whitened, and suddenly, tears burst forth. Her cheeks grew wet as pitiful cries filled the bedroom, almost piercing the ceiling. Her hands and feet trembled uncontrollably.

 

Each time Ulrich’s length filled the narrow cavity completely, Lisbell’s most vulnerable parts tightened as if struck. Of course, Ulrich didn’t allow her to relax, instead digging deeper, almost as if he was seizing her climax.

 

“Hng, mm…! Ah, ah, ah…!”

 

Her moans shortened to the point where they could no longer be any briefer. The heat that threatened to melt her overtook her body, causing it to convulse uncontrollably. The air carried an obscene wave.

 

The man, who had been repeatedly plunging into the flesh that eagerly swallowed him, suddenly drove in with fierce intensity. She felt something wet burst out, soaking her lower region. Between her crossed legs, a thick, lewd scent arose.

 

“Hng…!”

 

As soon as he started to release, Ulrich, now limp over Lisbell’s body, turned his head to the side and muttered something. It was hard to hear, but it seemed like a curse. It was an uncouth word for someone who usually spoke with a deep, aristocratic accent.

 

Perhaps aware of how he was pinning her down with his large frame, he soon propped himself up on the sheets, raising only his upper body. His chest heaved as he tried to catch his breath, and then his hand grabbed her chin. His hot breath, inflamed by arousal, invaded her mouth, wildly swirling around as if to steal away what little air remained.

 

“What is this?”

 

He pulled away from her lips, which had been teasing hers so vigorously that saliva trailed between them, and whispered with a curious tone.

 

“Why do you keep doing these pretty things that don’t suit you…?”

 

The question he had held before the act now finally found voice. He pulled her chin up a bit more.

 

Though he asked, it seemed he wasn’t expecting a proper answer, as he soon left a light bird-like kiss on her lips, lost in thought. When their lips parted, Lisbell whispered in a fragile tone as if she were about to break.

 

“…I want to be at ease.”

 

It seemed Ulrich hadn’t heard her well, as he responded with a drawn-out, “Hmm?”

 

Lisbell fidgeted, curling up under his body.

 

“I… don’t want to hurt anymore.”

 



 

“If I refuse you… you’ll keep hurting me.”

 



 

“So, just….”

 

My throat itches.

 

Unconsciously, she raised her hand to rub the bandage while mumbling.

 

Her tone, dazed and disconnected, passed through her own ears, blending despair and emptiness, as if resigning herself. She hoped that he would perceive it the same way.

 

Ulrich looked down at her in silence. If looks could bore holes, her face would have been pierced by now. He studied her that intensely.

 

Then, he removed her hand from her neck and stood up from the bed.

 

When he returned, still half-naked, wearing only his pants, his lips met hers again. But this time, instead of a tongue, a lukewarm liquid flowed into her mouth. As she swallowed, her throat tingled and burned. The dense scent of liquor filled the air. She finally realized he had given her the drink she had requested.

 

“You’ve made a good decision.”

 

After swallowing nearly a glass’s worth of liquor, all delivered through a kiss, Ulrich’s face finally came into focus.

 

He was smiling. It reminded her of the eerie laughter that had gnawed at her mind, but it quickly vanished like a mirage. Perhaps because his current smile was too gentle to be considered sarcastic. There was a hint of the spring Lisbell had yet to recover in that smile.

 

“There’s a saying that everything depends on how you accept it.”

 



 

“If you stay by my side, you’ll surely be happy.”

 

Though he spoke with a smile, there was an inexplicable murkiness around his pupils.

 

It was the smoke of doubt.

 

For Lisbell to accept his words so easily would require forgetting the desperate resistance she had shown thus far, which he surely remembered vividly.

 

Yet, she couldn’t entirely shake the joy from her expression. It was a reaction she swallowed along with the poisonous doubt. Lisbell thought how truly despicable he was.

 

But then, so was she. The stench of deceit that had only belonged to him now clung to her as well.

 

“Don’t scratch your neck.”

 

She didn’t realize until Ulrich grabbed her hand and pulled it away again. Whether it was itching, hurting, or just feeling tight, she didn’t know. The faint taste of liquor lingered in the breath she swallowed. That was all she could rely on for now.

 



 

The first thing that came to mind as she reoriented her thoughts, lying still as a mouse, was alcohol.

 

It was the burning pain of the scar that intensified each dawn that reminded her, followed by the deep, unshakeable melancholy that left her in a downward spiral, devoid of any will to stir. Finally, she sought it out to endure the nights she would inevitably spend with Ulrich.

 

Since the day she broke off her engagement with Theodore and drained an entire bottle, Lisbell had sworn off alcohol. The breakup was bad enough, but the mistake she made while drunk that day had been shocking. It was a disgraceful secret she vowed never to let anyone know, one that had tormented her for days.

 

“You were the one who clung to me, Lisbell.”

 

“You kissed me first, don’t you remember?”

 

“You wrapped your legs around my waist, begging me not to go.”

 

Lisbell still had no memory of such things. Nor did she want to. The very thought of it was something she would burn from her mind if it surfaced, leaving only unrecognizable ashes behind, ensuring not even a trace remained.

 

But at this moment, she needed the same level of assertiveness she had shown then.

 

Just as she had been so eager to kiss first and touch his body, making him ecstatic in the past, she began drinking again. A glass a day, even if only as an aperitif.

 

At least she had an excuse to rely on. When the skin on her neck had sizzled under hot wax, she had thought she might die, but now it was useful enough to delay the wedding and justify her drinking.

 

The man had been right about one thing: how you interpret and react to something ultimately depends on your own mind.

 

She knew her thoughts were becoming a bit twisted, but it didn’t matter. After all, being docile by his side was something she couldn’t do in her right mind.

 

It was better to spend her days slightly unhinged, rationalizing her self-destructive thoughts, than to be consumed by endless depression.

 

“I want to read a book.”

 

Lisbell, lying on her side like someone whose life’s posture was laziness, suddenly spoke.

 

The man, who had been fiddling with his cufflinks, looked her way. Sunlight streamed through the window, licking at his body as if in adoration.

 

When he turned his body toward her, his lips curled into a subtle smile. The tender spring light fell on him, exuding an infinite gentleness.

 

“Do you want to spread your legs so I can see?”

 

But contrary to his gentle demeanor, his open mouth issued a crude command as if crafted from vulgarity.

 It was a good idea to have a drink in the morning.

 

Lisbell thought this as she hiked up the slip that only covered half of her thighs. She knew that spreading her legs while the slip was still in place wouldn’t show her what she wanted to see. In the end, he was a man who would push her to vulgar acts to get what he wanted.

 

The flimsy slip slid upward, revealing her hips and the rounded curve of her buttocks. As he approached the bed, she spread her legs to give him a better view. She could feel his ocean-blue eyes roving over her exposed skin.

 

Ulrich’s hand, which had been adjusting his sleeve, dropped, and a stifled breath escaped his lips. With a self-deprecating smile, as if mocking himself for falling into temptation, he crawled between Lisbell’s slender thighs.

 

His slippery tongue licked the still-swollen entrance, the aftermath of last night’s activities. His thorough, persistent licking made her twitch involuntarily.

 

It was revolting how accustomed to pleasure even humans could become. The inside of her stomach began to heat up, and though she felt slightly nauseated, she could manage. The drink she had in the morning helped her maintain her composure, even as she felt herself sinking lower.

 

Ulrich, who had been touching nothing but her tongue, suddenly grasped her knees, spreading them wider. His grip reminded her of his arousal, which was already evident.

 

The sound of his tongue flicking between her legs was unrelenting. Each time he moved his head, his fine platinum hair tickled the sensitive skin of her inner thighs. While the man indulged in her, Lisbell gazed at the ceiling, her mind hazy and unfocused.

 

“You made a good decision.”

 

After that remark, Ulrich’s suspicion persisted steadily from that day onward. He constantly tried to gauge if Lisbell had truly abandoned the hope that lay outside and accepted the tragedy that surrounded her.

 

The routine was always the same.

 

Lisbell would make a demand, and he would propose something in return.

 

Just like when she asked for a drink, Lisbell began to make requests of him, one by one.

 

From specific requests like “I want to bathe alone,” “I want to open the windows whenever I want,” to more meaningless and capricious demands like “I’m bored,” “I’m hungry,” “I’m cold,” she threw out anything that came to mind.

 

Each time, Ulrich would naturally expect something in return—usually something involving her body. Yesterday, she had sucked him off while lying on the bed, and the day before that, they had kissed until her tongue was sore.

 

Of course, Ulrich never stopped at mere teasing.

 

“I’d like to hold the wedding at our hotel. I plan to decorate the banquet hall with sweet peas that will be in full bloom before summer. They’re pink, just like your insides, so you’ll love them.”

 

Sometimes he would bring up the wedding.

 

“By the way, did you have a good conversation with Mr. Mortier? How was he? Did he seem happy with Ms. Hinse?”

 

At other times, he would mention Theodore.

 

Lisbell always remained calm, occasionally adding a “Yes” or “No.”

 

Whenever she responded like that, Ulrich would stare at her, as if trying to dissect her reaction. Though he often smiled, there was always a sharp intensity in his eyes. He seemed desperate to keep testing her.

 

“…Ugh, mm…”

 

Her legs lost all strength. Ulrich, who had buried his tongue deep inside her and was rolling it around until her insides became mushy, finally lifted his head when his lips were thoroughly soaked.

 

“What book?”

 

Seemingly satisfied with his morning activity, Ulrich asked pleasantly, his voice still playful. As Lisbell licked her lips, trying to shake off the tingling sensation between her legs, she answered.

 

“I’d like to choose it myself…”

 

Ulrich, who had been licking her lips, paused.

 

His once indifferent gaze now hardened into a cold stare. He then gave her a smile that was clearly superficial. That’s right, his expression seemed to say, I should have expected this.

 

“Do you want to leave the bedroom?”

 

To the man, that’s what her main intention must have sounded like. Lisbell looked at Ulrich without bothering to pull down her slip, then slowly turned her body away. She lay down, turning her back to him, and muttered indifferently.

 

“Never mind if it’s not allowed.”

 

Ulrich didn’t respond. However, she could feel his icy gaze raking across her back. Lisbell stared blankly at the wall, as if nothing could change her mind.

 

Before long, a shallow sigh broke the silence.

 

“…Ha.”

 



 

“This is just as nerve-wracking.”

 

Her body was suddenly pulled to the edge of the bed. Ulrich had tugged on the chains connected to the bedpost. The sensation of being dragged against her will was always unpleasant and unnerving.

 

By the time she blinked, she found herself pinned beneath him. Ulrich lowered his upper body and bit one of her round buttocks hard. The feel of his teeth sinking into her soft flesh sent chills down her spine.

 

“Well, since you’ve so generously spread those expensive legs…”

 

He spoke as if doing her a favor, and shortly after, he called someone in to bring the shackle key. He must have been too lazy to dress her, as he draped his house robe over her slip-clad body, then swiftly unlocked the shackles.

 

As soon as he finished, Lisbell’s body was lifted into the air.

 

“I’ll carry you instead.”

 



 

“If you don’t want that, we can forget about it.”

 

He raised his eyebrows with a playful smile. It was clear he was eager to see how she would react.

 

Lisbell stared at him closely before slowly moving her arms.

 

Ulrich’s smile quickly faded. When the woman’s thin arms, as fragile as tree branches, wrapped tightly around his neck, he nearly dropped her but quickly regained his composure and adjusted his grip on her.

 

At the same time, he let out a faint chuckle.

 

“…See?”

 

The hand supporting Lisbell’s back pulled her closer into his embrace.

 

“I feel like I’ve never won.”

 

Muttering to himself in self-mockery, Ulrich shook his head slightly as he walked toward the door.

 

Honestly, until they were walking down the corridor toward the library, she wasn’t sure how sincere he would be. She assumed he’d pick out a few books, give instructions to the servants to bring them to the bedroom, and that would be the end of her unexpected outing.

 

But the man surprisingly invested his time with genuine sincerity.

 

He looked over each of the two-story-high shelves, allowing Lisbell to choose the books she wanted. He even recommended some, mentioning they were enjoyable reads. When Lisbell examined the books he handed her, he seemed pleased, rubbing his lips against her temple as if it felt rewarding to have her attention.

 

At one point, Victor entered the library. He seemed to be there to discuss some schedule, but Ulrich dismissed him with an unrecognizable gesture, letting Lisbell continue her leisurely book selection.

 

It was while she was aimlessly wandering through the library, enveloped in Ulrich’s arms, that something caught her eye.

 



 

It was a chessboard set up on a library table. The square grid, square pieces, square layout—everything about it was geometric. The moment she saw the object full of angles, a shiver ran down her back.

 

“Hmm?”

 

Ulrich, noticing that her attention was elsewhere, followed her gaze to the chessboard and asked.

 

“Curious?”

 

As if in a trance, she nodded. Ulrich left the bookshelves and approached the library table.

 

“Have you ever played?”

 

“No.”

 

“Shall I teach you? It’s worth trying.”

 

Ulrich whispered as he toyed with the king piece, moving it to incorrect squares. Lisbell hesitated before slowly lowering her hand. Seeing that she couldn’t reach the chessboard from where she was, Ulrich bent his knees to let her touch it.

 

The cool edge of the square brushed against Lisbell’s fingertips.

 

No.

 

It was too blunt.

 

It was far too dull to pierce the strong, calloused flesh she had once covered with her palm. It seemed sharper from a distance, but it wouldn’t do. The size was also too large for her to wield with one hand. A book corner would be better than this.

 

“…Alright.”

 

Ulrich responded with a soft laugh to her seemingly absent-minded reply.

 When she returned from exploring the library in the morning, the bedroom was filled with sunlight.

 

He naturally found the shackles and attached them to her ankles after laying her down on the bed. Lisbell opened the book she had brought with her, as if his behavior was expected, without frowning once.

 

Ulrich, who stood close by, watched her with a curious gaze. After a moment, he heard someone calling him from outside the door. Ulrich slowly lowered himself and brushed his lips against Lisbell’s shackled instep.

 

“What could it be….”

 



 

“I wonder what’s going on in that little head of yours.”

 

Muttering as if he was genuinely confused, he announced that he’d be right back and planted a kiss on the side of Lisbell’s head before leaving the bedroom. Even at the sound of the door closing, Lisbell didn’t move as she continued reading her book.

 

After several pages, she gently lowered her head.

 

The shackles that had vanished just moments before were now securely fastened, as if by magic. The most tangible proof that her freedom was in his hands.

 

Lisbell shook her shackled foot as if out of habit. The sound of the chain rattling against the edge of the bed was like the crack of a whip.

 

Clank, clank, clank.

 

Clank, clank….

 

The sound ceased, and the ominous vibrations that had echoed through the bedroom subsided.

 

Lisbell lay still as if dead, determined.

 

First, she needed to remove these shackles.

 

Only then did it seem possible to get what she wanted.

 



 

The days passed in leisurely succession.

 

For the man, certainly. But for Lisbell, the days were far from carefree.

 

“…It’s your turn.”

 

Lisbell’s voice, slightly breathless, echoed after moving the white bishop.

 

“Huh? Oh.”

 

Ulrich seemed oblivious to the fact that they were playing chess, preoccupied with toying with Lisbell’s body, which was seated on his lap.

 

Even now, his hands were slipping inside her slip, crudely fondling her flat chest. Her breasts, squeezed repeatedly, were tender, and her nipples, pinched and rolled like toys, had become stiff and protruded through the slip in an obscene manner.

 

It wasn’t until Lisbell’s voice reminded him that it was his turn that his hands withdrew from inside her slip, grasping the black knight. Without hesitation, he made a bold move that quickly overwhelmed the board, easily bypassing the pieces Lisbell had set up.

 

Since returning from the library in his arms, a chessboard had appeared in the bedroom. Ulrich wasn’t much of a teacher. Whenever he tried to explain the rules, he’d take every opportunity to touch her somewhere, and when he was particularly aroused, he’d push the chessboard aside and bury himself between her legs.

 

As a result, it took three days just to learn the basic rules.

 

What started as a simple pastime increasingly puzzled Lisbell.

 

At first, as an inexperienced beginner, losing was only natural. But even as she gradually learned the game, the results remained the same.

 

Even when she thought she had come up with a clever move or a suitable variation, Ulrich would make a single gesture, and all her strategies would crumble, the entire board collapsing in an instant.

 

It was incomprehensible how he managed to win despite his lack of focus, constantly groping or sucking on parts of her body while they played, without any apparent interest in the game. The reason she continued to play chess, despite planning to quit out of frustration, lay in that mystery.

 

A few turns passed. Eventually, Lisbell’s white king was surrounded by his pieces. Checkmate. She was thoroughly defeated. Though it was just a game, her heart sank. The feeling of something breaking inside her, already fragile, was overwhelming.

 

“…Why?”

 

The question slipped out.

 

Ulrich, who had achieved victory with indifferent ease, let out a casual breath as he bit her earlobe.

 

He chuckled softly, as if he had already guessed what was on her mind. His hand, which had slipped between her thighs without her noticing, slowly withdrew and approached the chessboard.

 

“Lisbell, your moves are too predictable.”

 



 

“I can read them after just a glance.”

 

He licked her ear, adding, “Well, that’s part of your charm.” Ulrich’s comment was not something Lisbell particularly cared about. She watched as his hand touched her fallen king.

 

“And you’re too conservative.”

 

His touch was light, driven purely by base curiosity, just as when he toyed with her.

 

“You’re too hesitant to bring your king to the front lines.”

 



 

“It’s obvious how you try to protect and hide what’s precious to you.”

 

Hide the king?

 

Lisbell looked at the chessboard again. Indeed, while her king had barely moved from its starting position, Ulrich’s king had ventured dangerously close to the heart of enemy territory. It was more of an offensive move than one aimed at ensuring safety.

 

“If you want to win.”

 

He knocked over Lisbell’s king. Then, he picked up his own dark king, moving it a square or two to occupy the spot where her king had been.

 

“You have to be bold.”

 



 

“Victory belongs to those who take risks.”

 

It was as if he were coaxing her. Lisbell straightened her fallen king. She remembered a rule she had learned on the first day: the king is the only piece in chess that cannot be captured. When a checkmate occurs, the player declares defeat and topples their own piece.

 

She hadn’t declared defeat, yet her king had fallen. It was as if the fallen king mirrored her own crumbling self, and she couldn’t just leave it lying there.

 

After playing a few more rounds with Ulrich, they were interrupted by a phone call. Lisbell, now seated properly in a chair after getting off his lap, continued moving the pieces, even though her opponent was gone.

 

At one point, her hand slid off the board, and she felt along its edge. Her gaze soon shifted to the glass on the side table, placed there earlier for amusement. She imagined throwing it to the floor, shattering it. She even imagined picking up the sharp shards. The sensation of her healed palms stinging as the wounds reopened was almost palpable.

 

‘…No, that won’t do.’

 

It’s not enough.

 

She quietly moved her hand back, positioning the rook at the edge, lost in thought. When Ulrich returned after a surprisingly long absence, possibly due to an extended meeting, he was startled to find her still sitting by the chessboard, diligently playing.

 

He approached with a wry smile, as if to say she was hopeless.

 

“Is it really that fun?”

 



 

“Should’ve told you sooner.”

 

The chair turned toward him so he could see the chessboard. He lifted her off the chair, his thick arms making it clear that even if she stabbed him with the broken glass, he probably wouldn’t even bleed.

 

“No matter how fun it is, it shouldn’t be more fun than playing with me.”

 

Whenever they played chess, she couldn’t escape a feeling of crushing shame.

 

What am I doing?

 

Is this really the time?

 

I should be finding a way to … as soon as possible.

 

But then, when she saw how Ulrich enjoyed himself without hiding his pleasure, she couldn’t help but think it wasn’t a bad decision after all.

 

After all, her cooperation surely bred a subtle, insidious complacency within him. Just as she had sneaked into enemy territory and surrounded his king without his knowing.

 

Bold and daring, he had said.

 

As Lisbell was moved from the chair to the bed, his words floated through her mind. The chains of the shackles rattled as they stretched far and then wound back to the bed, making a chilling noise. It sounded like a snake slithering through the dark grass towards her feet.

 

“Otherwise, I’d be so disappointed….”

 

His voice poured over her like the afternoon sunlight, lazy and content.

 

Without needing to say much, she could tell that he was thoroughly satisfied with their current life.

 

As she considered how he filled his days with deep satisfaction, her nape began to itch. Lisbell closed her eyes tightly. Her heart pounded lightly. She recalled the sharp pain still lingering in her palms. She remembered the hot blood that had flowed from the open wounds.

 

It didn’t matter if she failed at chess.

 

Winning or losing in such games wasn’t what mattered to her.

 

If she could be bold in reality, if she could achieve what she wanted, then she would ultimately win. She had to endure, to be patient, for that one goal alone.

“Lisbell, wake up now.”

Her temples were gently pressed. Even in her faint consciousness, she could guess that it was the man’s lips.

It was the first time he had woken her since she had returned to this bedroom.

Given that rest was necessary for her injury, and knowing that staying awake would only bring more fatigue, he never attempted to wake her up in the mornings when she wasn’t ready to get up.

So, this morning felt a little special.

Still half-asleep, Lisbell sat up, and Ulrich, already neatly dressed as if ready to go out, swept his tousled hair away with his hand. He kissed her forehead gently and smiled faintly.

“Shall we have breakfast first?”

At first, Lisbell wondered why he had woken her up, but it seemed to be just to have breakfast. He brushed his hand through her hair once more, and she got up from the bed.

Without thinking, she placed her weight on her injured foot and stopped in surprise.

She hadn’t realized it, but the pain in her broken foot had become much weaker. In fact, it was almost completely gone. Before, even the slightest touch would send a sharp, grinding pain through her bones, but now, she could stand perfectly fine on that foot.

“Is your foot all healed?”

Ulrich asked as he reached out his arm to help her but paused mid-motion. Lisbell nodded and sat in the chair he had set out for her.

There was only one serving prepared on the table. She had assumed he woke her up to join him for breakfast, but it seemed that wasn’t the case. She felt puzzled but didn’t ask and picked up the cutlery.

Ulrich lowered himself to sit in front of her chair. Lisbell, breaking off a piece of the crispy crumpet, glanced down. It was clear that the swelling had gone down a lot. Satisfied with his observation, he didn’t re-wrap the bandage but simply placed it aside.

She expected him to stop there, but his hands moved toward her other ankle—the one that had no injury, but still bore the weight of a manacle.

His touch on her uninjured ankle felt awkward. Lisbell mechanically chewed her food, as if suppressing the discomfort.

Her chewing slowed, and a few moments later, the tension in her ankle was released. The tightness eased, and the sense of weight on her ankle vanished, leaving an odd emptiness.

She had been freed from the manacle a few times before. After she had asked to go to the library, Ulrich often removed it when she requested, and he would carry her there in his arms. She didn’t need to think too deeply about this.

Yet, today, something felt different. Ulrich had removed the manacle without any request from her. It was unusual.



As she continued to stare blankly at the floor, Ulrich flicked her nose lightly. That snapped her back to attention, and she slowly resumed eating.

After breakfast, it was as if it was already planned—she was placed in the bathtub. The warm water wrapped around her, lifting her spirits.

Ulrich hummed softly as he washed her, carefully avoiding her neck, which had suffered burns. He washed her limbs, armpits, and every part of her body with great attention, ensuring no spot was missed.

Lisbell, sitting in the water, absentmindedly shook her left ankle, still feeling the strange lightness. The sound of her foot brushing in the water was oddly clear, and the same sound seemed to echo in her mind.

Even after stepping out of the water, she kept shaking her foot. Ulrich chuckled at her actions, straightening his back and bringing a towel from the rack to gently dry her hair.

“The weather’s warmed up a bit, so a blouse and skirt should be fine, right?”

After the bath, it was time to get dressed.

Ulrich moved toward the wardrobe and pulled out several outfits he had already picked out, handing them to her. Although she wasn’t sure of his intentions, Lisbell had no choice but to pick one of the outfits he had chosen.

Once she was dressed, Ulrich led her toward the bedroom door.

“Shall we go?”

He opened the door and spoke.

Where to?

She was burning with the urge to ask, but she held back. An odd tension tightened in her chest. She had a feeling that if she was to make sense of the strange chaos of this morning, she would have to quietly follow Ulrich without asking.

As she walked behind him, her mind drifted.

Is it really right that I’m walking on my own two feet? Could it be that the unbelievable part is my own condition, or the position I’m in? Is it strange that I’m walking normally now, without the manacle or injury? Or is it simply strange that I’m walking through the corridors of this mansion in such a normal state? It was hard to distinguish which one felt more surreal.

She looked at Ulrich’s back ahead of her.

His back, wrapped in a thin shirt for spring, looked so strong that even if she tried to run and leap onto him, it wouldn’t break. The sight made her feel as though her blood had drained and her whole body had wilted, as though standing before an endless desert.

A moment later, Ulrich opened a door to what appeared to be a reception room.

The first thing Lisbell noticed was a clothing rack filled with dresses, tightly packed and seemingly all the same type.

They were all white, with simple frills and lace—delicate but not excessive.

Lisbell’s feet stopped, unable to go any further.

“You’re a little late, Madam. I’m sorry to have kept you waiting.”

The woman standing in front of the clothing rack, giving instructions to an assistant who seemed to be a subordinate, turned toward them with a lively face. She was probably the madam of the tailor shop, invited here by Ulrich.

“You don’t need to apologize. I was so excited and thrilled that I lost track of time waiting,” she said with a bright smile.

Ulrich, smiling as if relieved, looked over at Lisbell, who was still standing by the door. He reached out and gently pulled her forward. Lisbell hesitated but followed, unable to tear her eyes away from the dresses hanging on the rack.

In contrast, the madam’s gaze remained fixed on Lisbell, and she couldn’t seem to look away.

“Oh my, could this be…?”

The madam’s anticipation grew, and Ulrich answered with a soft smile.

“This is my fiancée.”

The madam’s smile deepened. She extended a business card, the size of a palm, and greeted them.

“How do you do? I’m Yvonne, the madam of Rettoile Tailoring. I’ve been looking forward to meeting you ever since I received the request from Mr. Altahart.”

“A request…?”

“Yes. It was a request to make the wedding dress for your wedding.”

Yvonne, with a pleased smile, looked at the two of them, seemingly pleased with how well they matched. Ulrich smiled back. In the meantime, Lisbell could not bring herself to smile.

She didn’t even consider looking at the business card in her hand and kept glancing over at the dresses on the rack.

As expected.

They were all wedding dresses.

“Shall we begin?”

While Lisbell was lost in thought, Yvonne asked Ulrich, turning toward him. Ulrich gestured as though to confirm, then walked over to a sofa in the reception room and sat down. Shortly after, a servant entered and handed him a glass of wine.

“I’ve selected several styles as samples, would you like to pick one, Miss?”

Yvonne kindly spoke to Lisbell, who was still standing stiffly in front of the rack.

Lisbell was filled with a burning desire to crumple the business card in her hand and set fire to the wedding dresses on the rack. But she knew she couldn’t do that.

She had… been pressured countless times already.

By his tongue and its tests.

This was likely just another one of them. If she caused a scene here, everything she had painstakingly achieved, enduring the peeling away of her heart’s shell little by little, would be for nothing.

In a way, this wasn’t entirely bad news. The fact that he was expanding the test like this meant that his heart was also stirred. In other words, he was getting closer to truly being affected. If things continued this way, it seemed that he might easily be deceived by her—she might even end up believing him, which was a dangerous game she had to play carefully.

“Don’t want… don’t want, I don’t want it… no…!”

She vividly remembered how she had screamed and recoiled from his proposal.

If he wanted this, then she had to go along with it.

That way, she would be closer to her goal too. Shaking off the loathing and scorn crawling up from her toes, Lisbell grabbed one of the wedding dresses on the rack.

 “Did you say the flowers to be used as decoration will be sweet peas?”

Yvonne asked Ulrich, who was sitting on the sofa, leisurely swirling a crystal glass with ice in it. Ulrich nodded. Yvonne carefully selected several dresses from the rack. Several flowing dresses were then thrust in front of Lisbell, who stood like a mannequin in front of the mirror.

“Since your skin is so fair, I think these colors might look nice on you.”

“Still, it should at least look like a wedding dress, right?”

“Do you prefer something even whiter than this? Understood.”

Although Lisbell was the one to wear the dress, the exchange of opinions was solely between Yvonne and Ulrich. It couldn’t be helped, since Lisbell had been confined to the bedroom and had no knowledge about the venue, the flowers, decorations, or anything else related to the wedding.

Yvonne also seemed to have received some kind of hint, as she directed most of her questions toward Ulrich. At first, Lisbell had been uncertain, but when Yvonne glanced at her neck in the mirror—specifically the bandaged area from her burn—it became clear to her what was going on.

Of course, they didn’t completely disregard the doctor. Whenever Lisbell seemed to lose herself mentally, Ulrich would pull her back into reality by gently starting a conversation.

“What do you think, Lisbell?”

“…I like it.”

“Which one?”

“The one I’m wearing right now.”

“You said you liked the one you tried on earlier.”

“They’re all so beautiful, I can’t choose.”

Through the large full-length mirror, Lisbell occasionally met Ulrich’s gaze. Every time their eyes met, he would pause, holding his glass to his lips, and flash a small, almost amused smile.

Can you really endure this?

Can you really stand here, choosing a dress to walk down the aisle with me?

You want to feel comfortable, don’t you? That’s a lie, isn’t it?

This is all just an act, isn’t it?

Come on, show your true self.

Go back to when you were screaming that you hated me, that you were disgusted.

Expose all the hidden thoughts you’ve been keeping inside.

The beautiful and grotesque pale blue gaze directed at her seemed to pour out such temptations. Lisbell deliberately did not avoid his eyes and steadfastly put on the dress. The subtle applique decorations on the dress swirled around the hem, making it look like a living flower.

Ulrich behind her let out a low exhale.

“Hmm… Madam?”

Yvonne, who had been carefully unrolling the train of the dress, turned toward him. Ulrich, sitting with his legs crossed, leisurely swirled his glass while offering an awkward smile.

“I’m afraid it’s going to be difficult for me to step out for a moment.”

“Do you have an urgent matter?”

“Well, it’s somewhat urgent…”

His hand, not holding the glass, reached down to rest on his knee and gently stroked it. There was something strangely intimate about the touch. Yvonne, who had been watching, quickly realized his intentions. Once she understood, it seemed rather blunt.

“Oh, my.”

She, a seasoned professional, seemed flustered for the first time in such a situation. Her smile, which had been unshaken despite Lisbell’s indifferent attitude, wavered for the first time.

“It seems you really like this dress.”

“Seems so, since I want to be alone with her right now.”

The smoothness of his voice contrasted with the shocking content of the conversation, leaving Yvonne at a loss as to how to respond.

Knock.

There was a knock on the door.

The door opened, and Viktor appeared.

“Sorry to interrupt. Sir, there’s something urgent…?”

Viktor, with no intention of further conversation, immediately approached Ulrich.

Ulrich, seemingly disappointed, took a sip of his drink and set the glass down before standing up. As expected, his pants bulged awkwardly. Despite that, his face remained remarkably calm.

Approaching the door, Ulrich briefly listened to Viktor’s message, then turned to look at Yvonne.

“Looks like I need to step out for a moment. I’ll be back soon, so please take care of things in the meantime, Madam.”

“Yes, don’t worry.”

Ulrich left with Viktor, and the situation came to a close. Just the absence of the man’s gaze made Lisbell feel a lot more at ease.

Unlike earlier, when she could hardly breathe, she was able to relax a little now.

Yvonne began explaining the dresses that Lisbell hadn’t yet tried on, showing them one by one. Lisbell half-listened, her attention wandering around the room. She was cautious not to let on that she was wondering whether Yvonne had received some kind of hint. Fortunately, Yvonne seemed to remain focused on the clothing.

As Yvonne was organizing the back of the dress that Lisbell had just tried on, she let out a short exclamation.

“Oh dear, I completely forgot about the veil.”

“The veil?”

“Yes. A wedding dress isn’t complete without considering the veil. I’ll go get it right now, so would you mind waiting just a moment?”

“Ah… yes.”

If she could leave the room too, it would be a welcome relief for Lisbell. Yvonne asked for permission and hurriedly opened the door and left.

Now alone, Lisbell, in her stunning dress, began to inspect every corner of the reception room. Not stopping there, she also looked over the rack she had just stood near and the tools that Yvonne had been busy handling. She was searching for things like pins attached to the clothes or scissors used by the madams to cut threads. But none of it satisfied her. They were all less than worthless—mere shattered pieces of glass.

‘No… something else…’

Just as her thoughts were starting to deepen, a sudden silence disturbed her.

Only moments ago, there had been the soft rustle of fabric, laughter, and the hum of voices filling the space. Now, it was as if the room had been washed clean by water, leaving an eerie quiet.

When she realized what had happened, she understood.

She was the only one left in the reception room.

At that moment, the injury to one of her ankles had fully healed, and the shackles that had bound her other ankle were removed.



Her violet eyes, which had been dim under dark clouds like violets in the shade, suddenly surged, trembling. Her gaze, carrying the tremors of her inner turmoil, slowly turned toward the door.

The door was closed.

But it could be opened.

She was no longer in the state where she couldn’t walk alone, and she wasn’t physically held back by shackles either. Both the man and the madam who had been attending to her were gone.

Recalling the days when she had freely roamed the mansion, the hallways were always quiet. Few people passed by, and there were plenty of hiding places.

So if she was careful…

‘Escape…’

Could she do it?

The realization struck her mind like a collision, and every cell in her body screamed in excitement.

Run. Escape. Get away. Go far.

The rejection that soaked her chest was raw and vivid. Her thoughts, trying to roll forward smoothly, were blocked. She just wanted to take the opportunity to distance herself from Ulrich, to find a way to get away from him. She longed to drink in that desire to the point of intoxication.

From that man’s side…

Once more…

Her two feet, covered in the white dress, moved toward the door. The tension she had barely suppressed shot up again, and her lower abdomen chilled.

When she grasped the doorknob, a flash of pale blue light suddenly shone in her mind. In the darkness, in the light, under the ceiling, those arrogant eyes had been looking down at her.

Lisbell opened the door with a sudden motion.

“….”

The regret came instantaneously.

What if this was some kind of trap set by him? What if he had someone stationed outside the door, watching to see how she would react? What if he had planned to watch her and see what she would do next? How could she have been so reckless?

Before she even realized it, her breath had become ragged. Lisbell, barely able to make a sound that no one else could hear, turned her stiff neck from side to side.

No one… was there.

There was no sign of anyone waiting to watch her leave. No matter how long she waited, she couldn’t hear a single sound. It was just eerily quiet, like a scene from everyday life, so much so that it felt strange.

A shiver ran down her spine. Lisbell, gripping the hem of her dress, took a deep breath. She could see the long hallway ahead. If she ran down there, descended the stairs, and turned right… she would be at the entrance of the mansion. Once she passed through there, she would be out of the mansion for good. She would leave behind the shackles that had gripped her ankles like a snake, the wedding dress that had been meant to make her a bride of hell.

The doorframe, which had been drawn as a line in the sand, loomed ahead.

Just one step.

One step, and freedom would be hers.

 Ulrich’s hand moved smoothly over the documents.

After completing yet another review and corresponding signature, Victor, who had been standing before him, occasionally glancing at his watch, quietly informed him,

“It’s been an hour since Madam left.”

The hand that had been moving without hesitation suddenly stopped. The sharp nib paused mid-stroke, causing ink to pool and form a large blot.

Ulrich slowly lifted the fountain pen. He lightly tapped the round ink blot with the nib before setting the pen down and rising leisurely from his chair. When he was told thirty minutes had passed earlier, he hadn’t reacted, but apparently, an hour was his limit.

Taking out a cigarette, he placed it between his lips. Victor immediately stepped forward to light it for him. Exhaling a stream of smoke, Ulrich moved toward the door and asked,

“What do you think, Victor?”

“…Pardon? What do I think?”

“What do you think happened?”

It was clear what his superior was implying.

As if he took some perverse pleasure in observing Lisbell Osborne’s response to the predicament he had orchestrated—a kind of sadistic curiosity.

“…I’m not sure.”

No more, no less—that was his honest answer.

I really don’t know.

Considering everything she’d endured, one might assume she had learned her lesson. But recalling her desperate pleas to see Madam, she didn’t seem like someone who would break so easily. Yet, if she had fled again, it would just be history repeating itself.

“What I mean is… I don’t think it matters.”

What state of mind had he been in when he said that?

Victor felt not only the exhaustion of dealing with whatever situation Lisbell might create but also the simple discomfort of having to witness it all up close.

Having served Ulrich for many years, he knew his master’s temperament well. He was stubborn and self-reliant. The more someone resisted him, the more inevitable it became that they would be overwhelmed.

For that reason, Victor’s feelings toward Lisbell were akin to watching glass charge toward a collision, knowing it would shatter into pieces. It made him anxious just observing it unfold. That was why he had urged her to give up—because persuading Ulrich was out of the question.

“Do you really need to go this far?”

Fortunately, Lisbell seemed to have heeded his advice, judging by how the two of them had been getting along these past few days.

Despite pretending otherwise, Ulrich was someone whose moods were quite transparent—at least to someone like Victor, who had served him for so long. And for days now, he had been calm. What did that signify? It meant that the conflict with Lisbell, who had sought refuge in religion to escape him, had significantly eased.

Just the other day, he had unshackled her ankle, even taking her into his arms and leading her around the study at a leisurely pace. Bathed in the multicolored light streaming through the windows, the two had looked almost like an intimate couple. That was the peace created by Lisbell’s surrender.

It would have been nice if things ended there. But this madman had devised yet another scheme to test her true feelings. Under the guise of work, he had first excused himself and then had Madam leave after a suitable delay.

Naturally, this left Lisbell alone in the reception room.

A cunning strategy, designed solely to see how she would react to the taste of freedom—it was nothing short of malicious.

“These days, she’s been doing something cute.”

“…Excuse me? What has she been doing?”

“She says she wants to be comfortable now.”



“She doesn’t want to suffer anymore, so she’s going to accept me.”

Following Ulrich as he strode toward the reception room, Victor quietly swallowed. He had wondered if there had been a sudden shift in their relationship, but it turned out she had been the first to say something like that.

Ulrich, walking ahead, suddenly chuckled.

“Isn’t it adorable?”



“It’s obvious she’s playing me, isn’t it?”

Victor unconsciously clenched his fists.

Ulrich had been in a good mood these past few days, no doubt about it. He was even reconsidering a terrible investment proposal he had previously dismissed and had called in a lawyer for legal advice. Until now, Victor had assumed it was all thanks to Lisbell’s sweet words. But had Ulrich been harboring suspicions all along?

“The problem is me.”



“I keep wanting to be fooled.”

His tone carried a hint of self-mockery.

“I keep wanting to fall for it… That’s the problem.”

With doubt so deeply embedded in his mind, trust seemed unattainable, no matter how Lisbell Osborne acted. Victor swallowed the words that threatened to surface.

By then, their brisk steps had come to a halt in front of the reception room.

The door was closed.

Just as it had been when he left.



With the cigarette still between his lips, Ulrich stared down at the doorknob.

He recalled the quiet eyes that had watched him as he unshackled her ankle that morning.

Cute and detestable eyes.

At some point, her gaze had become paradoxical to him. Softer than before, yet somehow, that very gentleness only sparked an ominous sense of foreboding. Sometimes, he wanted to grab her by the throat, squeeze tightly, and demand to know if she was sincere—if she truly intended to stay by his side.

In the past, he would have done just that.

But now, with her acting this way, he couldn’t bring himself to do it. Perhaps because he couldn’t discard the ridiculous glimmer of hope that her determination wasn’t just a shallow ploy but something real.

If that was the case, one wrong move could shatter the delicate sandcastle she had painstakingly built through all her trials.

…Yes, the truth was, he was already more than halfway convinced.

Half? No, perhaps it wasn’t an exaggeration to say he had already lost his composure entirely.

Feeling disgusted with his own foolishness, Ulrich shook his head slightly and gripped the doorknob. Exhaling the smoke lingering under his tongue, he pushed the door open. It swung smoothly without a sound.



The room was quiet. So silent, it seemed no one was there.

A tense vein bulged in Ulrich’s mind. He removed the cigarette from his lips and stubbed it out against the door frame.

Even though he had expected it, the disappointment that settled into his bones was profound.

Of course, she wouldn’t stay.

Looking back, it was absurd to think he could trust a few flattering words. Why had he unlocked the shackle, left her alone, and walked away?

Why did I do that?

I must have been completely out of my mind.

Where did she run off to this time? Did she even have anywhere left to go? He had already torn apart everything—her fiancé, her mother, even the religion she had sought refuge in—so where else could she possibly turn?

Well… where should I start looking? She was probably still within the townhouse. Should he have Victor block off the station first? No matter what, when he brought her back this time, he would—

Just then, a small sound reached his ears.

“…Ouch.”

It came from behind a large clothing rack, about as tall as he was.

Ulrich, who had been standing still with only his fingertips twitching, suddenly snapped out of his daze and strode forward.

Rounding the clothing rack, he spotted a small figure nestled among the dazzlingly colorful dresses. Soft gray hair swayed with her slight movements.

“…Lisbell.”

She was right there.

He had no idea what she was doing, crouched down, staring at her hand as if she had hurt her finger. Only when he called her name did she finally notice his presence.

Calmly, she lifted her head. Her violet eyes turned toward him, creating a surreal feeling—as if he were seeing an illusion.

“…Pfft.”

Ulrich let out a laugh.

Only when the sound of air popping like bubbles reached his ears did he realize—he was the one laughing.


Precisely…

 

Lisbell’s gaze reached the face of the man pressing close to her cheek.

 

Her freedom was in the hands of this man.

 

As long as this man treated her like a toy in his hand, simply distancing herself physically was not the solution. No matter how much she ran away, became disillusioned, struggled, or despaired, unless she destroyed the root of oppression named Ulrich Altahart, it would be an endless cycle.

 

That’s why she didn’t run away.

 

There was no longer any use in curling up and raising the white flag.

 

“If you want to win, you have to be bold.”

 

Did he know?

 

What kind of feelings the person giving him that advice truly held.

 

He probably didn’t know.

 

That’s why, from that day on, he didn’t shackle Lisbell’s ankles.

 



 

Clang, clang.

 

Unlike the sofa in Ulrich’s bedroom, the velvet sofa in the reception room with its arched legs shook noisily with the slightest movement.

 

Thud, thud! Lisbell’s waist twisted uncontrollably, unable to withstand the force pushing up from below. Each time, the man’s hands, sculpted like stone, grabbed her hips and thrust more deeply into her groin.

 

“Mm, mm… Ah… Ahh…!”

 

Their lower bodies, locked together, became wet. The column-shaped hole was already covered in a foamy haze from the relentless piston thrusts.

 

Each time the thick manhood slid along the slick, sensitive path, Lisbell’s calves trembled lightly as they pointed towards the sky.

 

Like a stallion lost in the taste of lust, Ulrich was busy rocking his hips. Each time, he grasped her ankles again and planted a soft kiss near her ankle bone.

 

The eerie sensation of a shackle often lingered there, making the man’s bird-like kiss unbearably unsettling. Even while her body rocked, a subtle chill didn’t leave her.

 

“Ah, here… It’s incredibly soft.”

 

As he thrust up into her connected depths, the line of his back, tightly clad in a shirt and vest, displayed a sinful rhythm. The morning sunlight shone in a way that couldn’t hide it.

 

“Lisbell, because you’re relaxing… Ha, it goes in even deeper than usual. Can you feel it? Here, mm…”

 

As if he wanted her to feel it, he pushed his pulsing organ deep into the tight inner flesh. The swelling sensation spread as if her cervix was being pierced. It was so full that it made her dizzy.

 

As the rounded head pushed up like a greeting, a flickering tremor spread across her vision. Lisbell’s lower abdomen involuntarily tightened, and her half-closed eyelids quivered deeply.

 

Ulrich, who chuckled at her receptive response, lazily shook his rod, buried deep in her hole.

 

Though his thrusts weren’t strong, the vivid sensation of his glans rubbing against her inner walls left Lisbell’s lips parted. Ulrich eagerly leaned forward and thrust his stiff tongue into her open mouth.

 

“Mm, mm… Mm! Huh, ah, ahh!”

 

As their bodies tangled, the sofa began to groan sorrowfully again.

 

Ulrich carelessly rolled up the dress he had personally chosen for her. The intense stimulation made him want to tear apart everything his hands could reach.

 

The intense surge of excitement was expressed through his thrusting. Thud, thud! He struck her wide-open perineum, spreading and widening her tight entrance.

 

The slick, foamy connection emitted obscene sounds that echoed throughout the reception room. The air grew hot with the steamy atmosphere of their erotic encounter.

 

Knock, knock.

 

A knock suddenly interrupted.

 

“Master, it’s time for you to leave.”

 

Victor’s voice faintly came from outside.

 

Lisbell flinched momentarily, but Ulrich, lost in the heat of the moment, was engrossed in exploring her as if he were deaf to all other sounds. Even if a bomb dropped right in front of him, he seemed ready to bury himself in her flesh and lose himself in lust.

 

“Ha, mm, outside… Mm… Ahh…!”

 

“Mm…?”

 

“Outside, there are people, mm, mm, ugh…!”

 

“It’s okay, ha, you don’t need to, care.”

 

It was clear that he didn’t want her to care about anything except him.

 

As Lisbell, spread wide open, was pressed deeper into the sofa, Ulrich swallowed his ragged breath and increased his pace.

 

His thrusts grew rougher as the flesh inside her pushed against her vaginal walls, reaching the brink. Her entire body contracted, unable to breathe, and Ulrich’s breath melted out in response.

 

“Did it go deep, mm?”

 

“Mm, mm…!”

 

“It’s squeezing so tight. Mm? What should I do? If it’s like this, I won’t want to leave….”

 

He chuckled and lifted Lisbell’s skirt. Grasping her plump buttocks, he spread her wide open to reveal her perineum. Then, he shot forward and thrust his manhood deep inside.

 

“Mm, ahh, ng, ha…!”

 

As the rough surface of his veined manhood scraped her tender entrance, Lisbell gulped down her breath.

 

She reached out and caressed Ulrich’s body. Slipping her hand through the open neckline of his shirt, exposed by the loosened tie, she touched his skin. A raspy, hoarse sound escaped Ulrich’s mouth. The organ buried inside her shivered in sync with its owner, swelling with arousal.

 

Ulrich could never resist when Lisbell touched him of her own will. His jaw muscles clenched violently as he hugged her thigh and roughly thrust up.

 

Though his size was formidable, the lubricating effect of her juices and foam allowed her inner walls to soften enough to embrace him. With each piston thrust of his hardened manhood, the pleasure quickly escalated.

 

“Master,” came Victor’s voice again from outside, urging him to leave.

 

Ulrich gripped Lisbell’s lips, kissing them forcefully as he intensified his pace. His neat attire became disheveled, but he continued his thrusts with no regard for his appearance.

 

“Ah, ha…!”

 

“Mm, hoo.”

 

His intense yet controlled movements were frighteningly persistent. Finally, Lisbell’s insides reached their limit, and she squeezed her entrance tightly around him. Ulrich, his base swallowed up, couldn’t resist the suction of her inner walls and climaxed.

 

“Mm, mm…”

 

“Ha…”

 

As the two tangled together, their intertwined bodies let out a shared sigh of release.

 

Regaining his composure, Ulrich, still caressing Lisbell’s buttocks, continued his idle hand-play.

 

Lisbell, who was catching her breath, her hand still tracing his neck, met his eyes. Ulrich smiled seductively, like a red rose.

 

“Today, I’ll be back after just a simple dinner gathering….”

 

Thump!

 

The sound of someone impatiently banging on the door was heard then.

 

Ulrich, who had been busy groping her body even as he climaxed, finally withdrew his hand reluctantly. His low, smooth voice, tinged with irritation, softly called out, “Victor Loisden….”

 

Lisbell, lying there with a dazed expression, looked up at him.

 

Perhaps he was pleased with her submissiveness, beyond compliance, to the point of being as docile as a lamb. Ulrich, who had lowered her skirt himself, rolled it up again and spread her legs.

 

He kissed her entrance, soaked with his mark, and said, “I’ll be back.” If anyone saw, they would be shocked by such a shameless act, yet he committed it with a nonchalant expression as he stood up.

 

Soon after, the sound of the door opening and closing echoed.

 

Lisbell, trying to steady her breath even after Ulrich had left, closed her eyes tightly.

 

Her hand fell and grazed between her legs. She lifted it to her eyes. Her index, middle, and ring fingers were covered in his white semen that had spilled out as he withdrew.


Lisbell rubbed her palms against the sofa seat as if she had just come into contact with something vile. Her movements grew increasingly erratic, almost convulsive, as though she were in the throes of a severe fit.

Then, abruptly, her limbs went limp. The hand that had been obsessively scrubbing at the fabric lifted to cover her eyes.

Blocking out her vision and plunging herself into darkness, she finally managed to steady her breath. Yet, no matter how desperately she tried, the lingering sensation of semen on her fingertips refused to fade, tormenting her with every passing second.

The trace of a man left within her body.

The weight of what that meant.

The inevitable, horrifying consequence twisted her thoughts into chaos.

‘No….’

She couldn’t even fully form the thought—not even in fragments. The mere idea of carrying his child was so grotesque, so repulsive, that her mind recoiled from it. But more than anything, what terrified her most was the possibility that it could become reality.

‘I have to do something….’

I must.

If this continues, my child will—

Thankfully, she had been granted some degree of freedom within the mansion. Ever since the wedding dress fitting, Ulrich had stopped imposing restrictions on her movements, even when she returned to the bedroom. That was how she had managed to slip away today, retreating to the drawing room unnoticed.

Of course, he was still keeping an eye on her.

He was the kind of man who could feign warmth while plotting something sinister in the shadows. Lisbell knew she had to remain vigilant, pretending to accept her circumstances as if she had lost all hope of escape. As if there was nothing left for him to break—not even a fragment.

Enduring his touch and not resisting the traces he left on her body was part of the game she was playing. If she truly wanted to destroy him, she had to be willing to lose herself in the process. Without that level of resolve, she wouldn’t even be able to leave a scratch.

But still.

The feeling of lying there, his presence clinging to her skin—

She forced herself to swallow down the dark emotions rising within her. Pushing off the sofa, she steadied herself.

‘Should I look for the medicine? Didn’t they put something like that in my food before? But where? The kitchen? Or is there a separate storage room? What if Ulrich hears of it? What if he grows suspicious? I haven’t even found the right tools yet—what if he puts the shackles on me again…?’

She sat there in a daze, slowly fastening the buttons of her dress, which had loosened to reveal her skin.

“…Please, madam! The master has ordered that no one be allowed in here for the time being….”

A commotion erupted outside the closed door. Lisbell turned her head just as the door suddenly swung open. The intrusion was forceful, as though someone had insisted on entering despite the servant’s protests.

“Who is inside that I am forbidden from seeing?”

The voice belonged to none other than Mrs. Altahart.

She halted upon seeing Lisbell seated on the sofa.

This was the first time Lisbell had encountered her since arriving at the mansion. Despite wandering the estate for days, she had never once crossed paths with the woman, leading her to assume she had been staying elsewhere. Apparently, that wasn’t the case.

Behind the lady stood a flustered servant, his unease palpable. Clearly, Ulrich had issued an order barring anyone from entering this room—something Lisbell had been unaware of until now.

Seeing the servant hesitate, uncertain of what to do, Lisbell gave him a small nod. Understanding the silent command, he quickly bowed, shut the door, and disappeared.

Mrs. Altahart let out a derisive laugh.

“I wondered why I was being kept out, and it turns out… you were in here.”

Her refined voice, as polished as a classical performance, was laced with invisible thorns.

“If anyone saw this, they might mistake you for the mistress of this house, Miss Osborne.”

The way she spoke left no room for doubt—this was not a misunderstanding.

Of course, she must have been utterly baffled. After all, she had once extended a helping hand, only for Lisbell to flee on her own, only to end up back here—captured and dragged into the mansion again.

Mrs. Altahart crossed the room, settling on the opposite sofa. Meanwhile, Lisbell quietly continued fastening the buttons of her dress, saying nothing.

The lady’s cold gaze swept over Lisbell’s body, still marked by the remnants of intercourse. Her blue irises darkened with disdain, like vines creeping over an icy lake. It was the look of someone staring at a leech, one that was draining her precious son’s wealth and power.

Under her scrutiny, Lisbell finished buttoning her dress to the very top. She appeared calm, lost in thought, but her silence seemed to infuriate Mrs. Altahart further.

“Have you had a change of heart?”



“Well, I suppose the position of mistress in this house must be quite appealing for someone of your station.”



“I thought at least some of the courage and defiance you displayed when demanding your mother’s funeral would remain, but it seems I overestimated you. Then again, with such a frail constitution, it’s no wonder you let things reach this point.”

It was clear she believed Lisbell had chosen to stay by Ulrich’s side of her own free will. After all, she was now part of the family, and no doubt, the lady had heard whispers of the wedding Ulrich was preparing alone—without consulting anyone.

“Madam, do I look happy to you?”

After a long silence, Lisbell finally spoke.

Mrs. Altahart’s lips parted as if to respond, but the words stalled.

Her icy blue eyes took in Lisbell once more—her gaunt frame, the bandages still wrapped around her neck, the unmistakable frailty that even Ulrich’s expensive clothes could not conceal. It was a wound wealth could not heal, a scar too deep to be hidden.

“Do I look like I’m doing this by choice?”



“No, I’ve given up.”

Mrs. Altahart’s expression flickered, ever so slightly. Lisbell continued, her voice composed.

“Have you ever felt molten wax drip onto your skin, burning you?”



“Have you ever had your ankle snapped beneath someone’s hand?”



“Do you know what it’s like to live in constant fear, only to have the safe haven you finally found ripped away from you?”



“Madam, I’m exhausted by the pain.”



“So I’ve simply given up.”

Her voice was smooth, as if reciting a decision long since made.

There was a time when she had begged Ulrich’s secretary.

‘Please, bring the madam to me. Let me meet her, or at least send her my words….’

But the response had been unchanging.

‘He is no longer just the young master—he is the head of this family. Even the madam can no longer stop him.’

Even Mrs. Altahart could no longer be her shield. If anything, she was now in greater danger. And judging by her bitter attitude, she knew it.

Mrs. Altahart was not overtly hostile, but she was hardly an ally. She was someone who prioritized the family above all else.

Even so, Lisbell saw an opportunity.

“I don’t want to be here—I’m only enduring this, waiting for your son to grow bored of me. As I said, I’ve stopped fighting back because I can’t bear the suffering anymore.”



“But… I don’t want to have Ulrich’s child.”

For the first time, Mrs. Altahart’s composed expression wavered.

“When Ulrich is done with me, I want to leave without any ties. And in this matter, I believe our interests align, madam.”

“…You’re asking me for medicine?”

“If you don’t want the noble bloodline of your family to be tainted.”

Even as she spoke, the words felt wretched—describing her own blood as unworthy. But it was a thousand times better than allowing that nightmare to come true. She would rather scar herself than bear his child.
