Sweat trickled down her upturned chin. Her chest, pressed against the man’s, rubbed against his skin. Ulrich, who had been thrusting into her with relentless force, withdrew at the last moment and rubbed his flesh against her spread thighs.

 

With a heavy breath, Ulrich found Lisbell’s lips and kissed her deeply, intertwining their tongues as he continued to move against her soft thighs. The thick fluid spilled from the tip of his throbbing cock.

 

“Uh…”

 

Lisbell’s platinum hair rustled down. Her slip had long since been discarded, leaving her loosely wrapped in a robe that barely covered her heaving breasts.

 

The sensual waves in the darkness continued as her body writhed. It was impossible to stop, driven by the man’s tongue licking her entrance directly.

 

Ulrich enjoyed the tightness of her trembling walls, reaching deep inside her with his tongue after bringing her to climax.

 

Her soft inner walls squeezed the warm flesh of his tongue, sucking it in hungrily. Every time he swirled his tongue inside her, wet sounds filled the room. He didn’t mind the increasing moisture, swallowing it down his throat.

 

“Ugh… uh.”

 

Lisbell covered her mouth with the back of her hand. Her ragged breaths came out in rapid succession. She didn’t want to react, but her body, already surrendered to pleasure, writhed beneath him in joy.

 

Ulrich, who was fervently licking her below, finally raised his head when his face was drenched. His red tongue slid out of her, gleaming in the dim light, dripping with her fluids, enhancing his provocative image.

 

He licked his lips and inserted two fingers into her mouth.

 

“Ugh…”

 

“You forgot to release your excitement here.”

 



 

“Should I spit?”

 

Lisbell’s face twisted slightly. Reading her discomfort, Ulrich smirked and swirled his fingers inside her mouth, pushing them so deep that she gagged before he pulled them out, now coated in her saliva.

 

Turning on her side, Lisbell blinked at the clock. It was close to two in the morning.

 

A time that no longer felt unexpected.

 

Busy with succession work, Ulrich often returned to the mansion at such late hours and frequently woke Lisbell, already asleep, with his impromptu sexual advances.


When the heavy heat in her belly and the chilling tension in her body woke her up, Ulrich’s weight was pressing down on her again.

 

Ulrich would strip her as he pleased, thrust as he wished, and continue until he was satisfied. As a result, Lisbell felt completely drained. Trapped in this mansion, her only activity was sex with him, and even that left her exhausted for the entire day.

 

There was also a deep sense of self-loathing. Reflecting on her past, she couldn’t shake the feeling of being a tool for a man’s sexual desires.

 

A chilling voice echoed in her mind, urging her not to think further. Lisbell buried her face deeply into the pillow, not wanting to feel more pain.

 

Ulrich, downing a glass of whiskey, removed the blanket as he went to wash up. The sound of running water from the bathroom tempted her to continue her disturbed sleep, but surprisingly, her mind was clear. Only her body felt heavy and sore.

 



 

Lisbell rubbed her cheek against the pillow and brought her clenched hand in front of her eyes.

 

She recalled the platinum hair that had lightly brushed against her hand. Hair that resembled Ulrich’s but left a vastly different impression.

 

As she idly recalled this, Ulrich returned from his shower. Still with work to do, he sat at a desk lit by a lamp, reviewing documents. Listening to the rustling papers, Lisbell cautiously spoke up.

 

“There was a child in the mansion.”

 

Ulrich, who had been turning a page with an unlit cigarette in his mouth, looked at her.

 

“Did you meet them?”

 

Did she meet them? It was hard to say. After she had helped the child in distress, the child had followed her around, but she didn’t feel the need to mention it in detail. Facing Ulrich’s sharp gaze, she felt she shouldn’t.

 

“Where?”

 

“I saw them while passing through the corridor… by chance.”

 

“Did you greet them?”

 

“No. If it’s a sensitive matter, you can pretend you didn’t hear it.”

 

“It’s not that sensitive.”

 

“…Who are they?”

 

“Gwen’s illegitimate child.”

 

She had suspected it. Just by their hair color, she could guess they were related to the family.

 

Also, Julian’s behavior made more sense now. From their previous conversation, she had gathered he was Mrs. Altahart’s lover… or something similar. Was it okay for someone like him to treat a family member so poorly? Perhaps he took advantage of the child’s ambiguous status as an illegitimate child.

 

“Is the child only in this mansion?”

 

“Yes.”

 

“Why?”

 

“I just explained why.”

 



 

“Because they are illegitimate.”

 

“Then what about their education…?”

 

“Well, that’s a matter for the future.”

 

“A matter for the future?”

 

“It means it’s too early to decide their fate. Just because they’re Gwen’s child doesn’t mean they can be formally recognized due to their mother’s poor lineage.”

 

“…Then why bring them here?”

 

“Just in case. Even if they’re only half-related, there might be a need to accept them as a family member depending on the situation. Especially since my mother is very thorough in these matters.”

 



 

“Leaving them out of sight and later having them come back with a claim to the family based on blood relations would be troublesome. It’s better to keep an eye on them from the start.”

 

In other words, because they were an illegitimate child, they were left without proper education. If legitimate heirs couldn’t take their place for some reason, the child would be a backup.

 

Considering the family’s honor and authority, it made sense. However, it was sad and bitter that the child, so small that their head barely reached her waist, lived in this vast mansion without proper care.

 

The child had definitely craved affection. They must have never received such attention, which is why they followed her around so eagerly. The more she thought about it, the more it bothered her.

 

“…I was just wondering, but.”

 

Stop.

 

She had to stop this unnecessary meddling here.

 

What right did she have to take care of someone else in her situation? She had no room for such leisure.

 

But her mouth wouldn’t stop.

 

“Would it be difficult for me to take care of the child?”

 

“Huh?”

 

Lisbell hesitated as she sat up. The warmth she felt from the child kept resurfacing, a feeling she thought she couldn’t experience in Altahart’s mansion.

 

“Even if it’s just basic education….”

 



 

“No matter the reason, leaving a child like that is… too pitiful.”

 

Her heart pounded. Her hands and feet felt cold. Her body, exposed due to the fallen blanket, didn’t cause this chill. It was the anxiety within her.

 

She thought it might be presumptuous. If Ulrich felt the same, it would be disastrous for her.

 

She looked up, tense.

 

Ulrich, staring at her with an unreadable expression, chuckled softly.

 

“You said your dream was to be a teacher… You must really like children, Lisbell.”

 



 

“Or is it a sign that you haven’t given up on your former fiancé?”

 

“Huh?” he tilted his head lazily.

 

Lisbell’s shoulders tensed.

 

The forgetfulness that the dire situation urged always came back because of him. Ulrich would sometimes bring up her past with Theodore. Even though she knew it was just a means to mock her, it was hard to stay indifferent.

 

Because it brought back everything from that day.

 

The misunderstanding that she had an affair with Ulrich, which had hurt Theodore’s feelings deeply.

 

The back of her neck itched again. It felt like dozens of insects were crawling up from her feet, gathering in one spot, twisting her nerves and giving her goosebumps. Feeling her neck growing cold, Lisbell clutched it.

 

Then, he spoke.

 

“It seems difficult. The child is under my mother’s jurisdiction.”

 

“…Can’t you persuade her?”

 

“Your assumption is wrong. I have no intention of persuading my mother in the first place.”

 



 

“No need for such useless efforts.”

 

Despite half expecting this, her heart sank. It felt like a footprint, as if someone had stepped on her heart. Disappointment welled up.

 

Ulrich turned away, as if that was the end of the conversation. While she was left in despair, he continued to review his documents as if nothing had happened.

 

Listening to the sound of pages turning, Lisbell turned her head. On the mantelpiece of Carrara marble was a neatly placed letter. It was the one she had written for the day before she fell asleep.

 

“…Then what about me?”

 

Her voice was dry and rough like a drifting sandstorm.

 

“What am I supposed to do?”

 

She lived each day feeling suffocated by helplessness. She couldn’t even meet her original target, her mother, and all she could do was write a daily letter, uncertain if it would ever be properly delivered.

 

Maybe she saw a reflection of herself in the neglected child. They were both in positions where they had to remain here, even though they were deemed useless for now.

 

That helplessness and loneliness.

 

The pitiful feelings she had to endure repeatedly.

 

“Are you telling me to do nothing? I’m a living person. I have a will and I breathe. So I can’t just do nothing. If that’s what you really want, you should have brought a corpse that can’t move.”

 



 

“Or do you want to make me like that?”

 



 

“Do you really… want me to wither and die?”

 

Ulrich turned to her again. His gaze, deeper than usual, erased his usual relaxed demeanor. Perhaps that’s why it felt so cold. That chilling gaze wandered over Lisbell’s tense face.

 

He clicked his tongue and stood up. His long legs quickly brought him to the bed, where he grabbed Lisbell’s chin and lifted it. She didn’t want to follow his arrogant gesture, but she couldn’t resist his strength.

 

“I find this side of Lisbell very annoying.”

 



 

“But also amusing….”

 



 

“I don’t know whether to find it cute or bothersome.”

 

Her neck itched terribly. Lisbell grabbed his wrist.


However, he couldn’t separate himself from me.

 

My mind went blank at the sight of the man’s gleaming eyes right in front of me. They were terrifying, as if one wrong step could lead to a cliff edge. Eyes that seemed to burrow into my mind and consume my brain whole. Lisbell held her breath in front of those piercing eyes.

 

“I don’t want to make you a corpse just yet, so let’s speak kindly to Mother.”

 

He slowly bent his upper body.

 

His sculpted lips gently brushed against Lisbell’s. Though it was a part of a warm human body, all Lisbell could feel was a cold, bleak chill. Despair and pessimism, which she had often felt, came alive vividly.

 

Not long after, their lips parted with a faint sound.

 

When the distance between them increased, his eyes returned to their previous weight. Ulrich, eyes filled with a rough playfulness, let out a short chuckle and kissed Lisbell’s pale cheek.

 

As he moved away, he muttered softly.

 

“Strangely, it feels like I lost this time.”

 



“Here it is.”

The concise butler bowed and then turned away. Watching the departing figure, Lisbell turned her head.

It was the door to a room she had never visited before.

 

It had been a week since she had reluctantly brought up the topic of the child. Today, she was finally going to meet the child officially. Ulrich had somehow succeeded in persuading his Mother.

 

Lisbell placed her hand on the door.

 

As she stayed still, everything around her became as quiet as a dead mouse. Aside from the departing butler, there were no other signs of life.

 

She sincerely wanted to care for the child.

 

To ignore the child that everyone had abandoned felt like abandoning herself. It was almost like an act of suicide.

 

If she had ignored the uncomfortable feeling that habitually squeezed her chest, her deepening blue depression would have only grown worse.

 

But that wasn’t the only reason.

 

The letter that had mysteriously disappeared from the mantelpiece this morning.

 

Lisbell realized that her range of activities had significantly shrunk since moving to the capital. She met no one, and her daily routine was monotonous. Everything was limited to the point where it could be easily defined.

 

This couldn’t go on.

 

Due to Ulrich’s busy schedule, her meetings with Mother were continuously postponed.

 

But she couldn’t let herself get used to it.

 

However, expanding her range of activities was frightening. She wondered if even this was part of Ulrich’s meticulous plan, given his ability to make her feel the value of her name.

 

He was currently Mother’s guardian, and she didn’t want to arouse any unnecessary suspicion. Offending him would not bring any beneficial results.

 

For now, she needed to go along with the situation.

 

She needed to be careful and expand her range without being noticed. The most plausible way to do that was to teach the child. It provided a reasonable excuse to move around the mansion and potentially gather information related to Mother.

 

Creak.

 

She gently pushed the door open.

 

The bedroom, with its neatly arranged furniture and fixtures, felt bleak despite its tidiness. It felt like a sterile, businesslike environment rather than a space maintained with affection. It was similar in structure to Ulrich’s bedroom, but slightly different in that aspect.

 

As she stepped inside with difficulty.

 

Crash!

 

The child, sitting at the table and having a late meal, dropped the fork. The child, thinking it was a servant, looked up and was visibly surprised to see her.

 

But that wasn’t what caught Lisbell’s attention. The child’s situation of having to eat in such a hidden place was very similar to hers.

 

The stiff child soon came to life. Without thinking about picking up the fork, the child got off the chair and hid behind the bedpost. The cautiousness was consistent.

 

Lisbell didn’t rush the child. She lowered her posture to match the child’s eye level, just as she had done in the hallway. She smiled slightly without taking her eyes off the child. The child, who was awkwardly trying to hide behind the thin post, blinked.

 

Lisbell waved her open hand side to side. At her greeting gesture, the child hesitated but eventually mimicked it. Seeing the small hand, Lisbell smiled even brighter.

 

Seeing the wary expression on the child’s face slightly relax, Lisbell gestured for the child to come closer. The child hesitated, moving tentatively, as if afraid of being watched.

 

Finally, the child was close enough for Lisbell to touch. Slowly, she reached out and patted the side of the child’s head. The child flinched but didn’t pull away.

 

“Hello.”

 



 

“What’s your name?”

 

The child shook their head again.

 

“Don’t want to tell me?”

 

“…No.”

 

“What?”

 

“Don’t… have one.”

 

Don’t have a name?

 

The confusion in her mind quickly turned to cold clarity. This too was a form of neglect. No matter how indifferent they were, how could no one give the child a name? A name was fundamental to a person’s identity. It was chosen with care for the hope that it would play a role in the person’s life.

 

In other words, the people in this mansion didn’t care enough to be inconvenienced by the lack of a name for the child.

 

It wasn’t just a materially different world. This place, at the top of the Altahart pyramid, was a space where even the basic humanity expected in people had dried up.

 

“I’m going to take care of you for a while. We’ll be seeing each other every day.”

 

At the unexpected news, the child’s eyes widened.

 

“But without a name, it will be very inconvenient for us. So… I’ll give you a name. Is that okay?”

 

The child hesitated before nodding cautiously.

 

Lisbell thought for a moment. She remembered the orphanage in Misley where she had once stayed. There had been a child who arrived without a name, much like this child. The headmaster had gone to the church and received several names from the pastor.

 

“How about Noah?”

 

One of the names that had been considered but ultimately not given came to mind. As she gently suggested it, the child’s eyes widened with excitement. The child then jumped into Lisbell’s arms, whispering softly, “I like it.”

 

Lisbell patted the child’s head.

 

The warmth she felt was almost pulsating. It was the first time since coming to this mansion that she forgot the itch in her neck.

 



 

Noah was kind and innocent. It seemed it was the first time he received someone’s attention, and although he often didn’t know how to respond, he showed genuine joy. The pure aspects of a child were incredibly endearing.

 

The lessons always took place in Noah’s bedroom.

 

Although Noah was five, he lacked basic education and knowledge. Currently, he was treated worse than dust in the household due to his illegitimate status, but there might come a time when he would need formal education.

 

If that happened, as a noble of high birth, he would likely be sent to a prestigious public school. While gathering books for teaching, Lisbell learned that Ulrich had also attended such a school, increasing the likelihood of this scenario.

 

The more she thought about it, the more she was appalled by the family’s coldness.

 

If that time came, uneducated Noah would struggle to keep up with the other children, causing him great confusion. Yet, judging by their attitude, the household seemed to expect Noah to endure such difficulties on his own.

 

“It’s too cruel.”

 

In that case, he might have been happier living with the mother he never knew. Lisbell realized that blood ties alone were not enough for happiness.

 

Carrying the materials for the lessons, she headed to Noah’s room.

 

“You’ve decided to take care of that child?”

 

The sudden voice startled her. It came from the top of the stairs she was about to descend.

 

Lisbell gathered the items in her arms and looked up at Julian, who was smiling at her. Since their last meeting, his smile had felt increasingly disconcerting.


“Madame’s consent came as quite a surprise.”

 

Step by step, like an actor continuing a play, Julian descended gracefully and stood in front of Lisbell.

 

“Madame rarely reverses a decision once made. So naturally, I thought convincing the second young master would be impossible.”

 

“…Do you have business with me?”

 

Julian shrugged at Lisbell’s tone, which could be perceived as curt by some.

 

“Business? Nothing grandiose. I just thought we might as well introduce ourselves since we ran into each other. After all, both you and I are the lovers of this household’s members.”

 

Lisbell’s fingers tightened around the book she was holding, turning white.

 

“I am not like that. Don’t compare me to you.”

 

“Really?”

 

Julian tilted his head in apparent surprise.

 

“From what I saw in the dining room before, that didn’t seem to be the case.”

 

He pointed to his neck with a strange smile.

 

“Completely covered in bite marks.”

 

The memory of that day flashed back. It wasn’t the first time she had been pointed out. Madame Altahart had also expressed disapproval with a glance at her neck as she left the dining room. Lisbell instinctively covered her neck, which had healed considerably since that day.

 

“We’ll be seeing each other often. It would be awkward just to nod every time, don’t you think? Knowing each other’s names wouldn’t hurt. So, what’s your name? I’m Julian. Julian Scott.”

 

“…Julian, I’m sorry, but I’m really not like that. I’m just here because of a weakness I couldn’t avoid.”

 

She hadn’t intended to converse with him at length, but the assumption that she was unmistakably Ulrich’s lover made her slightly indignant.

 

No matter how much she thought about it, their situations were clearly different. Just remembering the dining room was enough. She had looked like she was being dragged to the slaughterhouse, while Julian comfortably stayed by Madame’s side, dutifully serving her. Though likely for monetary compensation, Julian seemed to have willingly become her lover.

 

Not being in that position, Lisbell’s rebuttal was clumsy.

 

“Weakness? What weakness?”

 

As soon as she saw Julian’s reaction, Lisbell realized her mistake.

 

She bit her lip. Julian’s smile faded as he saw her obvious discomfort.

 

Soon after, he spoke as if in admiration.

 

“The second young master… caught your weakness? My goodness, the great Ulrich did such a senseless thing? A man even married women lined up to be with?”

 

She felt her stomach twist. Julian’s insinuation that Ulrich’s feelings were special for treating her differently from others made her nauseous.

 

“Is your business done? Then I’ll be going.”

 

“Oh, wait. Hold on.”

 

As she hurried to leave, Julian grabbed her arm. When Lisbell looked at him with displeasure, Julian raised both hands in a gesture of surrender.

 

“At least tell me your name before you go. I told you mine.”

 

Sighing, she realized he wouldn’t let go until she told him her name.

 

“Lisbell Osborne.”

 

“Lisbell, Lisbell Osborne.”

 

Julian repeated her name as if memorizing it, then smiled meaningfully.

 

“If you ever need my help, feel free to ask.”

 

“…You’re quite friendly for someone who’s practically a stranger.”

 

“Living under the same roof, we might have to rely on each other sometimes.”

 

Why should that be necessary?

 

Though she couldn’t agree with his logic, she didn’t argue. The more time she spent there, the stronger her desire to leave became.

 

Lisbell nodded curtly and turned away. Glancing back as she walked down the corridor, she saw Julian still watching her. Ignoring his wave, she turned her face forward.

 

As she headed to Noah’s room, she reflected on her conversation with Julian.

 

“Madame rarely reverses a decision once made. So naturally, I thought convincing the second young master would be impossible.”

 

In fact, Lisbell had also been surprised when she heard Madame had given her permission. It wasn’t beneficial for them in any way.

 

Whether due to harsh reality or cold intentions, it was clear they intended to neglect Noah. Keeping him under the family’s control, either for care or surveillance, and discarding him when he became useless was likely their plan. In that sense, they probably felt fulfilling their duty by just providing for Noah’s basic needs.

 

“Such a useless task.”

 

Even Ulrich had said so himself.

 

So it was puzzling. Why would Madame allow something that wasn’t beneficial to them? And how had Ulrich persuaded her?

 



 

Lisbell paused, looking out at the sunlit window.

 

Is there a reason to dwell on it?

 

Thinking too much would only give her a headache. Adapting to the given situation and finding a way to survive was the best she could do.

 

She was destined to leave this place someday. More interest or curiosity was a luxury. A herbivore wondering about a predator’s thoughts would only end up being devoured.

 

Letting go of her thoughts, Lisbell headed to Noah’s room.

 

Behind her footsteps, the sunlight shimmered indifferently.

 

At the same time, the sunlight pouring into the mansion equally illuminated a hotel in the city center.

 

Rubbing his eyes strained from a long meeting, Ulrich entered the tea room in the hotel lobby, adjusting his cufflinks.

 

“Mother?”

 

“She’s already arrived.”

 

Just as Victor reported, his mother was already in the tea room. However, she wasn’t alone. Ulrich’s steps halted.

 

As if reading his movements, Daphne, sitting next to his mother, turned her head while lifting her teacup. Her golden eyes lit up with delight upon seeing him.

 

“Ulrich, come here.”

 

Damn.

 

Realizing he had been deceived, Ulrich let out a small laugh. He wanted to leave immediately, but there were already eyes on him. Being the owner of this hotel and a man of renowned reputation, it wasn’t unusual for him to draw attention.

 

Unable to turn back, Ulrich eventually sat at their table.

 

“The meeting ran long, so I’m a bit late. If you were alone, I might have apologized, but since you have company, it seems unnecessary.”

 

“An apology would suffice, but why don’t you greet Miss Schwaben first?”

 

At his mother’s prompting, Ulrich finally looked at Daphne. Sitting primly like a noble lady, Daphne met his gaze. Ulrich nodded slightly with a formal smile.

 

“It’s been a while, Ulrich.”

 

“Indeed. I never imagined you would be spending time with my mother.”

 

“Surprised by my unannounced visit? Yesterday, Madame invited me to have tea with her, and I was delighted to come.”

 

“It seems so.”

 

Ulrich’s detached reply came with a polite smile as he ordered a coffee.

 

Something touched the back of his hand resting on the sofa armrest. Looking down, he saw Daphne’s delicate, white fingers. She was holding his hand.

 

“I’m sorry about Gwen.”

 

The intimate touch and sincere expression seemed calculated but quickly felt impulsive. Her touch felt subtly sticky.

 

By noble standards, it wasn’t polite. Touching someone without permission was unacceptable. But Daphne Schwaben was never one to think that deeply.

 

Ulrich smirked, finding her consistent.

 

“Are you sincere?”
