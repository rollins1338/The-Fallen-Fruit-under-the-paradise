Like a baby bird, she accepted the food, then glanced sideways. She had sensed sharp stares earlier, and sure enough, two guests at a distant table were whispering as they watched. Judging by their flushed expressions whenever they glanced at Ulrich, the scene must’ve looked blissful to them.

Was that how it looked to everyone?

Even in this wretched state, simply being next to a man carved from stone like him—did it really make her appear serene and beautiful?

“Ugh…”

Suddenly, a wave of nausea surged. Lisbell turned away and covered her mouth. A sharp clatter echoed as Ulrich set down the cutlery and came around the table, gently patting her back.

But his touch only made her sicker. She couldn’t believe this was the same hand that once strangled her, shattered her ankles. That duality was so repulsive, she felt like filth was being poured over her back.

“Wait here for a moment.”

When her condition didn’t quickly improve, Ulrich stroked the back of her head once and left the table. Curling in on herself, she panted for breath, then wiped her lips with the back of her hand and reached for the glass of water beside her.

Her nausea eased the moment he disappeared, confirming it had been his presence triggering it. It made sense. He was utterly revolting. The fact that her reshaped, repurposed self—molded to fit the Althahart frame—seemed “normal” just by standing next to him was so infuriating and absurd, she could weep blood.

“…Ha.”

Realizing she was sitting across from the very man who had caused it all made her let out a laugh—dry and empty. It didn’t last long, her energy already drained. Lisbell turned her hollow gaze toward the window.

Ah…

It was dazzling.

The light had been pouring in since earlier, thanks to the sunny seat they’d chosen.

She wished that light would shatter her into pieces. That the beams would bore tiny holes into her body until she faded away—smaller and smaller, like grains of sand, crumbling gently into oblivion, leaving nothing behind.

Then she wouldn’t have to sit here, fighting the urge to vomit. Wouldn’t be a spectacle for strangers. Wouldn’t have to choke down food she couldn’t even taste…



She knew it was a hopeless wish, yet still, it pained her. Lisbell bit the inside of her cheek hard and turned her head. Just in time to see Ulrich returning to the table. His previously hurried steps relaxed as he saw she had calmed, returning to his usual composed air.

Thud.

Something bumped into his leg.

A little girl, small enough that her head didn’t even reach his waist, had stumbled against him. She fell backward from the impact, and the teddy bear she held—adorned with a red ribbon around its neck—rolled to the floor at Ulrich’s feet.

The sudden obstacle brought him to a stop. After a moment, he knelt and gently helped the girl up. Then he picked up the fallen toy and handed it back to her with a kind smile that masked his true nature.

He even patted her head as she shyly murmured something in return—her voice barely audible.

Lisbell’s eyes were filled with that image—so vividly, so completely. And then, it twisted and twisted until it finally shattered with a crack. The nausea she had just managed to suppress seemed to surge back. Or perhaps it wasn’t nausea at all—perhaps it was something else. Something undefined was pounding in her chest as if trying to crush her heart.

Thump, thump.

Thump, thump.

Thump, thump.

He’s kind…

He smiled gently at the child.

So kind…

He picked up the stuffed toy that had fallen at his feet.

To a child—he did.

…Why?

Thump.

A strange reverberation.

Like something was scratching—or collapsing inside her.

Only now did she realize: it wasn’t her heartbeat. It was the sound of a seed, deeply planted in her core, sprouting into life—the seed of doubt.

Lisbell suddenly jumped to her feet. Ulrich turned toward her at the abrupt movement. She instinctively stepped back, like she wanted to evaporate from his steel-blue eyes that clung to her. Sensing something was off, Ulrich quickly approached the table.

“Lisbell.”

“Ah, I… I…”

“What’s wrong?”

“I… I’m leaving.”

“Lisbell?”

“I have to go… I’m leaving. I’m leaving. I’m leaving! Let go—let go of me! I have to go. I have to—hah—I have to!”

Lisbell violently shook off his grasp, pushing the chair back at random. Her legs gave out, and she fell to the floor, hitting the table and sending dishes crashing to the ground. Shouts of surprise came from all around.

As she tried to crawl away, Ulrich barely managed to hold her back. She thrashed like someone blinded, hitting and pushing against his chest and shoulders. Her screams were soaked with a wet, gasping sob.

“Let go! I have to go! I can’t stay here—I, I… Aagh! AAH!”

Out of her mind, Lisbell shoved her head under the table and screamed. Realizing something was seriously wrong, Ulrich turned his head. Victor, who had been waiting nearby during the meal, quickly came over and handed him a syringe he’d prepared just in case.

Ulrich rolled up her sleeve, found her inner arm, and inserted the needle. Lisbell, wailing and thrashing as if the world around her didn’t exist, began to quiet as her eyelids gradually sank. Not long after, they closed completely, and her limbs fell limp.

“I’ll take her upstairs. Clean this up.”

“Yes, young master.”

Leaving the chaotic mess to his secretary, Ulrich carried her back to the room.

The tranquilizer kept Lisbell asleep until deep into the dark night. When she finally opened her eyes, tears—she didn’t even know had gathered—slid silently down her cheeks. As she moved to wipe them away, a voice came through the darkness.

“Lisbell.”

Instead of replying, she coughed faintly. Ulrich, in a shirt and trousers, came over from the side table, where he had likely been working, and helped her sit up. Then he handed her a glass of water. As she sipped to ease her dry throat, he spoke again.

“You’re in the room.”



“Your condition suddenly got worse, so I gave you a sedative. Do you remember?”

“…Yes.”

She answered in a voice that barely came out. Ulrich took the empty glass from her and gave her a quick glance.

“How are you feeling now?”

His eyes searched her face for signs. But Lisbell didn’t respond. Instead, she looked at him quietly in the dim light.

Ulrich never asked questions. Not once, no matter when or how her breakdowns came, no matter how wild and irrational—he never asked why. Even as he rushed to administer tranquilizers before anyone else could react, he never once asked what had triggered her or what the reason was this time.

Until now, she hadn’t thought much of that silence. But suddenly, it stood out—so sharply, so unbearably—that she could no longer ignore it.

A chill spread through her, deep and cold.

“…The toy.”

“Hm?”

“That… from earlier.”

“What about it?”

“I want it.”



“The teddy bear…”

 Ulrich didn’t say anything—it must have been something he didn’t expect at all. Just for a moment, he ran a hand across his mouth, as if collecting his thoughts, then slowly spoke.

“The teddy bear… is it?”



“Alright. Got it.”

With that gentle response, he softly touched Lisbell’s forehead and cheek. It seemed like he was checking if she had a fever, likely thinking she was babbling nonsense under the influence of sudden heat. Lisbell didn’t bother to confirm or deny. Instead, she slowly lay back down.

“The teddy bear…”

Ulrich murmured to himself, clearly still surprised, then let out a small chuckle. His cool fingers tickled her bangs for a moment before retreating.

She had just woken up, and it didn’t seem likely she’d fall asleep again so easily—but once her eyes closed, drowsiness quickly took hold. She didn’t bother to question what was luring her back into sleep.

A few days later, several boxes were delivered to the hotel. While working in his office, Ulrich moved to another room at Victor’s call and gave a wry laugh at the mountain of boxes stacked before him.

“This many?”

“Since we didn’t specify the purpose to the department store, they sent a variety—gift sets, display pieces, collector’s items… all kinds.”

“Well, more options aren’t a bad thing. Open them one by one.”

Victor joined the staff already unpacking. One by one, the teddy bears, carefully wrapped to keep them clean, were taken out of the boxes. Ulrich looked at the parade of bears with a detached expression, then picked up one with a thin, long red ribbon tied into a bow at its neck—similar to the one held by the girl they had seen in the lounge.

“Let’s go with this one. Store the rest for now.”

“Yes, sir.”

Without much deliberation, Ulrich took the chosen bear and returned to the guest room. The moment he opened the door, a profound stillness washed over him. Without bothering to check the rest of the room, he headed straight to the bed. As expected, Lisbell was lying there, sound asleep.

He had planned to leave the teddy bear by her pillow as a surprise for when she woke—but maybe she was only lightly asleep. The moment she sensed someone nearby, Lisbell stirred under the blanket. As he waited quietly, she slowly opened her eyes.

“Did you sleep well?”

With a warm greeting, Ulrich held the teddy bear up in front of her face. Lisbell blinked slowly, staring blankly at the stuffed animal. Ulrich gently wobbled the bear side to side, just like one would with a child.

“A gift.”



“You said you wanted it, remember?”

Lisbell pulled her hand out from under the blanket and gripped the bear. It was a response, but an uncertain one. Her face showed no joy—so much so that it went beyond indifference and almost seemed like she’d been handed an unwanted burden.

Her hollow, violet eyes eventually turned slowly toward his face.

“Why are you looking at me like that?”



“You don’t like it?”

As he teased lightly, Lisbell stared at him for a long moment, then shook her head slowly. She fiddled with the bear’s thickly stitched black paw a few times, then, as if bored, suddenly pushed it away and buried herself under the blanket again.

Watching quietly, Ulrich tilted his head. He hadn’t expected an overjoyed reaction—but this wasn’t disappointment either. It was a vague, unreadable reaction that didn’t fit any label.

He was tempted to pull her up and demand an answer, but Lisbell had already dozed off again, letting out faint breaths. Feeling strangely unsatisfied, Ulrich gently brushed aside her hair and then stood up.

As he stepped out of the room, Victor, who had been waiting outside, approached.

“Did she like it?”

“Not sure…”

“Sir?”

Ulrich glanced back toward the room and said:

“Move everything that arrived today into the room.”

“All of it… sir?”

“All of it.”

Victor looked baffled but agreed. Afterward, Ulrich returned to his regular work with Victor assisting as usual. The sun that had lit the day gradually dipped lower, and dusk began to creep in like it meant to consume the world whole.

As Ulrich ascended the stairs to return to the room, he thought: by now, the guest room would be filled with teddy bears. What kind of reaction would Lisbell show at the childish display? It would surely be more expressive than that vague emptiness from before.

He imagined it as he climbed the stairs—one step at a time.

Ulrich’s steps suddenly came to a halt. The voice of Victor, who had been following behind and listing matters that needed Ulrich’s attention, also stopped mid-sentence.

Both men’s eyes fixated on the same spot.

In front of the closed guest room door, someone was anxiously shifting from foot to foot for some unknown reason. It was Lisbell’s personal attendant—assigned to assist her with meals, bathing, and other needs. There could only be one reason for someone like that to appear so nervous. Something had happened concerning Lisbell.

Victor, recovering faster than Ulrich, hurried ahead and grabbed the attendant to question him.

“What’s going on?”

“I… um… that is…”

“Is there a problem with Miss Osborne?”

“It’s not… anything major. Just…”

The attendant hesitated, clearly unsure how to phrase things.

A seizure, maybe? No—that couldn’t be it. If it were, someone would’ve already come running to report it. This wasn’t the first time something like that had happened. So what else could possibly make the attendant act like this?

Victor’s pondering led nowhere. Ulrich, who had followed them up the stairs, walked past them without a word and opened the guest room door.

The room was filled with a deep crimson glow of sunset. Inside, there were usually only two sounds: a sharp, piercing voice that seemed to torture her own eardrums, or faint breathing so subtle it was hard to catch unless one paid close attention—like from someone in a deathlike sleep.

But today, what Ulrich heard was an entirely unfamiliar sound.

Rip.

Something being torn apart.

Tear.

A sound like fabric being shredded.

Plop. Thud.

The sound of something bursting or dropping.

Those sounds overlapped occasionally, echoing faintly.

The room was soaked in sunset light so red it could’ve been a sea of blood. Perhaps that was why the sounds, usually easy to ignore, crawled their way insistently into Ulrich’s ears.

Then, something rolled to his feet.

He looked down quietly. It was a torn-off short arm, white stuffing bursting from the tear. It didn’t take long for him to realize—it was part of the teddy bear he had ordered brought into the room today.

Rip, rip.

The sound of fabric continued being torn. Ulrich slowly raised his head.

In the blazing red backdrop, he saw a figure slumped lifelessly on the floor. The stillness of her posture made her look like a corpse engulfed in flames.

Ulrich’s feet slowly moved toward her.

On the way, he saw arms and legs—unclear when they had been torn off—scattered about. Sometimes it was a head. Sometimes it was decorative ribbons or beads. White tufts of stuffing were splattered all over, soaked in the bloody hue of the sunset.

At last, he reached the scorched corpse that only her hands still moved.

At that moment, Lisbell violently yanked at the head of a round teddy bear. With her crude grip, the head tore off with a sickening sound. Despite her frail, thin body, the other hand ripped an arm sideways with surprising force and flung it away without a glance. A pile of similarly dismembered limbs had already formed nearby like a heap of corpses.

Rip, tear, pop.

Those grotesque sounds were all birthed from Lisbell’s hands. There were only a few teddy bears left intact around her. The number of mutilated limbs along the path alone was evidence of her relentless destruction.

After brutally destroying the one in her hands, she reached for the next target—but stopped midway. Her head slowly turned.

Her face was unusually flushed. It wasn’t just the teddy bears that were stained by the burning sunset. She too was glowing in raw, saturated red.

As their eyes met, Lisbell let out a confused, half-finished sound.

“Uh…”

“Why?”



“Why do you… look like that?”

The hand that had halted its massacre began to move again, sluggishly. Without breaking eye contact with Ulrich, her sunset-hazed gaze unwavering, she gripped the belly of a new teddy bear with both hands and pulled forcefully.

“You said you’d do this for me…”

 They sat facing each other in silence, not exchanging a single word. Lisbell, gripping the doll’s belly that stuck out like cotton, and Ulrich, gazing at her, seemed as if they were in a scene frozen in time. It was so still that it felt like they had all died, with each second stretching unnaturally long.

The first to move was Ulrich. He kneeled and aligned his gaze with Lisbell’s, then gently took her wrist in his hand.

“Your hand, is it hurt?”

The hand that might have snatched the doll away instead only checked on her, tenderly, as if signaling he never intended to stop her. Without hesitation, he withdrew.

Lisbell continued to stare at him without breaking eye contact. Ulrich met her gaze boldly and smiled slightly.

“So… do you feel a bit relieved now?”



“If it’s still not enough, I can bring more.”



“If you want, I’ll even move the entire doll store from the department store for you.”

Ulrich smiled slyly, as if saying she could have whatever she wished for. His charm was so smooth, there wasn’t a hint of discomfort. Lisbell, with a blank expression, threw the bear doll carelessly.

“Enough.”

Seemingly drained of all will, Lisbell tossed the bear’s shredded remains aside, climbed into bed, and pulled the blanket over herself lazily, lying down in the same way as before.

Ulrich, heading toward the door, gave orders to clean up the chaotic room.

As others moved quietly and busily in and out of the bedroom, Lisbell remained unmoving, her blanket pulled up to her neck. Soon, the bed tilted slightly. The only person who could get into her bed was one: Ulrich. Lisbell unconsciously closed her eyes.

Ulrich’s hand slithered under the blanket like a silk snake, touching her stomach. The cold touch grazed her skin, and after a few strange actions, he withdrew.

After fixing the disheveled blanket, Ulrich stepped away. The bed, which had been slightly tilted, returned to its original position. Lisbell slowly opened her eyes.

She continued to gaze at the side.

In an environment so comfortable, she could not shake the discomfort in her heart. Cold sweat, like a chill, ran down her back.

Thump, thump. The strange, persistent sound in her chest refused to fade.

She still couldn’t understand the man’s intentions.

Did he truly intend to make her stomach flat again?

The silent mental torment continued, leaving her uncertain and uneasy.

A loud, piercing cry woke her up. As soon as she opened her eyes, she found herself surrounded by pitch-black darkness. There was no light anywhere, just a world colored in black, with no indication of up, down, front, or back.

Another sharp cry assaulted her ears, and Lisbell felt a searing pain, as if her body had been torn apart. Before she could even curl her fingers, she screamed, but no sound returned.

Her twisted gaze fell downward, and she saw something perched on her swollen belly.

Flap, flap.

The flapping wings slowly diminished, and the dark, gloomy head bowed.

The next cry was shorter, followed by the sound of a drop of blood hitting the ground, splashing like rain.

Lisbell muttered a foolish sound, but it quickly faded into nothingness. The crow perched on her belly began tearing into her insides, pecking at her organs.

It was a brutal scene, too grotesque to bear. She struggled against the ropes, but they held her firmly in place. The crow spread its wings wide, seemingly enjoying her distress.

Screaming, Lisbell felt her consciousness slipping away, her pain intensifying, but no one came to help. She watched helplessly as her organs were consumed, her body deteriorating, and the crow grew stronger with every passing moment.

The more she died, the more the crow thrived, and the realization of this tragic fate made her feel powerless and despairing.

Her senses faded, and all she could feel was the overwhelming pain. Through her blurred vision, she saw the crow’s beak glistening with blood as it pecked at something between her ribs.

She realized then that the beating heart wasn’t hers.



Suddenly, she came to consciousness.

 

“Ugh….”

 

As soon as Lisbell woke up from her dream, she inhaled heavily like someone suffering from hypoxia. However, she did not feel full at all. As soon as she inhaled, her breath became rapid as if it was being sucked out through the pores of her body. The feeling of her hair, soaked in cold sweat, sticking to her skin was creepy.

 

After a while, she realized that she was lying down looking at the ceiling.

 

Recently, Lisbell had been unable to lie down in this position. Her stomach, which had grown so large that it seemed impossible to hide it any longer, was pressing down on her limbs like a rock. She could not sleep properly in this position, her stomach would often turn inside out, and she would constantly feel the need to urinate.

 

Although lying on her side would have helped her somewhat, she did not do so and barely sat up with her trembling arms.

 

She looked blankly at the window.

 

It was a quiet night, hard to find natural light, and I was alone in the bedroom. The man had not yet returned. If he had, he would have already slept next to me or done something else. Even though I tried to sit still and focus on the quietness of the room where I was alone, a part of my mind kept drifting apart. A chilling blue energy that I could not shake off with my consciousness suddenly rose up and surrounded my chest.

 

It was unpleasant.

 

Lisbell rarely had dreams. But there was a day when she had a vivid dream like today.

 

A crow had appeared there too. She screamed with all her might, but it did not reach anyone, and the sky and the ground were fiercely black as if covered in black raw materials. On that day, when she had a nightmare that made her sweat as she recalled it, Lisbell had captured the circumstances surrounding her mother’s death.

 

Thinking back, it might not have been unpleasantness but ominousness.

 

Because everything was so similar.

 

The crow’s eyes, which looked back at her while biting her heart, which was smaller than her fist, still had a splendid color. Now, just looking at it made her feel like drowning… .

 

The cold sweat on his body gradually cooled down and an uncontrollable coldness came rushing in. As she looked at the room that had been cleaned up in the gloom that made her want to deny reality, the man’s voice came back to her.

 

“Your hand, isn’t it hurt?”

 

It was a voice that seemed to be worried that she might have been hurt. How hypocritical.

 To be clear, she hadn’t intended for things to go this far.

What Lisbell did with the teddy bear had merely been to jolt him into awareness—to remind him of the promise he had made to her.

He had vowed to restore her belly to its former, flat state.

The reason she crawled out from under the narrow, dark table and approached him on her knees was born from that single, desperate desire.

Afterward, she stopped thinking as much as she used to.

Even so, her head would sometimes feel unbearably heavy, and the threshold for her thoughts to spiral had lowered.

Because she was still alive—still breathing—those inevitable thoughts would occasionally rise up like tiny bubbles, then surge into overwhelming waves that crashed down on her.

Whenever that happened, all that remained inside her was burning impulsiveness, leaving her unable to control her own actions.

Lately, there had been exactly one thing that could send her into such a state.

Lisbell’s gaze dropped downward.

Even standing straight, she could no longer see her own feet.

Her swollen belly blocked the view that should have been wide open before her.

He had promised to make it go away.

If he were truly the man who could do anything in her world, then it should have been gone already.

But it remained, stubborn and heavy, anchoring her limbs to the ground. And so Lisbell was in pain. Her wishes had always been simple, unchanged from the beginning—she just wanted a little comfort. She had even crawled across the floor, bruising her knees, in order to put an end to the pain that bound him. Yet all she received in return was the prolongation of that pain.

Moreover, Ulrich had shown glimpses—at times, in ways she couldn’t help but notice—of something unreadable and troubling.

Lisbell clenched her fists. It was clear that all she had left were impulsiveness and frustration. And putting an end to this dragging, miserable process was something she herself could do.

In truth, there was no need to drag things out. There was a quicker way to reach the peace she so desperately sought.

Silently, she moved toward the window of the guest room.

Outside the square window, pale yellow leaves were quietly falling. She had wondered why it had become so cold all of a sudden—only to realize that it was already the height of autumn. The time between the retreating summer and the coming winter. Whether she had intended it or not, whether she had been conscious of it or not, she had once again gotten trapped in a gap between seasons.

‘…What floor was this again?’

High enough to see the thin branches of the towering trees.
Her gaze slid down to the window frame.
Unlike the windows at the Alta Hart mansion, there was no additional lock installed here.
If she pressed down with a little strength, the window would open easily.

‘So if I fall from here…’

It would end.

‘Whether my head shatters, or my belly bursts…’

If she let go of everything like that, it would all be over.

If she could only leap voluntarily into that unknown, death that held no hesitation—

Then it would end.

But—



Lisbell could not go through with it.

Because—

I would just fail again.

Just as someone once said, she was full of thoughts, but even fuller of fear. Even now, she couldn’t help but imagine what would happen if her attempt at death failed.

What if she only ended up critically injured but survived miraculously? What if Ulrich, enraged by her actions, decided to revoke his promise to her? What if she was left, as she had been before when caught by his wife, unable to move freely and forced to await the day of her delivery?

Would today really be the first time she had been seized by such extreme urges? She had harbored them countless times. Whenever she saw a tall staircase, she thought about hurling herself down it; whenever she saw a dish, she wondered about smashing it and using a shard to slit her throat.

These impulses crept in as naturally as breathing for someone still alive.

And sadly, every single time, she arrived at the same conclusion:

She didn’t have the courage to endure what would happen if she failed. And so, she couldn’t even truly wish for death.

“…Haha.”

A hollow laugh slipped from her lips.

It was absurd.

To think there could exist a fear greater than death.

Wasn’t everything supposed to end once she died? And yet, she kept finding herself staring beyond that end.

Perhaps at the root of it all, there was a damp, heavy despair she had acquired after enduring so many situations. It was the sabotage of defeat, carved deep into her bones.

Having never once tasted a victory against Ulrich, Lisbell knew only this kind of bitter, pessimistic psychology. It awakened her dread, severed her thoughts before they could go any further, and left her trembling.

Shivering uncontrollably from the sudden cold, Lisbell hugged her arms around herself. She stumbled back to the bed and buried herself under the covers, pulling them up over her head. Underneath the blanket, she lay utterly still, like a stone.

Before long, she heard the quiet sound of the door opening. Ulrich had returned from his outing. Even as the faint sense of his presence approached, Lisbell stared blankly ahead, as if she could neither see nor hear him.

“Hm?”

A curious voice sounded from behind her. It was the reaction of a man who, upon stepping into the dark, unlit bedroom, had discovered her sitting ghostlike under a heap of blankets. Apparently, he had assumed she would be asleep again, just as she had been for days now, barely awake long enough to see him.

He loosened his tie with a finger and, abandoning his path toward the dressing room, instead approached the bed and sat down. Then, like someone amused by something he had found, he laughed lightly.

“Why are you sitting so cutely like that?”

Even as he came closer, Lisbell’s eyes, which had been staring into empty space, slowly moved toward him. With a faint, hollow expression, like a person stripped of all emotions, she looked up at him—

and with a voice barely above a whisper, finally spoke.

“…I woke up because it hurt.”

“Where does it hurt?”

“My belly…”

Ulrich looked like he was about to ask something else, his lips parting slightly—but then he shut his mouth. Lisbell did the same.

Whenever this topic came up, an indescribable silence always settled between them first.

With her lips pressed shut, Lisbell studied his face.

Ulrich, at some point, lifted the gaze he had lowered.

“Does it hurt a lot?”

Lisbell gave no immediate response. After a long moment, she shook her head slightly. He kissed her forehead, where it peeked through her hair, and whispered,

“I’ll have them bring you some warm tea. Stay lying down.”

Then he stood and made his way back toward the door.

Even though he had told her to lie down, Lisbell didn’t.

She remained exactly where she was, her eyes fixed on the same spot.

But when Ulrich, after giving his instructions, returned to the bed, she turned to look at him again.

He noticed her persistent gaze and teased her lightly, as if pinching at the invisible thread of her attention.

“What are you staring at like that?”

“…Your eyes.”

“Hm?”

“Your eyes.”

Those eyes that glowed blue even in the dark of the night. He looked like a crow from somewhere, covered head to toe in black feathers, with only his eyes shining so coldly and pale. Recalling that image made the dull, stabbing pain in the lower part of her belly throb heavier.

“My eyes?”

Ulrich, seeming not the least bit displeased by her interest, leaned in even closer, almost bringing his face right up to hers.

“Do you like them?”

Not stopping there, he even chuckled softly. Seeing herself reflected and rippling in his blue irises made Lisbell feel sick, so she tore her gaze away.
Ulrich found even that amusing; he chuckled again and left a soft butterfly kiss on her temple before leaning back against the bed’s headboard.

He tugged the loosened tie all the way off, reached out, and fumbled for something on the bedside table. A sharp metallic sound rang out. He had opened a cigarette case, pulled out a cigarette, and placed it between his lips. The motion of his hand moving naturally to light it stopped abruptly, like a short circuit.

As if he had suddenly realized—Oh, right.

Lisbell instantly understood the cause of that hesitation. She didn’t have to think hard about it. Because in the next second, Ulrich cast a quick glance toward her while holding the cigarette between two fingers.

At the moment their eyes met, at the moment he lowered the cigarette from his lips, at the moment he acted as if it were nothing, casually smoothing things over—

Those three blows struck Lisbell like a brutal, merciless beating.

“…Why aren’t you smoking?”

It felt like she had slipped off a crumbling cliff’s edge. The ground that had been holding her heart up gave way with a crash. From that gaping crack, doubts—sharp as thorns and growing long like whips—sprang up furiously, vicious enough to overturn her insides.

Ulrich, who had been idly focused on the bedside table, turned back to her at the sudden accusation. Lisbell’s face was half vacant, almost dazed.

“Why… aren’t you smoking…”

Her words dragged downward, drooping heavily. It was because her voice had started trembling uncontrollably.

“Lisbell?”

“…Because it’s harmful?”



“To me… no, no—to this baby…”

Her delicate features crumbled all at once. Her breath came shorter, more frantically, more wretchedly.

 Lisbell reached out with a broken expression on her face, grabbing the pillow that had fallen to the floor.

“You…”

By the time she dragged it up to her knees, her expression had already turned terrifying.

“You lied to me.”



“You lied to me…!”



“You lied to me! You lied to me…!!”

Lisbell slammed the pillow down on his forearm. In the violent motion, the blanket she had been wrapped in slid down her body. Her body, trembling uncontrollably from the pent-up emotions, became more noticeable.

Ulrich, who hadn’t reacted to the sudden situation at first, quickly grabbed the pillow as if it were going to strike his face.

“Lisbell, wait.”

“You lied to me…! You… you lied to me, didn’t you…! You did, didn’t you?!”

The force behind her refusal to let this go was overwhelming. Ulrich could already see Lisbell’s face, flushed and out of breath, struggling to hold herself together. Her pupils were wide and trembling, a clear sign that something was seriously wrong with her.

He tried to maintain control of the situation, using just enough force to remove the pillow without causing her further strain. Lisbell, however, continued to swing the pillow wildly, hitting him across the cheek and chest.

“What’s going on all of a sudden?”

“I thought… I thought something was wrong.”



“Why did you laugh like that when you looked at a child? Why did you suddenly embrace me so gently? Why did you stroke my belly like it was something precious? Why… why do you refuse to smoke in front of me… Why… why…!!”

The doubts she had been accumulating exploded all at once. The impact was immense. Every last bit of reason she had was shattered, her mind completely thrown into disarray. Her chest felt like it was engulfed in molten lava, as if betrayal and anger were spilling over, causing her vision to throb painfully.

“It was all… a lie. You said you’d… do what I wanted…! You said you wouldn’t make me have the baby…! You promised me… you promised you’d get rid of it…! You promised!”

She didn’t believe it. She should have trusted the person she should have trusted. Instead, she had trusted the one she should never have.

Her heart, as fragile as glass, collapsed, falling deeper and deeper into darkness. She felt as though her insides had been trampled and torn apart, suffocated by an overwhelming hatred.

“And still… you lied to me…! Again! You lied to me again! Again!”

Lisbell had completely lost her reason. She twisted and flailed her limbs violently, like a beast.

The pillow she had been swinging was finally ripped from her hands. Now, Lisbell used both her arms to attack him. Her nails, which had once dug into her neck and now mercilessly scratched at her swollen belly, tore into Ulrich’s cheek and jaw.

Crimson lines appeared on his fair skin. Despite this, Ulrich’s eyes remained unwavering, as if nothing could shake him. She hated it. His eyes, still pristine and untainted, were the exact opposite of her, who was falling apart.

“I… I’ll…”

In her frantic struggle, Lisbell almost fell off the bed, but Ulrich managed to catch her just in time. Twisting in desperation, Lisbell reached for his throat.

“I’ll… kill you…”

Lisbell poured all her energy into fighting him, but as she pushed against his thick arms, which seemed like solid walls, she resorted to biting him, sinking her teeth into his flesh with a vicious snap.

“This time, I’ll kill you!”

At that moment, the door to the room opened.

The servant, who had been bringing in a tray with tea at Ulrich’s instruction, was startled by the chaotic scene and hesitated, before quickly turning to leave. Soon after, footsteps could be heard running toward the room.

“Let go! Let go of me! I’ll kill you…! I will! You… you lied to me… you… you’re trying to torment me again… you played with me, didn’t you… I won’t let this go… I’ll never let you get away with this!”

“Lisbell.”

As the two struggled, Victor, who had been called for, quickly retrieved a box of sedatives. Lisbell, as if trying to completely destroy her voice, continued to scream with vicious intent, cursing him with every word.

“Why… why is this happening to me… I’ll kill you… I won’t forgive you. I won’t let you go… Everything… everything disgusts me. I hate it…! Why… why are you doing this to me…!”

“Lisbell!”

A hand, veins bulging, grabbed her shoulder tightly.

Victor, who had been hastily filling the syringe with liquid, looked up in surprise and turned toward the bed. It wasn’t just him. The voice was unfamiliar to everyone in the room.

Ulrich’s low, rolling voice, always sweet and pleasant, had never sounded so rough, so firm, as if he were shouting. It was something no one had ever heard before.

Even Lisbell, whose emotions had been torn to shreds, flinched helplessly.

Ulrich held her shoulder tightly, his voice sharp as ice.

“I told you I’d take care of it.”



“Why don’t you trust me?”

His voice was clearly coming from directly in front of her, yet there was a strange sense of pressure surrounding it, making it feel as though it were descending from above. It made her involuntarily lower her head and drop her gaze. It was a highly oppressive, almost delicately violent kind of pressure.

It wasn’t just his voice that was creating this sense of domination.

Unlike Lisbell, who could only tremble weakly, his pale blue eyes were firm and resolute. Even with their soft color, they radiated an unsettling, chilling uniqueness that couldn’t be ignored.

With a single, cutting remark, the entire bedroom froze.

Everyone stood still, as though enchanted, unable to move. The first to break the silence, however, was Lisbell.

“How…”

Her facial features, strained and twisted with too much force, contorted. The furious, overwhelming anger that had driven her to lose her senses faded, leaving only a whimper from the broken, crumpled inner turmoil.

“How… How could this… happen…?”



“It’s already… this big…”

Lisbell’s body, still held tightly by Ulrich, lowered slightly.

“I know… there’s not much time left, but how…”

She could not ignore the feeling of pressure, even in her crouched position. The pain in her stomach was sharp, piercing from the inside. It wasn’t just her own discomfort. There was something inside her, something that clung to her fiercely, unwilling to let go…

“I never… trusted you…”

Through her bitter sobs, the broken tone of her voice came in scattered fragments.

“At that time… I should have just pressed the gun to my head… No, no… in the monastery… I should have hung myself there so I’d never leave… No, even before that… I should’ve just… just died with my mother…”



“I should’ve ended it all back then…”

In the once icy atmosphere of the bedroom, the only sound now was the sorrowful, heart-wrenching cry that filled the space.

Lisbell wept uncontrollably, muttering words of despair, as if she had lost all hope for the future.

Ulrich, his face scratched from where she had clawed at him, looked down at her before pulling her closer. Her body, weakened from the emotional turmoil, followed without resistance, as if it had lost its center of balance. For a moment, it almost felt like she was being dragged like a prisoner.

With her face resting on the man’s legs, Lisbell curled her arms and legs, as if trying to return to the original state of things, and wept quietly.

“I don’t want to give birth…”



“I don’t want to… I don’t want to give birth… I don’t want to… I don’t want to… Ugh… I don’t… I don’t want to…”

Her actions, hugging her now obvious, fully visible belly, as tears streamed down uncontrollably, caused everyone in the room to remain silent. None of them dared to speak. It was more accurate to say that they couldn’t.

Ulrich, who was watching the wretched scene from closer than anyone else, gestured silently. Victor, who had been standing by on one side, noticed and set the syringe down. Then he instructed the other attendants who had been waiting with him to leave the room.

 

Lisbell cried until her throat was raw, then fainted from exhaustion. Perhaps the surge of sorrow that had been pent up inside her finally burst forth, because soon after, a fever took hold of her. It was a cold.

 

Ulrich postponed all his scheduled plans and cared for her for several days. That way, he was always by her side whenever Lisbell regained consciousness, even if only briefly, while suffering a severe fever that made her ramble in her sleep.

 

When she woke drenched in cold sweat, Lisbell would look at him with clouded, cracked eyes and, as if possessed, open her mouth.

 

One day—

 

“Mother…”

 

Calling him that, she voluntarily threw herself into his arms with limbs that creaked as they moved.

 

“Mother, it hurts so much…”

 



 

“My stomach… it’s so heavy… I can’t breathe, I’m dying… Please save me. Please, save me… Mother. I… it’s too hard. It really is… too much…”

 

In that way, she called out to the late Madam Osborne, and on another day—

 

“Theo…?”

 

She searched for her former fiancé, whom Ulrich had once impersonated while hiding in the darkness.

 

“Theo… Theo? Theo. Hey, I’m sorry. I’m really sorry. So please, stop. I’ve had enough. I’m already hurting so much. I… I’m sorry. I’m sorry… okay?”

 

She pleaded for salvation from one and apologized repeatedly to another. Whether it was a fever-induced hallucination or a mental collapse finally breaking through after being driven to the edge, no one could tell, but it was clearly not normal.

 

Yet Ulrich did not reject Lisbell when she mistook him for someone else and embraced him. As if it were the most natural thing, he held her, gently wiping the sweat from her forehead and the tear-stained cheeks.

 

“Stop crying.”

 



 

“I told you I’m weak to your crying face.”

 

She thought she heard him say that in her unconscious state, though she couldn’t be sure. Not just that—he seemed to repeatedly whisper that it was okay, that she needn’t worry, that she should rest easy and sleep well.

 

It was caring, but somehow lacking something. Perhaps that was why his comfort always came across as irresponsibly gentle, pushing her deeper into sleep again and again. Her mind faded into a fog, limbs wrapped tight as if being dragged somewhere. The sensation wasn’t of slowly sinking, but of falling. The feeling of descent now seemed almost normal.

 

And so, Lisbell was bedridden for a full two weeks.

 

When the burning fever finally subsided and her blurry consciousness returned to its place, the morning light streaming in felt incredibly pure. It wouldn’t have been strange if the first snow, the color of clouds, had fallen from the sky at that very moment.

 



 

The bedroom was deathly quiet, but Lisbell instantly knew there was a man lying beside her. She could feel the familiar hand that had been wiping her down, the one now toying gently with her loose, overgrown hair—twisting the ends, then letting them fall.

 

Lisbell didn’t reject the touch. She just stared into the blinding sunlight until she couldn’t take it anymore, and closed her eyes as if fleeing.

 

Then she slowly moved her lips.

 

“I’ll do everything…”

 

The hand playing with her hair froze.

 

“If you want me to stay by your side… I will. If you want me to be your spring bride… I’ll do that too. If you want me to pretend to love you like before… I can do that too…”

 



 

“I can do it all…”

 



 

“So, just this one thing…”

 

Tears, which she thought she had no more of, welled up again, cutting through her chest.

 

“Please, just… this one thing…”

 

Even with her eyes closed, she could feel the wetness spreading.

 

Because, because—

 

“Lisbell, how many times do I have to say the same thing?”

 



 

“I told you. Leave it to me.”

 

Hope had long since turned into a discarded scrap. Even hearing such words from a man who once believed anything was possible in this world, she no longer felt the desire to lean on him. She couldn’t rely on him—she had to accept that.

 

By then, Lisbell clearly realized that what she had tried so hard to hold on to was nothing but blind hope. Even with that realization, she didn’t get angry or lash out like before. Because no matter how much her trust had been shattered, the truth remained that he was the only one she had left to hold on to. Even if it was hope wrapped in lies.

 

In a way, she had begun to surrender completely. Her dreams, her future, her will, and everything else…

 

Ah, it had been a long time since she felt this itchy sensation in her throat.

 

‘No…’

 

It wasn’t her throat. Maybe it was her awkwardly protruding belly, or her twig-thin, dried-up ankles. The itching spread like invisible bugs crawling over every inch of her skin. If she could, she would have scratched herself raw with both hands.

 

But Lisbell didn’t touch a single part of her body. She only curled herself slightly inward.

 

The fact that she didn’t even have the energy left to do such a simple thing made one truth blindingly clear:

 

She was going to give birth.

 

She was—

 

—to this child.

 

Death would have been much better…

 

Day by day passed like fleeting moments, as if the absolute and physical concept of time had finally broken down.

 

A day could feel like a minute, and sometimes a minute like a week. After time had stretched and contracted in such chaotic and arbitrary ways, what came was overwhelming pain.

 

One night, Lisbell woke up screaming, her entire body drenched in cold sweat.

 

Perhaps she had never truly been asleep. The relentless thudding in her belly, like someone pounding her from the inside—thud, thud, thud—never ceased, making restful sleep impossible.

 

Once she became conscious of it, the pain surged out of control. Her stomach felt like it would tear apart. It was as if someone was stabbing near her navel with an awl as thick as an arm, slicing through her flesh.

 

Her mind quickly turned hazy. Lights in the once-dark bedroom flickered on one by one, soon brightening the space like daylight. Her vision stung from the deluge of light.

 

Her body, unable even to breathe properly from the pain, was lifted and carried somewhere. Unlike the guest room she had stayed in through several seasons, the new space felt slightly chilly.

 

She couldn’t think. She had merely been lying down, relying on someone else to move her—and just like that, labor had begun. She screamed as someone touched her belly. It was an indescribably grotesque and horrifying sensation. She didn’t understand why she had to endure such extreme pain, and a fear crept in—that her belly might really explode, and she would die.

 

Hiccups… tears burst out, soaking her face. Someone gently touched her features. In a brief moment of clarity, she saw a long, black necktie hanging down. If she could, she would’ve grabbed it and strangled its owner with all her might.

 

Why did she have to suffer like this? She wanted the one who caused it to feel this unbearable pain too. But she couldn’t even try to reach out.

 

“Ahhh…! Hrrng…!”

 

Somewhere, an impatient voice told her to push harder. Lisbell shook her head reflexively. It was too much. The pain was unbearable. She felt like she was dying. Maybe she already was. Every nerve in her body screamed like it had come unmoored. Her muscles were cramping so badly they couldn’t function properly.

 

“It hurts, it hurts… it hurts… It hurts so much…”

 

The sobs caught in her throat, as if trying to block her airway. It felt like invisible hands were strangling her. Her face turned pale. Cold sweat had barely dried before it welled up again, trickling down her temples. Her face was soaked—she couldn’t even tell if it was from sweat or tears anymore.

 

Then, someone held her chin.

 

Something soft pressed against her lips. Only after feeling the gentle pressure did she realize it was lips. Ulrich had suddenly kissed her.

 

Lisbell, who had barely been sustaining her breath with shallow gasps, lost focus in her eyes.

 

Yes, maybe she was meant to wither and die. The thought had barely formed when Ulrich exhaled sharply into her. Unconsciously, she drew in that breath. Like artificial respiration, he breathed into her several more times before slowly pulling away.

 

“Breathe.”

 



 

“Don’t try to die on your own.”

 

It was strange. It was clearly a different phrase, with a different meaning, but it sounded to her as if he were telling her: Don’t think.

 

That binding brand he had seared into the very depths of her heart…

 

Lisbell stared at him blankly, then with trembling hands, she grabbed hold of his tie. Her hand, skin taut and bony, quivered visibly.

 

The next moment, a firm command to push rang out like a roar, and she screamed, giving everything she had to bear down from deep within. Again and again, she repeated the motion. Her vision blurred with the pain of life itself. Her breath reached her throat—then, with sudden exhaustion, it was yanked away.

 

It was the moment she pushed so hard she nearly passed out.

 

Waaah—

 

Waaahhh—

 

A strange and unfamiliar cry rang out. Perhaps it was the sound everyone in that room, except for one, had been waiting for.

Lisbell’s upper body, which had been propped up nearly upright, collapsed backward with a thud. Hah… She breathed so harshly her chest heaved, blankly staring at the ceiling. Sweat that had gathered at her temples streamed down between her cheeks and ears.

 

It was over. It was all over. And it didn’t just mean childbirth. That being—finally, inevitably—had come into the world. That was why it was over. It was the worst possible outcome, the conclusion she dreaded most. Even the final line she believed she could defend had now been breached.

 

Why was it born?

 

Why hadn’t it been extinguished?

 

Why hadn’t it drawn its last breath in the womb?

 

It was predictable. Because even that was a part of Altahart. A stubborn, loathsome pit of toxic humanity. The very root of evil, nurtured by their tainted blood. Despite all her effort to tear it away, it had clung tenaciously to her womb…

 

“Congratulations. It’s a boy.”

 

So disgusting…

 

“Judging by the cry, he seems very healthy.”

 

So horrifying…

 

“May he grow to be as fine a young master as his father.”

 

A monster…

 

Lisbell stared blankly at the nurse’s arms. The being held there was a tiny, fragile lifeform. So small and delicate, it was a wonder how it was even breathing.

 

Disgusting and horrifying—yet utterly unlike the monstrous image she had always imagined.

 

The newborn, with traces of amniotic fluid still dampening its skin, was swaddled in a white blanket. Its minuscule mouth puckered like a baby bird’s beak, as if on the verge of crying. It curled its fingers the size of an adult’s fingertip, wiggling its tightly tucked legs. Every tiny movement absorbed into her gaze felt unreal, impossibly delicate.

 

The nurse turned slightly to show the baby to Ulrich. Unlike Lisbell, his expression went beyond calm to utterly dry. His gaze resembled that of someone evaluating a tool to be used out of necessity.

 

Then, straightening from his leaning position toward the bed, he approached the nurse.

 

Huh…?

 

The next moment, Lisbell doubted her eyes. It was because of what Ulrich did. He traced a cross over the baby’s body, stopping around its abdomen.

 

The sign of the cross.

 

To him, it had always been a religious gesture of blessing and fortitude to overcome trials—but only when done to himself.

 

Done to another person, it bore a completely different meaning. And Lisbell knew exactly what that meant.

 

A ritual most often seen… at funerals. The sign of the cross performed on someone else signified mourning.

 

“Is everything ready for Portley Church?”

 

Ulrich spoke as he drew his hand away from the baby.

 

Lisbell’s grip on the bedsheet tightened. Her pale, bloodless fingertips reflected the state of her heart perfectly.

 

“…Young Master?”

 

The uncertain voice came from Victor, who had been waiting at the side. As someone close to Ulrich, he clearly hadn’t been informed, and the confusion on his face only broke Lisbell further.

 

“Take the baby first.”

 

Unfazed by the reactions around him, Ulrich simply issued the command.

 

Just moments ago, Lisbell hadn’t even had the strength to sit up—but now she was slightly propped up with trembling arms, the tension in the room unmistakable. She didn’t know why, but a scene from a dream flashed through her mind. A crow clawing through her swollen belly with its sharp beak… The dread it brought was suffocating.

 

“Portley Church… why…?”

 

Lisbell already knew the place. Her mother was buried there. Just hearing the name was enough to fill her nose with the stench of death.

 

As if sensing her fear, the baby—held in the nurse’s arms and being taken out of the room—let out a piercing wail. It was as if it desperately wanted someone to know it was here.

 

That overwhelming vitality terrified Lisbell. She thought she had already burned to ash, but the fire rekindled, peeling flesh from her bones. Her face turned even more ashen. She sat on the edge of the bed, staring at the man’s arrogant smile with growing horror.

 

Ulrich reached out and brushed away strands of hair stuck to her sweaty face.

 

“Such a pitiful soul.”

 



 

“There’s family buried there. It won’t rot alone.”

 

As soon as he said that, Victor’s face hardened. He gritted his teeth and abruptly left the room. Not long after, the baby’s crying stopped. The silence that followed pressed in on Lisbell as if trying to crush her.

 

Just moments ago, that being had been here. The one she had guarded against and despised. The one she had thought of as a stubborn, monstrous parasite—yet when the mask came off, it had seemed anything but monstrous. It had been so small, so inherently in need of care.

 

But now, perhaps it was gone.

 

To be precise—

 

Despite his gentle smile, Ulrich’s eyes were chilling. As if digging into her very organs. Lisbell couldn’t look away.

 

Her lips parted. Ulrich gently grasped her chin and lifted it as he said smoothly,

 

“Why that face?”

 



 

“This is what you wanted, isn’t it?”

 

What?

 

Why…?

 

How could this be what she wanted?

 

“You said so… You said you wanted me to do something, anything.”

 

“You told me to take care of it.”

 

A shiver ran through her body.

 

“Why don’t you trust me?”

 

No. It can’t be.

 

“Lisbell, how many times do I have to say the same thing?”

 

“I told you—leave it to me.”

 

No… It couldn’t be that method…

 

“How…”

 

“However it takes.”

 

That confident method of his… Was this it?

 

Was this how he meant to handle it?

 

“Whether I get rid of it inside the womb, or after it comes out…”

 

He murmured it like a final, chilling blow.

 

Suddenly, her entire body felt clammy. Lisbell’s distant gaze dropped to her lower body. Only then did she truly grasp the state she was in.

 

Due to the childbirth, the sheets were stained with a large amount of blood and cold sweat dried in patches, leaving behind wrinkled creases. Her stomach remained excessively swollen despite the emptiness left behind from what had once filled it. These were all irrefutable realities that most directly proved the fact that she had given birth.

 

An event had occurred that could never be undone.

 

“No…”

 

And that’s why—no.

 

“Th-this is…”

 

This truly wasn’t it. No human should ever commit such an act. Even imagining it was horrifying—something no sane mind could endure. Even if that cruel man could do it, she—at least she—couldn’t.

 

“No…”

 

The end of her heart felt like it was burning in agony.

 

She had thought the pain earlier would kill her, but it turned out she was still alive. Now—this moment—felt far closer to death. Because now, she had no choice but to say the words herself.

 

“Don’t do this… please…”

 



 

“Please! Please…! Please, please…”

 

It only made clearer the fact that she would always have to raise the white flag in front of this man.

 

Why wasn’t she hearing any crying? Why had it suddenly cut off so abruptly? Just imagining the answers brought tears streaming hotly from her eyes.

 

She wanted to follow Victor and run out right this second, but having just given birth, even taking a single step was impossible. So all she could do to stop him was—

 

“I-I was wrong.”

 

—beg miserably.

 

“It was all my fault. I-I said something… I couldn’t be responsible for… I-I’m sorry, I’m so sorry. It’s all my fault. I was just overthinking, I was afraid… so please… please…”

 

That child, the seed of Altahart, had to die. Now.

 

But why?

 

What wrong had the baby done?

 

She couldn’t sever that looping thought no matter how hard she tried.

 

When she saw the life wrapped in the swaddle, she’d been stunned. What had she been so afraid of all this time? She even felt a strange sense of futility. But that thought awoke what should never have been awakened. That tender feeling swallowed the monstrous sense of duty that had once driven her to want to end that life—and now, it made the whole situation unbearably painful.

 

In the end.

 

Again.

 

Lisbell’s lips parted as she clutched her head with both hands, like she was going to vomit.

 

“Aaaaaah…!”

 

What poured out was a wretched scream.

 

It was herself—her own reflection before this cruel, unavoidable reality—that made her scream.

 

“Aaaaaah!”

 

Losing everything and gaining nothing. This cycle doomed to repeat until she withered away. Lisbell realized she could never escape it. The only way to survive now seemed to be smashing her own head.

 

“Ah! Ah! Aaaah!”

 

Her ash-grey hair flew through the air as she slammed her forehead against whatever she could. The despair was even deeper because she knew even this violent flailing would be useless in the end.

 

Maybe—just maybe—it would be better to die.

 

Yes, if only she had died sooner, she wouldn’t be suffering like this.

 

Lisbell, crawling and fumbling, rolled off the bed. From below, where nothing had yet been cleaned, blood had flowed out, leaving cruel traces along the path.

 

Thud. Just as her body was about to fall, something caught her, like cradling her. The strength of the grip filled her with revulsion. It was a vice-like hell from which she couldn’t escape once caught.

 

As soon as she realized that, Lisbell tried with all her might to bite down on her tongue. It was her only remaining option. There was no gun, and the window was too far away to throw herself from—so this was the only way left.

 

She braced herself to bite it clean off this time, to make up for her previous failed attempt where she had only ended up foaming blood. But what her teeth closed around wasn’t the familiar soft flesh of her tongue—it was something long and hard.

 

No. That’s not…

 

Something was wrong. Very wrong. She bit down harder, but the result was the same. The metallic taste of blood filled her mouth, but there was no pain.

 

Only then did Lisbell realize what it was: a man’s fingers, invading her mouth, were what she had been trying to chew through.

 

Ah… even her final act…

 

As her consciousness dulled, something pricked her arm. A tranquilizer spread through her veins, and Lisbell’s body slackened and finally stilled.

 

Ulrich, who slowly withdrew his finger from her slightly parted lips, gently brushed back her sweat-drenched bangs and whispered:

 

“This is why I can’t let you go. Truly, my dear…”

 

My conscience.

 

With that soft whisper, Ulrich placed a kiss on Lisbell’s forehead and laid her limp body on the bed, instructing the medical staff to treat her. The doctors and nurses rushed to the bedside.

 

As they examined her and stitched the torn wound, Ulrich loosened his tie. His finger—covered in bite marks, saliva, and blood—was a mess. He wiped it off carefully with a black cloth and pressed his lips to it, quietly smiling.

 

A moment later, as if all his earlier tenderness had been a lie, Ulrich casually tossed the tie aside and walked out the door.

 

Victor, who had taken the baby from the nurse, looked half in shock. The nurse, standing before him, explained with hand gestures that she had merely followed the young master’s instructions to sedate the baby for a thorough examination.

 

Ulrich pushed between them and took the baby into his own arms. As Victor, finally regaining his senses, hurried after him, Ulrich informed him while walking down the carpeted hallway:

 

“Inform the family.”

 

“…Sorry?”

 

Victor blinked in confusion. Ulrich, who had been walking ahead, suddenly stopped.

 

He slowly turned around—but didn’t meet Victor’s gaze. Instead, he looked down lovingly at the peacefully sleeping newborn in his arms.

 

“My one and only…”

 

Gone was the cold stare from earlier, replaced by a face full of warmth and affection.

 

“…heir has been born.”

 

Chills ran down every part of Victor’s body. Just as his eyes met Ulrich’s raised gaze, he finally understood the source of that dreadful sensation.

 

Perhaps this man… from the very beginning…

 

A gut feeling surged—so twisted and terrifying he dared not speak it aloud.

 

Before Victor’s stunned thoughts could fully coalesce, Ulrich turned and walked away again. Through the skylight above the hallway he was passing, the world outside came into view.

 

Under the high, blue sky, small snowflakes were falling ever so quietly.

 

The first snow of the year.

 

A pure, clear thing—plunging straight into the abyss.

 

<Fallen Fruit Under The Paradise> The End
