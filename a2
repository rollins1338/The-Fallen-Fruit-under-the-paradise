She could hardly breathe.

 

She hadn’t known her mother was in such a state until now, and the man who had taken care of her mother, who had been so dangerous, was the same one who had dragged her into this abyss. Now, he was the only one who could verify her mother’s condition.

 

The layered despair tightened around Lisbell’s throat.

 

“It seems the problem started with her bronchial tubes.”

 



 

“It would have been good if something had been done then, but it was neglected and spread to other organs, resulting in this critical state. I heard she was suffering from several illnesses even before she collapsed.”

 

Ulrich placed his book aside and approached the bed. He crouched next to Lisbell, who was sitting beside the bed, meeting her eyes.

 

“If you don’t believe me, I can call the doctor who operated on her to speak with you directly.”

 

His sharp gaze was another form of intimidation.

 

Accusing her of disbelief to her face, challenging her to deny the reality before her eyes.

 

Lisbell felt as though her nerves were coiling like they were facing a giant wave. Instinctively, she turned her head away, only for her chin to be grabbed and pulled back sharply.

 

“So, you should say thank you.”

 



 

“If it weren’t for me, your mother might be in a grave by now.”

 



 

“Despite me saving your mother’s life out of goodwill, Lisbell doesn’t even say thank you.”

 

It wasn’t a mere criticism but a quiet reprimand. Once elegant, now it wasn’t. In the room with just two people and a living corpse, he showed his true nature without hesitation.

 

Lisbell, her face soaked with tears, trembled. Ulrich smiled at her pitiable state. He wiped her wet cheek with his fingers, an act that felt almost coercive, forcing Lisbell to respond.

 

“Th-thank you.”

 



 

“Thank you for saving my mother.”

 

The man who instilled deep-seated fear within her, she had to thank him. The reality was wretched. She hated him for diluting her hatred in this way. With a twisted heart, Lisbell expressed her gratitude.

 

Could anything be more ambivalent?

 

The man who had temporarily crushed her was the same one who saved her mother. She had no choice but to thank him. It was like kneeling before resentment. The nauseating contradiction returned as invisible arrows tearing at her heart.

 

Satisfied with Lisbell’s compliance, he smiled serenely. His hand remained on her face, and so did his gaze. Ulrich’s eyes bore into her tear-streaked, distorted face.

 

When his gaze became unbearable, he finally withdrew his hand.

 

Lisbell quickly raised her arm to wipe her face.

 

From now on, she needed to pull herself together. Knowing her mother’s condition was so severe, there were many practical matters to consider.

 

In truth, she wanted to escape Ulrich’s realm as soon as possible. She couldn’t bear him grasping her weaknesses one by one.

 

“I will never forget this favor. I will take care of my mother from now on…”

 

“Who said you could?”

 

“…What?”

 

“Who said you could take her away?”

 

“What do you mean…”

 

“The surgery costs, the hospitalization fees…”

 



 

“You can’t be so naive. Are you so unaware of the ways of the world?”

 

Lisbell’s expression stiffened.

 

Yes, he was right.

 

It was a considerable amount of money that Ulrich had spent on her mother’s treatment, a sum that was meant for Lisbell’s family.

 

Knowing this, it was still hard to conceal her bitterness.

 

While in Marnia, he had willingly paid for even her personal expenses. She knew it was improper, but this amount wouldn’t even dent his finances. Yet, mentioning costs now was…

 

“Are you saying I should repay you?”

 

“Everything should be accounted for.”

 



 

“If word gets out that I let someone off without paying, what will happen to Altahart’s reputation as a businessman?”

 

Resigned to the inevitable, Lisbell closed her eyes tightly. Unwiped tears rolled down her pale cheeks. Ulrich watched her as if he might lick away the traces and then stood up.

 

He handed her a document from a table. With trembling hands, Lisbell took it.

 

The detailed figures made it clear it was an estimate from the hospital.

 

But the amount was much larger than she expected.

 

How could she pay this?

 

Even if she abandoned her wedding plans and used all her savings, it was doubtful she could cover it. Moreover, if she used all the money for the surgery, what about the future treatment costs for her mother?

 

The more she thought, the more hopeless it seemed.

 

Each clash with reality extended her thoughts into pathetic directions. Finally, she had to speak.

 

Could anyone in Rechem boast of wealth before this man? She rationalized, telling herself now wasn’t the time for pride, and her flimsy justifications became her only solace.

 

“I’m sorry, but I don’t have the means to repay…”

 

“No money.”

 



 

“Then what else?”

 

Was he talking about valuables? Lisbell, who had lived as a commoner with no interest in adornment, had none.

 

“I don’t have any.”

 



 

“I have nothing.”

 

“You have nothing?”

 



 

“You have your body.”

 

Before her hesitant words could reach him, Ulrich’s fingers touched her body. His hand moved to her chest, an area too intimate for anyone else to touch so casually.

 

“You have this body.”


Chapter 39.


Tap.

 

With a firm push, his playful gesture nudged her body backward.

 

Thus, Lisbell understood his hidden intention a beat too late. But even understanding didn’t mean she could act immediately. In reality, she was frozen with another meaning, unable to blink an eyelid.

 

“I could do it right now.”

 

The corners of the man’s eyes folded like a hawk’s wings. Smiling leisurely and beautifully, he slowly lowered his fingers.

 

From her chest to her solar plexus.

 

“I want to go in here.”

 

Past her navel, sinking in a little lower…

 

“…Ah…!”

 

The movement was sudden. It might even be called a desperate struggle.

 

The moment Lisbell realized where Ulrich’s hand was headed, she twisted her body. However, Ulrich, who had anticipated her move, pushed her down forcefully.

 

Her ash-gray hair spread across the cold hospital floor. Lisbell stared dazedly at the sinister figure looming over her.

 

“…I’ll pay it back somehow.”

 

“How?”

 

“By any means necessary…”

 

“By any means?”

 

“So please… don’t do this.”

 

“What have I done?”

 



 

“Naive and yet so scared…”

 



 

“See, I told you you’re just like a cat.”

 

Ah, his playful attitude only made her feel more ridiculous.

 

It wasn’t as if he was recklessly charging at her like last time, but she felt no relief. His eyes, looking down at her so detachedly, only reflected the primal joy of a beast cornering its prey for sport.

 

“My wedding is not far off.”

 

“I know, it’s late summer now.”

 

“I’m getting married…”

 

“Do you want me to congratulate you again?”

 

It felt like talking to a wall. Whether he felt the same way or not, Ulrich squinted as if he couldn’t understand, then let out a soft “Ah” and smirked. He lifted his damp fingers to her cheek.

 

“Do you think I’m asking you to give up on your wedding?”

 



 

“I’m not. If you want to be the bride in late summer, then go ahead.”

 



 

“But can you really do that?”

 

Though his tone was gentle, his words pierced her heart savagely.

 

“You plan to offer your body to another man and then still go through with your engagement? Do you think you can handle that with your weak nature?”

 

His sneer was biting.

 

He always ridiculed her.

 

Only now was she vaguely realizing that this was how he always saw her. Ulrich might have always been mocking her. She had thought he might be good at acting, but that didn’t mean she was exempt from being his target.

 

Ulrich’s flawless social skills might have extended even to her.

 

“You…”

 

As soon as she uttered a word, she realized her mistake. Her pale face and trembling lips revealed her fear.

 

“Have I made a mistake towards you?”

 

“Mistake?”

 

“If not, then why…”

 



 

“Why do you keep doing this to me…?”

 

It was no coincidence. Amidst the continuous incidents, Ulrich’s malice was vividly alive. Even if it was an elaborate plot to bring her down, it was no exaggeration.

 

The theft incident that never happened didn’t need to be mentioned, and this time was no different. While her mother’s condition might have been a coincidence, the fact that he covered the surgery costs to use it against her was entirely his intention and choice.

 

At this point, it was clear to her.

 

Ulrich continuously put her in difficult situations.

 

So, it was all intentional.

 

He had a natural talent for creating situations. With his background and money, there was nothing he couldn’t do, instilling both reverence and fear in her. No matter how much she struggled, she realized it was futile against him…

 

She couldn’t understand why, so she finally voiced it.

 

Mocking me, tormenting me, constantly pushing me like this. What is the underlying reason? Lisbell had no choice but to become genuinely curious.

 

“Why are you doing this?”

 

He looked as if he had been asked an obvious question.

 

“It’s simple.”

 



 

“I can do this.”

 

His eyes, now fully revealing their depths, were chillingly clear. They showed the truth, ideals, and reality. Ulrich truly, without a shadow of a doubt, believed it.

 

“Lisbell, you want to marry Mr. Motier.”

 



 

“I’m doing this because I want to.”

 



 

“Does desire need any more reason?”

 

He whispered, simply saying he wanted to, as if his words were an inexplicable noise in the distance.

 

Lisbell’s eyes fluttered. Tears that hadn’t yet dried flowed down her cheeks.

 

Ulrich eventually wiped them away with his fingers and brought them to his lips. Although it was just a drop of tears, it felt as if her soul had been sucked out… Was this feeling connected to the despair slowly consuming her whole body?

 

Cicadas chirping.

 

The sound of cicadas, a symbol of summer, disrupted the morning hospital atmosphere.

 

The intense sound would fade with time, as was the nature of the returning seasons.

 

But Lisbell couldn’t imagine the end of summer as clearly as before. No matter how hard she tried, it remained blurry as if smudged by her hands.

 

She was certain of one thing.

 

If she hadn’t set foot in Marnia, his paradise, she wouldn’t have ended up at this foolish crossroads.

 



 

Her pupils, widened in shock, gradually calmed.

 

People often make foolish choices even when they know they’re wrong.

 

That’s how Lisbell was now.

 

Her mother lying unconscious in a hospital bed, the secret she hid from Theodore, the insurmountable financial problems, and the precious future she still wanted to protect…

 

Cicadas chirping.

 

The sound of cicadas was still intense.

 

Summer, the season of breeding.

 

Lisbell couldn’t shake off the thought that her misfortune, which fell upon her suddenly, was also breeding like that.

 



 

“…Ugh.”

 

Her curled-up body shrank even more inward. Like a small pill bug rolling away after being tapped by someone’s foot, Lisbell only showed movements of wanting to hide somewhere. Each time the man’s persistent breath fell on her back, it was the same.

 

“Hah…”

 

His breath was as hot and heavy as if he had swallowed the scorching summer sun.

 

Each drop felt like a heavy rock, difficult to bear. It didn’t just settle; it poured down. The unusual temperature and rhythm made it clear what he was doing now.

 

“Ugh, Ah…!”

 

Lisbell, who was rubbing her forehead against the sheet, wanted to bury her face entirely to muffle the inevitable moans.

 

But just the other day, she had been severely scolded for trying to stifle her moans. The man had developed a new hobby of listening to her moans. Any attempt to disrupt his newfound pastime was met with harsh retribution.

 

Ulrich, exhaling warm breath, pushed aside the slip covering her back.

 

The rough feel of the lace trim on the slip was strange. Lisbell normally didn’t wear such lacy slips. The fact that she was wearing this and on this bed was entirely his doing.

 

Under the ‘repayment contract’, a few bedroom rules had been established.

 

First, when called, Lisbell must stop whatever she was doing and come to Ulrich’s bedroom. Second, she must wear a slip that was easy to remove.

 

Because of this, with just one movement of his hand, Lisbell had to expose her clean, dry back.


Chapter 40.


Ulrich poked at her sharply raised shoulder blade with his fingertip and pressed the soft flesh firmly with his penis.

 

“Uh…!”

 

Lisbell’s rounded shoulder line trembled. It wasn’t just there that convulsed. The lower part, filled with his entire length, also trembled as if strained.

 

“Lisbell, huh….”

 

In that state, he pressed his pubic bone fully against her perineum, making their lower bodies one. As he gently scratched the entrance with the veins on his penis, Lisbell, who was lying down, vibrated as if hit by a spark.

 

Ulrich, wearing a languid smile, rubbed and ground the deep spot with his glans fully inserted.

 

“Ha, ugh! Ah….”

 

“The place you feel is deep.”

 

“Huh, huh…!”

 

“I noticed you react when I touch deep inside your throat too.”

 

“Ah, Ah…!”

 

“I thought it was because it was your first time… but it seems you were born with this preference.”

 

It was Ulrich’s talent to speak elegantly yet crudely. Using that talent without filter, he grabbed her buttocks that curved temptingly. The slight flesh of her buttocks fit perfectly in his hand as he traced the overall outline.

 

Holding it tightly, not allowing any escape, Ulrich relentlessly pounded the inside. The penis, already covered in her fluids, squelched as it moved out, spraying sticky droplets.

 

Licking his lips, he observed the debauched traces. Twisting her buttocks until the flesh was mashed, he spread them wide, making the eager entrance, swollen with small wrinkles, more visible.

 

When he fumbled with one finger, feeling the fervent traces, Lisbell shrank her reddened nape. Smiling silently at her sensitive reaction, he adjusted his posture and thrust deeply into her inner wall.

 

“Ughi Ah, Ah…!”

 

Her split buttocks crumbled without resistance, struggling to contain his forearm-sized cock.

 

“Do you know that your belly tenses whenever I rub inside like this?”

 

“Uh, ung….”

 

A snicker. This time, a rather loud laugh descended. Lisbell was now afraid of his laughter. Ulrich no longer hid his sneer towards her. She feared what kind of ridicule it would be, a learned response from past experiences.

 

“You said you wanted to do it from behind first.”

 

“Uh, uh, ah, ah….”

 

“Was it all for this? Hm?”

 

He straightened his spine and slapped, slapped, slappedi pounded Lisbell’s buttocks as he thrust fiercely. Every time the tip of his penis, snaking its way through the curves, hit the stimulation point, white spots burst in her head. She could only clutch the hapless sheet and gasp.

 

No. It wasn’t for that reason at all.

 

The reason for insisting on this position….

 

“You’re trying to have fun in your own way… right.”

 

“Huh….”

 

“Well, I agree. If you’re going to have sex, it’s better to enjoy it together. Probing and touching where it feels good….”

 

Ulrich, panting shortly, quickly shook his pelvis. Each time the man thrust his hips fervently, Lisbell felt as if she were sinking deep somewhere. Even though she was on the bed, it felt like being driven into the cold, hard floor below, inducing a sense of self-loathing.

 

“Huh! Uh…! Ah… uh…!”

 

A large hand crawled inside her nearly stripped slip. Already overwhelmed with tingling and heat, she was disoriented, but his hand still grasped her breast, hitting the peak. The pulling sensation, as if to tear the scant flesh away, spread a numbing sensation. His hands, twirling her nipples, immediately soothed the pain. It was a disorienting caress.

 

“Ah, uh! Ugh…!”

 

“Ah… tight again. Unless you’re trying to turn me into a premature ejaculator, why don’t you relax a bit.”

 

Ulrich, snickering, grabbed her breasts firmly without wasting any motion and thrust forcefully.

 

Between Lisbell’s reddened buttocks, Ulrich’s clean penis moved in and out relentlessly.

 

As a result, only Lisbell’s pubic hair, moistened with fluid, stuck to her skin. Ulrich, finding the hair similar in color to her own, fondled it curiously while continuing to thrust.

 

Every time he forcefully penetrated the pleasingly tight interior, a thrilling tension pulled at the back of his neck. Like an animal savoring a taste, he licked his lips multiple times, thumping her buttocks rhythmically with his pelvic bone.

 

Even a single thrust pushed so deep that the pressure of organs being squeezed was unrelenting. This made Lisbell, while being penetrated, subconsciously feel her lower abdomen several times. Though knowing it was impossible, she worried her belly might bulge bluntly.

 

“Huh, ah, ah, Ah…!”

 

The erratic speed, alternating between fast and slow like a playful game, began to quicken again.

 

This time, it felt a bit different. Lisbell sensed he was ready to release the built-up sexual tension and clenched her toes, bracing her lower belly.

 

He twisted her erect nipples, hoping she’d better swallow his swollen penis. The force was such that her coral-colored breasts might be pulled out whole. Sometimes he would neglect to exert force where needed and, conversely, handle delicately areas that needed careful attention roughly.

 

“Aahi Ughi Ahi Ah, Ah…!”

 

Lisbell’s high-pitched moans filled the dark bedroom as Ulrich, grabbing her split buttocks, pulled back. His penis, hard with imminent ejaculation, swelled. The robust organ barely exited, scratching the wet entrance.

 

As Lisbell gasped, her prone body was grabbed, flipping her vision upside down.

 

Having kept her eyes closed throughout the ordeal, the invading light in her barely opened eyes was faint. Unable to gather her sprawling limbs, Ulrich grabbed her chin.

 

“Time to do it.”

 

And third, instead of ejaculating inside, she must always receive his semen orally.

 

Lisbell, with her moist eyelids trembling, slowly parted her lips.

 

Straddling her face, Ulrich looked at her red, crumpled eyes and stroked his trembling penis. His hand movement was obscenely suggestive.

 

The veins on its surface pulsated violently. The thick shaft and the split testicles below seemed impatient to release their fluid, responding obscenely.

 

He shifted his gaze to her slightly open lips and stiffened tongue. As if imagining a rough suck, he eyed her fiercely and pressed his blunt glans into her small mouth.

 

“Uh, ugh….”

 

White semen spurted out thickly. Not a single drop of the arousal byproduct escaped Lisbell’s mouth.

 

The sticky taste sweeping through her mouth was torturous. Knowing he wouldn’t like it, Lisbell nonetheless couldn’t help but frown.

 

He smirked, touching her face, which was marred with unsightly wrinkles.

 

“Warm.”

 



 

“Lisbell seems to have a knack for taking things in, either from above or below.”

 

Ulrich, making that comment about Lisbell’s mouth filled with his glans, didn’t withdraw immediately after ejaculating but lightly shook his hips. Although only the glans was inserted, its sheer size made it feel like her mouth was completely full. It was like having someone’s clenched fist in her mouth.

 

The overwhelming weight of the penis, threatening to tear her inner walls of mouth, made Lisbell struggle.



Chapter 41.


Ulrich persistently shook his waist to extract all the liquid before finally pulling the tip out of her mouth.

 

As the accumulated semen inside was pushed out, the white mucus trailed along his organ and her parted lips. Ulrich chuckled at the messy sight and gestured to his genitals.

 

“Will you lick it clean?”

 



 

“You promised to eat it all.”

 

Lisbell stared at him with teary eyes before slowly sticking out her tongue. As she extended her tongue like a cat to lick his erect glans, she felt like a cheap prostitute selling her body for a few coins.

 

Wanting to break away from these self-destructive thoughts, Lisbell hurriedly licked his glans.

 

Ulrich, letting out a deep moan, adjusted the position of his head to make it easier for her to lick.

 

Her soft, wet tongue grazed the thick skin of his glans, the erotic curves on the top, and the small urethral opening in the center.

 

Though slightly softened after one ejaculation, his penis quickly became stimulated and began to swell again under the delicate movements of her tongue. Fully aware of his reaction, Lisbell closed her eyes in despair. Even in this situation, fearing his wrath, she couldn’t stop her tongue. It was the submissive stance of a weakling.

 

“You’re quite good at this now.”

 



 

“When I first told you to do it, you were drooling all over the place.”

 

After confirming that his penis was clean with no traces of semen, he pulled back. Lisbell, withdrawing her tongue which had become numb from the teasing, looked troubled.

 

Ulrich quickly grasped the reason. Like his straight, erect penis, his neatly sprouted fingers pried open Lisbell’s half-closed lips.

 

“…Ugh!”

 

“Swallow it.”

 

As expected, he confirmed the accumulated semen inside her mouth and sneered. Suspecting she would spit it out when he wasn’t looking, Ulrich pushed his fingers deeper.

 

The intruding fingers soon reached the back of her throat. Lisbell’s legs, pinned beneath him, thrashed as if she were being strangled.

 

Ignoring her violent resistance, Ulrich pushed his fingers deeper into her narrow, wet mouth.

 

Gulp.

 

The taste that finally went down her throat seemed to spread a fishy smell throughout her body.

 

Lisbell, having accidentally swallowed with his fingers still deep in her throat, couldn’t help but retch. As soon as he withdrew his fingers, which had been buried so deep that no knuckles were visible, Lisbell turned her body sharply.

 

“Ugh, ugh…!”

 

As she gagged and curled up, Ulrich gently stroked her tangled hair as if feeling sorry for her.

 

Comforting someone suffering from his actions was truly something only Ulrich could do.

 

Though she wanted to immediately brush away his hand, disgusted, she had no strength left. After a few dry heaves, Lisbell finally regained her composure, but before she could hold onto it, her body was dragged.

 

“Swallowing is nice and all.”

 

“…Ung…”

 

“But it’s a bit disappointing that I can’t kiss you afterward.”

 

“Ung… ugh.”

 

“Sucking on Lisbell’s tongue is surprisingly pleasant.”

 

His gaze, staring at her still-wet lips, was displeasing. Despite his penchant for bizarre acts, it seemed he couldn’t bring himself to kiss her mouth filled with his own semen.

 

Instead, he bit her nipples, visible through the thin slip.

 

“Ung…”

 

Lisbell’s hands grabbed his shoulders as if to push him away. Her normally numb nipples felt a sharp thrill from just one flick of his tongue.

 

A man who pulled her to bed every single day, he never forgot to torment and nibble at her breasts. Despite her complaints, he never let go once he bit down.

 

He showed such attachment that sometimes he would bury his face in her flat chest and dawdle.

 

Due to these frequent teases, her breasts had become so sensitive that even a slight pinch or bite could make her back twist.

 

“Mm, mm…”

 

Lisbell moaned under him as he persistently licked her nipples through the slip. It was her desperate attempt to resist the strange sensation.

 

Has it been about two weeks?

 

Since they began sleeping together.

 

The pain that had dragged her to a living hell on the first night was, fortunately or unfortunately, no longer present. After a few nights, Ulrich learned her sensitive spots, and his quick, efficient lovemaking left Lisbell trapped in waves of unfamiliar pleasure instead of the splitting pain.

 

And each time she realized she was feeling it, she was filled with crushing self-loathing.

 

Feeling sexual pleasure from another man’s touch, not Theodore’s, in such a demeaning way, was unthinkable.

 

She was no different from a beast driven only by instinct.

 

Yet her body, betraying her reason, continued to commit this unimaginable act. The burden on her conscience grew heavier each day.

 

“Ha, ugh… stop…”

 

“Stop?”

 

Ulrich, catching her slip of the tongue as she inadvertently voiced her restraint while struggling, asked back as if to catch her off guard.

 

He lifted his head slowly, letting go of her nipple through the slip. His crooked gaze sent a shiver of unease, and then he smirked.

 

“You don’t like it through the clothes?”

 

He immediately pulled the slip aside. Her barely protected breasts were now fully exposed. Burying his nose in her non-existent cleavage, he circled his tongue around the protruding tip.

 

“Ah…!”

 

Lisbell twisted her waist and let out a scream.

 

The difference between being sucked through the clothes and directly on her skin was subtle yet significant. The transfer of saliva from his tongue and how it trailed was conveyed clearly.

 

Indeed, as if substituting for the kiss he couldn’t give, Ulrich stubbornly clung to her nipples.

 

Even the slightest friction from his tongue was enough to make her waist twist, showing how sensitive her breasts had become. He deliberately made a loud sucking sound as he slid his hand down to her groin.

 

“Ung, stop… ah…”

 

Resistance was futile. Before she could even fully voice her protest, two fingers entered her at once, spreading her open.

 

Already melted from several rounds of him tonight, her inner walls parted easily as he scissored his fingers and licked her nipples.

 

Lisbell threw her head back. At some point, her mouth had filled with saliva, unable to swallow as her breath hitched. Meeting Ulrich’s gaze, she knew she couldn’t stop.

 

“No, I don’t want this…”

 

“You don’t want it?”

 

“Ung, ahi Ung…”

 

“Yet you’ve already taken three fingers?”

 

Without her realizing, the number of fingers increased to three, stretching and probing her inner walls. His fingers skillfully targeted her sensitive spots, making her shake her head. The more violently she reacted, the more Ulrich teased her nipples and moved his fingers faster inside her.

 

“Ah, ah… ahh… mm…”

 

Her groin grew wetter as her body trembled with each pulse. She felt her insides heating up, a terrifying and unpleasant sensation.

 

In the end, her face turned red as she clung to Ulrich’s arm.

 

Finally, the fourth finger.

 

“Ah, from behind, ah, from behind, Ulrich…i”

 

The position was always so she couldn’t see his face, with Lisbell on her stomach.

 

As could be inferred, the rules of their bed play were a strict compromise. For every term from Ulrich’s side, there was a term considering Lisbell’s stance.

 

She saw the contract on the day she returned to this villa and signed it with trembling hands in front of him. How did he react?

 

Ah…

 

He smiled, just like now.

 

Mocking her desperate behavior, Ulrich firmly held Lisbell’s trembling thighs and thrust inside as he pleased. The three fingers, now moving rapidly, turned into a thick rod, tearing her insides apart.

 

“Ah, ah, ah… ahi”

 

Feeling the mess between her legs, goosebumps rose on her skin. Again, the familiar mixture of strange pleasure and self-hatred overwhelmed her.

Chapter 42.


“Wasn’t it just for sex that you wanted to do it from behind?”

 

“Ah, ah, ah, yes…i Ahhh…i”

 

“This isn’t sex. This is, um….”

 

While prodding and rubbing her wet hole with three fingers, he casually remarked.

 

“This is me helping Lisbell have some fun.”

 

“Ung, ah…i Ah, Ah…!”

 

He relentlessly played with Lisbell’s insides as she desperately tried to escape.

 

When she curled up on her side, he continued his actions by lifting one of her overlapping legs. Eventually, he removed two fingers, leaving only his longest middle finger to stir the murky liquid flowing below.

 

“Ah, ah… ugh…!”

 

Caught in a near ecstasy, Lisbell reached a trembling climax.

 

As soon as she came, Ulrich withdrew his finger, which had been twisted so erratically it defied rhythm. An opaque liquid trailed down his fingertip.

 

“Haa, ha…”

 

Her vision blurred, her mind shattered.

 

The lingering pleasure left all over her body pushed her deeper into a twisted guilt.

 

Every time she did this with Ulrich and felt it intensely, Theodore’s face would come to mind.

 

It felt like committing adultery.

 

She couldn’t stop crying when suddenly her waist was grabbed, and she was dragged, face down, onto the sheets.

 

The strength spreading her buttocks revealed an unseen lust.

 

An insatiable, grotesque sexual appetite.

 

A terrible sensation of a slippery, massive volume slowly pushing into her cleft.

 

Lisbell buried her tear-streaked face in her arm and quietly wiped away her tears.

 

Opening her weary eyelids, Lisbell realized she had fallen asleep. Curled up in the middle of the bed without a pillow, she blinked sleepily.

 

Just then, the sound of water from beyond ceased.

 

Soon after, Ulrich, with a nightgown over his sculpted naked body, appeared, running his hand through wet hair.

 

“Did you wake up?”

 



 

“You were sleeping so quietly, I thought you might be dead.”

 

Ulrich, making a statement that seemed like a joke, nonchalantly approached the drink table in the bedroom.

 

He always had a whiskey after sex. Though, it seemed not just because of sex. He appeared to be a drinker. Eventually, she found out that there were drink tables with decanters scattered throughout the villa.

 

Today too, he filled his glass generously and took a sip before turning back to the bed.

 

Seeing him, Lisbell pushed away the loosely covered blanket and tried to sit up. The idea that she had slept soundly here felt absurd.

 

Having just woken up, she intended to return to her own bedroom but couldn’t manage it. Every action, from bracing herself on the sheets to lifting her torso and properly sitting down, was more exhausting than she had imagined.

 

The pain from the sex might have subsided, but the lingering muscle soreness was still there. Honestly, she felt too weak to even move a finger. Thinking about returning to her bedroom on another floor made her sigh.

 

More than returning, she wanted to wash away his remnants on her body. When she touched her abdomen to pull off the blanket, she felt something sticky. As soon as she wiped it with her palm, she knew what it was.

 

It was Ulrich’s semen.

 

She remembered it vividly. She had fallen asleep during the act, so he had ejaculated all over her body as if in frustration.

 

Her entire body felt dirty with traces of fatigue and bodily fluids. But she was so exhausted that she couldn’t do anything about it. Even though she was awake, she felt like she was still wandering in a dream.

 

“Want a drink?”

 

Ulrich, watching her from a tilted stance, shook his empty crystal glass.

 

Lisbell touched her lips.

 

It was strange. She hadn’t been conscious of it a moment ago, but the mention of a drink made her want to rinse her mouth. It felt as if the semen he had discharged into her was still filling her mouth.

 

She wanted to run to the bathroom and rinse, but in her current state, even that seemed impossible.

 

Besides, would water be enough to rid her of this taste?

 

She thought it might be better to use the high-proof alcohol, so Lisbell nodded slightly.

 

He poured the crystal glass generously. The sound of pouring filled the quiet bedroom. The space that had been filled with her moans and his breath always felt awkward.

 

Lisbell took the glass he handed her.

 

As soon as she carefully swallowed a sip, she started coughing violently.

 

Lisbell grabbed her throat. It was just a sip. Yet it felt like her esophagus was burning. She had heard whiskey was strong but hadn’t imagined it would taste this harsh.

 

The glass slipped from her grasp and rolled off the bed, spilling its contents and wetting the floor. Ulrich looked at the spill and then at Lisbell, who was still coughing with a flushed face, and burst into laughter.

 

“…ugh…!”

 

The next moment, he pounced on the bed.

 

As his damp blonde hair rustled, Lisbell’s body had already crumpled. He had jumped on her and hugged her tightly.

 

Lisbell felt like dying in a different way.

 

Her whole body already ached as if trampled, and now, on top of the effect of the strong liquor, being pinned down by a much larger man left her disoriented.

 

But her dismay was brief; Lisbell wriggled to escape his embrace.

 

“Let go, let me go. I need to go back to my room….”

 

“Why not stay here tonight? You look too weak to even get up.”

 

Lisbell opened her mouth but then closed it firmly.

 

From her experiences, she knew he was very stubborn. Once he decided on something, he would make sure to see it through. He might say she could do as she wished, but the reality was different. She already saw him in a negative light.

 

Dragging her tired body into an argument, risking another session starting, would be bad for her. She was so exhausted that she could fall asleep immediately if she closed her eyes.

 

I must smell right now….

 

Unlike Ulrich, who had cleaned up, she hadn’t even gotten rid of the sweat accumulated overnight. Falling asleep during sex meant she wasn’t in a clean state.

 

Thinking about it briefly, she changed her mind.

 

Lisbell remembered the repayment contract he had handed her in the parlor. He had proposed replacing her debt with sexual intercourse, specifying the term clearly.

 

The period extended to late summer, almost the end of autumn.

 

Seeing that, Lisbell realized clearly that contrary to his words about not interfering with her marriage to Theodore, he was intent on ruining it. Otherwise, there would be no reason to keep her until late summer.

 

“The period written there could change.”

 



 

“If I get tired of you before then, the contract will end there.”

 

His nonchalant comment while holding a cigarette had struck her deeply. For her, a situation shaking the foundation of her life was just a whim for him, ending whenever he got bored.

 

Was he telling her to have hope or to sink into despair?

 

His words left her uncertain.

 

Ultimately, both despair and hope remained for Lisbell. The nightly endurance was despair, while hope was naturally….

 

[- What do you mean, Lisbell? Postpone the wedding?]

 

When she signed the contract, she didn’t cry. But tears welled up when she called Theodore.

 

Listening to his urgent voice on the other end, Lisbell couldn’t respond immediately. Leaning against the wall, hearing him ask what happened made her feel choked up.

 

All she wanted was to marry Theodore.

 

But why had things turned out this way? Lisbell felt confused and overwhelmed, fearing she might never escape this maze. By the time she realized, her face was already drenched in tears.


Chapter 43.


Drip, drip.

 

I lifted my head hurriedly after only watching the traces of falling droplets on the floor. Theodore’s insistent questioning, sensing something was wrong from my lack of response, demanded my attention.

 

[What’s going on? Are you in trouble? If you’re in Marnia right now, I’ll come to you. Lisbell. Let’s meet and talk.]

 

“No.”

 

[No?]

 

“Don’t come, Theo. You… there’s no need for you to come here.”

 

Swoosh~

 

Guilt stirred again, like a mischief.

 

What started as a small seed had grown to the size of a fist, pounding relentlessly against Lisbell’s heart.

 

[No need…?]

 

Such words born from that kind of heart only led to awkward misunderstandings.

 

Lisbell bit and released her lips as she listened to his reaction over the receiver.

 

Even in this moment, intense dilemmas flooded her mind.

 

Should I tell Theodore everything?

 

Should I tell him that this is happening to me, that the current situation is such that I cannot leave Marnia, that my mother’s life is tied to that man, and that I cannot irresponsibly abandon her to return to you…?

 

Her fingers gripping the receiver turned pale.

 

Soon, a dry laugh slipped quietly.

 

What If I tell him?

 

If I tell him, will all this misfortune that has come to me be resolved?

 

No.

 

Of course, if it were Theodore, he would surely step in wholeheartedly. If I told him I was held hostage for my mother’s surgery costs, he would help with all he had, even if it meant using the funds meant for the wedding. But even if he stepped in, the wedding would still have to be postponed.

 

Even if we managed to repay my mother’s surgery costs and secure our livelihood, what about after that?

 

The repayment contract Ulrich presented included all hospitalization fees for the specified period. The price for her being in his bed was that high. The thought that her mother’s future treatment costs would not be insignificant kept her from stopping such self-destructive judgments.

 

Misfortune doesn’t lessen when shared. It only increases the burden, creating two hardships instead of one. Comforting herself would be brief, but the heavy reality would continue to tighten its grip.

 

That’s why misfortune is called misfortune.

 

Lisbell thought it was enough for her alone to tumble within this misfortune. She loved Theodore too much to drag him further in.

 

In reality, she knew well that, for his sake, she should be asking for a breakup to prevent him from getting hurt any further.

 

But she couldn’t bring herself to do it.

 

Now, this was the only hope she could hold onto…

 

If even this were gone, she wouldn’t be able to endure her time in this villa. Even if it was merely a result of her selfishness, without that small straw, she had nothing else to grasp…

 

“Sorry, Theo. I’ll explain everything later. I’d like to postpone the wedding date to winter.”

 

Her selfishness manifested so clearly. Even if it seemed difficult, she couldn’t utter the words suggesting a breakup. She was fully aware that Theodore might end up disappointed in her and take such a step himself, but still…

 

In truth, she knew Theodore wouldn’t do that.

 

Since she was the one who loved him the most, having known him to always be kind and gentle.

 

That phone call was her last contact with Theodore.

 

And two weeks had passed since then.

 

Lisbell recalled the phone call she ended without hearing an answer and shivered. A strong arm pulled her back firmly by the waist. Ulrich’s gestures were always like this. Whenever he wanted something, he had to pull it right in front of him, never hiding his rudeness.

 

If he were someone who understood such things, he wouldn’t have put her in such trouble in the first place. This method had been ingrained in Ulrich since childhood.

 

“Lisbell, your hair is tangled again.”

 

Ulrich, who was hugging her warmly from behind, buried his face in Lisbell’s ashen hair, tickling her skin.

 

“It tangles so easily.”

 



 

“Is it because it’s thin and wavy…”

 

He pointed out her flaws, but his actions were contrary. He swayed his face leisurely as if enjoying something pleasant.

 

Lisbell closed her eyes, ignoring his warm breath on the back of her head. She wanted to fall asleep like this, but she was bothered by Ulrich constantly stroking her flat lower abdomen with his broad palm. She had an uneasy feeling that it would soon change its demeanor and threaten her.

 

“Do you know the large farm in Crimpford?”

 

So, she couldn’t easily fall asleep, and Ulrich suddenly asked. Lisbell didn’t answer. It seemed he wasn’t expecting a reply as he continued nonchalantly.

 

“When I was a child, my father took me there to broaden my horizons.”

 



 

“I didn’t expect much, but the farm’s scale was impressive. The green fields stretched endlessly to the horizon.”

 

Her head felt heavy and dizzy. Could a single sip of whiskey make her drunk? Lisbell curled up inwardly. Ulrich persistently stuck to the back of her head, following her like a caterpillar. Occasionally, he stretched out his arms and pulled her curly hair.

 

“While my father was meeting the farm owner, I wandered around, exploring the outdoors. Do you know what amazed me the most?”

 

I don’t know.

 

And I don’t want to.

 

One sip had made her mind feel loose, while this man’s pronunciation and speech were perfectly intact. Was this rambling a drunken behavior? I don’t know. I just don’t want to know.

 

“It was the cotton field. It was a hot season like now, and the cotton bolls were in full bloom.”

 



 

“The white bolls looked as if snow had fallen in summer.”

 

What he said kept reminding her of someone, making it harder to kill her consciousness.

 

Theodore, who was born as the son of a textile factory owner. He, too, often talked about the farms and cotton fields in his hometown, just like Ulrich was doing now.

 

Thinking of Theodore while being entwined naked with another man on the bed made her feel disgusted with herself.

 

“Lisbell’s hair feels like the cotton bolls I held then.”

 



 

“It’s a cute texture…”

 

The slight intoxication and the heavy drowsiness combined, and her mind was completely dazed. She wished the sound would slowly fade, but unfortunately, everything was clearly audible. It was exhausting.

 

The words she just heard were something Theodore had once said.

 

He had told her that her naturally curly hair often tangled and was annoying to manage, but he found it cute like a cloud. Her fiancé had once uttered such ticklish words.

 

Now, hearing Ulrich dirty those words Theodore had once said, while mentioning things that reminded her of Theodore, made her feel cursed.

 

Her loosening mind gradually lost strength.

 

Just before falling asleep, she envisioned Theodore’s radiant smile towards her like the sun. In her fading consciousness, she ran into his arms.

 

A mirage-like sensation that would disappear the moment she grasped it.

 



 

Swoosh-

 

Twisting both ends of a soaked towel, water droplets fell refreshingly. Lisbell, who watched it silently, folded the towel twice, leaving it with just enough moisture. Then, she carefully wiped her mother’s arm that was sticking out from under the blanket.

 

If only her mother’s eyelids would flutter even once, she would have no more wishes, but her mother’s face remained as serene as always, continuing her quiet sleep.

 

After the surgery, Mrs. Osborne had been transported to this villa the moment Lisbell signed the contract. Now, in this cozy bedroom, she received lavish care beyond their means.

 

Under normal circumstances, such expensive medicine being administered morning and night, and the personal physician of the Altahart family coming to Marnia to check on her daily, would be unimaginable.

 

But even in such a perfect environment, her mother showed no sign of waking up. Lisbell’s days passed by caring for her mother. Except for the times when Ulrich summoned her to his bedroom, she spent all her time here.



Lisbell stared blankly at her mother, who lay as if only her body remained, devoid of her soul.

 

“…Mother.”

 

Knowing there would be no response, she still opened her mouth. Her parched and cracked voice, a testament to her broken expectations, echoed in the beautiful yet desolate room before fading away.

 

Lisbell hesitated again as she moved her hand, which had paused for a moment.

 

Why didn’t you tell me?

 

If her mother were to regain consciousness, that was the first question she wanted to ask. It simmered with many emotions.

 

There was guilt for not recognizing the condition of her only family member, relief that her mother had survived in some way, and, on the other hand… a thinly veiled question of why her mother hadn’t informed her earlier, leaving her to be caught like a hostage in a man’s grasp.

 

Lisbell, lost in thought, shook her head.

 

The strange thoughts made her shrink back. Almost scolding herself, she diligently continued to clean her mother’s body.

 

Her mother’s frame, usually hidden beneath clothes, was emaciated. It was like a fragile straw that couldn’t withstand the harsh winter winds.

 

Lisbell bit the inside of her cheek and quickly pulled down her mother’s dress.

 

After making a round of the bed to clean her mother, she sat back in the chair. She hung the now dry towel over the basin and picked up a book she had taken from the study.

 

Opening to the page she had left off, she cleared her throat. She worried that her hoarse voice from the previous night’s distress might sound unpleasant to her mother.

 

Even though her mother was unconscious, Lisbell wanted her to know she was there, so she always read aloud quietly. Today was no different. Her slightly husky voice filled the silent room like a constant background noise.

 

She was about to turn a page full of lines of text.

 

Late summer wind blew through the open window. Her loose ash-gray hair swayed gently.

 

Lisbell lifted her eyes from the book.

 

The midday sun blazed fiercely in the sky. At such moments, Lisbell often felt dazed. She was engulfed in thoughts, wondering what she was doing in such a peaceful scene.

 

Really, what am I doing now?

 

Although she was sitting upright, it felt like she was faltering like someone who had lost their balance. As she realized that the previously stifling hot wind of Marnia no longer felt so intense, she felt more disoriented.

 

The realization that the summer she had once eagerly awaited was passing by so meaninglessly deepened this feeling.

 

Knock, knock.

 

An unexpected knock approached like an unwelcome guest.

 

Lisbell hurriedly turned to the door. Ulrich, whose appearance she hadn’t noticed, was leaning against the door with his arms crossed.

 

It felt strangely surreal for him to be in her mother’s bedroom. During the week she spent caring for her mother, he had never shown his face here.

 

She didn’t know the reason, but she was just grateful. She no longer wanted to be in the same space with him and her mother. The frustration from the hospital room, which had been so brightly lit that she felt even more insignificant, still lingered deeply within her.

 

“You were here.”

 

His tone was monotonous, as if it were obvious she was there.

 

Lisbell closed the book and stood up. Even though he hadn’t completely entered the room, it felt uncomfortable for the three of them to be together.

 

“You have a visitor, Lisbell.”
