 

There was no reason to return, no excuse to.

 

So this would likely be the last time she’d see it…

 

She regretted not leaving a short note.

 

Theodoree, who had no idea of what had happened early in the morning, would surely be shocked when he realized she was gone. With his delicate and kind nature, his mind would be filled with worries.

 

Lisbell bit her lip tightly, turning away. She barely managed to swallow the sob that threatened to rise in her throat.

 

Then, a small, bitter laugh escaped.

 

When had her feelings for him become so full of regret?

 

Gradually, the laugh subsided, and Lisbell took slow steps toward the direction of the farm.

 

She resisted the urge to turn around repeatedly.

 

Revisiting the wounds she had given him, recalling the words of the person who had been by his side, reflecting on them, and engraving them deep in her bones… This was the farewell that had required such relentless effort.


Lisbell arrived at the outskirts earlier than expected.

 

There had been a crisis along the way. Without an umbrella, she had ended up completely soaked like a drowned rat, and her body, which hadn’t gotten any proper rest during the night, couldn’t fight off the fatigue that clung to her in waves.

 

Though she had definitely left behind the city with its government buildings and shops, entering the barren wilderness left her feeling confused, not knowing which way to go. It felt as though she had lost her way.

 

She barely managed to find shelter under a large, rounded rock, beneath the wide, light green willow branches, when she spotted a cart slowly approaching in the distance.

 

Thinking it might be someone looking for her, she hid, but it turned out to be a regular hay cart. Once she realized that, she had an odd feeling. This cart might be heading toward the farm she was after.

 

So, taking advantage of the driver’s distracted moment, she stealthily climbed onto the back. How many times had she done this, sneaking a ride? Lisbell smiled wryly as she hid behind the haystacks piled high.

 

As expected, the cart smoothly headed toward the outskirts. During the journey, the rain that had fallen all morning stopped. When she saw the large fields stretching out before a farm, Lisbell quietly got off the cart.

 

The harbor was much closer to the farm than she had expected. Standing on the hill where she could see the farm, she could even spot the harbor in the distance—so close that it could almost be considered next door.

 

Even from here, the bustling atmosphere of the harbor surged toward her, waking her senses. The long pier, the ships docked there, the many merchants, and the rows of shops were visible.

 

The scale of the harbor was larger than she had anticipated.

 

In a corner, people had gathered in a noisy auction, shouting at the top of their lungs, while several sailors moved briskly between the large ships and the harbor in preparation for the imminent departure.

 

Above, the clear sky had opened up, and seagulls, with wings spread wide, flew freely. Cats with tricolor fur, drawn by the scent of fish, darted around nimbly.

 

The lively atmosphere, as bustling as a market, was certainly a perfect place for someone to hide.

 

Lisbell lowered the brim of her cloche, which she had previously lifted, and approached the harbor.

 

She was hoping to do something about her wet clothes and was fortunate to find a clothing shop among the row of stores. Although she wanted to change into a blouse and skirt, her purse was tight, so she decided to save as much as possible and only exchanged her cape for a new one.

 

Standing in front of a mirror, she lifted the cloche, but despite the hat, her hair, already a tangled mess, could not be salvaged. She tried to comb through it with her hands, but the more she touched it, the worse it got. Eventually, it became so tangled that she couldn’t even brush it properly. Lisbell sighed as she looked down at the mass of hair in her hands.

 

“Lisbell’s hair is just like the cotton blossoms I held back then.”

 

“Should I call it a cute feeling…?”

 

She couldn’t help but recall the actions of the man who had always touched, combed, and even bitten her hair, as if he really liked it.

 

When Theodore said those things, they had come across as warm as sunlight, but when Ulrich spoke them, they felt utterly ridiculous, turning into an offensive insult that left her feeling deeply displeased. Her face scrunched up, as though she had swallowed muddy water, and Lisbell hurriedly untangled her hair.

 

She quickly finished fixing her hair before anyone could notice and pulled her hat back on. Unlike before, this time she rolled her long hair into a neat coil inside the hat, tucking in the stray strands.

 

After a brief greeting, she stepped outside.

 

The afternoon light, gentle and slow like a breeze, streamed down from the clear sky after the rain. It was hard to imagine the violent storm and thunderclaps of the early morning.

 

The harbor was full of curious onlookers. Even those not intending to take a boat seemed to have come to see the lively atmosphere firsthand. Blending in among the crowd, Lisbell managed to buy a ticket for the boat heading toward the country with the monastery.

 

There were still two hours until departure.

 

To kill time, Lisbell went in search of a crowded tavern to grab a meal. The inside of the tavern was dim, relying only on a few lamps to light the space.

 

A few sailors in dark blue uniforms were gathered in one corner, playing darts, while some other customers were sitting opposite each other, puffing smoke from their cigarettes and playing poker, laughing.

 

Lisbell, sticking to the wall to avoid them, sat down at a table closer to the bar and ordered a simple meal and drink.

 

Lisbell had been worried about getting asked questions, but it seemed the staff had encountered travelers like her before and didn’t show much interest. From the way customers were ordering more food, it seemed there wasn’t much time to spare for single diners. This allowed Lisbell to breathe a sigh of relief.

 

Although she had no appetite, she forced herself to eat the ordered food. Occasionally, when the food got stuck in her throat, she washed it down with water.

 

Then, suddenly, she sensed movement at a table behind her, which startled her. Reining in her stomach, which had nearly turned over, Lisbell gripped the handle of her bag tightly. She was ready to leave the shop at a moment’s notice.

 

But luckily, it seemed they were customers of the harbor, as they loudly called the staff over to place their orders. Lisbell, who had been paying attention, subtly diverted her focus and continued eating her remaining food.

 

“Damn it. The sole of my shoe’s all soggy. I must’ve stepped into a puddle up ahead.”

 

“Should’ve been more careful.”

 

“Did I know this would happen? What am I supposed to do when the car can’t come this far in? Damn it, why is there such sudden street control? And with all that military force being mobilized.”

 

Lisbell’s brief sense of calm didn’t last. The fork she had been holding fell from her mouth. Her attention quietly shifted back to the table behind her.

 

“Seems like there’s some dispute among the high-ups, huh?”

 

“No, no. I heard they’re looking for a woman.”

 

“A woman?”

 

“Yes. I saw some soldiers grabbing the shoulders of every woman who passed by, checking their faces.”

 

The food that had gone down her throat seemed to twist in her stomach. Lisbell, trying to suppress her nausea, gulped down some cold water.

 

“What? Is that true? Ha, wow. If it is, they’re really wasting manpower! Which woman managed to sneak off with some bigwig’s back and run away?”

 

Lisbell wanted to observe the situation with the same detached amusement as them, but there was something unsettling that made it impossible for her to laugh. Instead of amusement, cold sweat began to trickle down her back.

 

Control. Soldiers. Women. Faces….

 

Lisbell calmly packed her bag and stood up.

 

“From the way they’re searching every shop like rats, maybe it’s true.”

 

“Do you think this shop might get a surprise inspection too?”

 

“Could be. I heard soldiers were right by the side of the shop.”

 

Her steps, which had been heading directly for the exit, stopped because of those words. Lisbell quietly watched the sailors at the entrance tossing colorful darts.

 

A moment later, through the open door, she saw a shadow moving, like the edge of a swamp, swaying. A sharp instinct hit the top of her head. The air felt ominous. She immediately turned her body and moved back toward the inner part of the shop, away from the entrance.

 

When she was about to open the warehouse door she had seen the staff go in and out of earlier, a commotion erupted behind her. While the shop had been noisy throughout, this felt different.

 

In fact, if you measured by sound, the shop had become eerily quiet.

 

She could sense all attention in the room focused in one direction, and it reached her even at the back of her head. As she turned to close the warehouse door, she caught a glimpse of the shopkeeper, who had been standing inside near the long bar, rushing toward the door while shouting, “What’s going on?!”

 

Click…

 

She quietly shut the door and turned the lock.

 

Her heart was pounding fiercely.

 

The frantic beats of her heart, no longer hidden by the rain, surged within her chest, tightening their grip. Lisbell leaned her forehead against the door, her expression pained. Her stomach had become so cold that she felt like the food she had just eaten might crawl back up her throat.

 

Please, please.

 

She silently prayed to the unseen force behind the door.

 

You have been indifferent to me until now. So please, just this once… Please, let me not be discovered. Hide me.

 

Her desperate plea went unanswered.

 

The sound of heavy footsteps entering the shop filled the air, like the approach of an inevitable despair.


The salty smell wafting from afar was revolting.

 

Was it the scent of the sea, the harbor, or perhaps… escape?

 

Ulrich’s lazily closed eyelids lifted. His pale grayish-blue irises, framed by elegant lashes, reflected the vast expanse of the sea stretched before him.

 

Perched on a wooden cargo crate, he stared at the distant horizon, looking like a man on the verge of dozing off. Everyone wandering around the controlled inner harbor stole a glance at him at least once.

 

It was inevitable. His appearance had a captivating pull that was hard to resist. His bespoke shirt and pants were tailored perfectly to his frame, but the lack of a tie and vest, with a few buttons casually undone, exuded a freedom that enhanced his mystique amid the balance of order and chaos.

 

Even his posture, gazing pensively at the horizon as though lost in deep thought, contributed to the allure. The crimson hues of the setting sun danced around him, enhancing his beauty. The undying brilliance of nature seemed to exist solely for him.

 

Faced with such radiance, Ulrich closed his eyes again.

 

Thump, thump, thump.

 

The pounding in his chest grew more intense.

 

This was a first—something entirely unfamiliar.

 

It wasn’t just this strange inner turmoil. His hands and toes tingled, as if swept by an electric current, and without realizing it, he kept clenching and unclenching his hands, while his toes fidgeted restlessly.

 

What was this?

 

He’d get her eventually.

 

She would inevitably fall into his hands, yet this inexplicable unease lingered, as if things wouldn’t go his way.

 

It was so close now.

 

The lead from Kings Morgan Station had long been acted upon, and the area was under control. Finding nothing there had expanded the search area to this harbor near the outskirts.

 

She would only have confided in Theodore Mortier, the one person she had deep ties with in this region. If she’d learned of his circumstances, she likely would have been unable to restrain herself and fled here.

 

Other than him, there was no other connection she could rely on in Renbruck. Thus, she would likely try to leave Renbruck, and to do so, she would have to pass through either the train station or the harbor.

 

If not caught at the station, she must be here.

 

And if not here, the next step would be to comb through all of Renbruck to find her. To prevent any interference, he had personally silenced his mother by acquiring the massive Pyrilleo Mines at an astronomical price.

 

Yet still, his nerves remained unsettled.

 



 

Ulrich reached into his pocket, retrieving a gold case. He opened it to pull out a cigarette, then clamped it between his lips. The sharp sound of the case snapping shut echoed unnaturally in the stillness around him.

 

He idly bit the cigarette, scanning the harbor bathed in the glow of the setting sun.

 

A slow smile spread across his lips.

 

Yes, the unexpected variable had been failing to catch her at the train station.

 

Lisbell Osborne had undoubtedly been present when the call connected. Ulrich had already pinpointed her location through his informant before arriving in Renbruck.

 

Kings Morgan Station didn’t operate at night, and he had planned to arrive before dawn. Naturally, she should’ve been in his grasp by now. But somehow, Lisbell had evaded the eyes stationed around the station and slipped away with unnerving composure.

 

“Like a frightened cat, sneaking so delicately…”

 

He tilted his head and chuckled softly, his tongue curling in amusement. He almost wanted to laugh out loud, clutching his stomach. The platinum-blond hair falling to one side glistened under the natural light.

 

“Young master.”

 

Victor, who had momentarily stepped away for urgent business, returned with a scowl. Ulrich immediately understood the source of his reaction.

 

“I’m not going to light it, so stop glaring at me like that.”

 



 

“I just needed something to bite on.”

 

It was an excuse, but Victor didn’t seem satisfied. He glanced around, checking the surroundings for reporters who might have followed them.

 

There was no need for such caution. Anyone intent on following would’ve already done so.

 

Amused by the unnecessary worry, Ulrich bit the tip of his cigarette.

 

The Ulrich family had a strict policy against smoking outdoors, fearing the risk of being photographed by reporters. Similarly, except for a light pre-meal drink, they refrained from consuming alcohol in public.

 

For a businessman, public image was everything. It played a significant role in securing large investments or being introduced to influential opportunities. In a society where every aspect of one’s behavior could ripple through the business world, appearances were managed with the utmost care.

 

And Ulrich had never once crossed that boundary before.

 

Yet now, unable to endure this brief waiting, he had taken out a cigarette. Victor glanced around the harbor with a heavy heart. Thanks to the well-placed bribes over time, Colonel Craxson had readily lent his troops within half a day of the request. The soldiers dressed in Rechem military uniforms wandering around the harbor, inspecting the faces of women, were the manpower mobilized for this operation.

 

“My stomach feels unsettled.”

 

“Excuse me? Your stomach? How so? Is it serious?”

 

Victor’s immediate reaction to the monotone remark was exaggerated.

 

“No…”

 

He felt uneasy. Uncomfortable.

 

Ulrich knew well that this wasn’t a physical ailment. That knowledge made him say no more, clenching the cigarette between his teeth. The bitter taste spreading across his tongue mirrored his inner turmoil.

 

Far off, the half-disc of the sun burned on the horizon. He had only looked away for a moment, but in that time, it had sunk a little further below.

 

Bit by bit. Slowly. Like an invasion. Like erosion.

 

Anxiety.

 

What was creeping into him, unsettling his core, was anxiety.

 

It had been so long since he last felt it that its presence was unfamiliar.

 

Anxiety. A sense of crisis. Restlessness. Fear.

 

When was the last time he’d endured the messy, clawing sensation of such emotions? Ironically, Ulrich’s life had been stripped of these feelings, and with them, the dynamic pleasures of existence had been lost at the root. On the other hand, now that the fierce throb of his heart was vividly resonating within him, he had no sense of how time was passing.

 

Every day since Lisbell had been taken from him had been like this.

 

Handling what needed to be handled, organizing what needed to be organized- somehow, today had arrived. He couldn’t even fathom how he had managed to gather information on Daphne Schwaben, annul the engagement with her, and leave a thread of leverage over his mother.

 

His memory of how he had come this far was blurred.

 

In the process, there had been no room to feel the boredom that had clung to his life like a shadow. He had simply been… busy.

 

Before meeting Lisbell, the years, weeks, days, minutes, and seconds had dragged on endlessly, filled with nothing but monotony. It was so dull that he had wondered if the thirty-year mark he had set as the goal for his life’s end might never arrive.

 

But for the past few days, it was as though his life had finally found its rhythm. Time, once incomprehensibly slow, had flown by unnoticed until today.

 

And all his desire centered on one thing.

 

How to bring her back to his side.

 

Truly…

 

When did it begin?

 

When had he stopped feeling the ennui that had so relentlessly eroded his life?

 

“Victor.”

 

“Yes?”

 

“Isn’t it blinding?”

 

“Excuse me? Oh, uh, yes. The sunset is bright.”

 

No.

 

That was not it, Victor.

 

Dropping his cigarette, he clasped his mouth and chuckled, unable to suppress it. A low, stifled laugh escaped him.

 

“I think I finally understand.”

 

“Understand what?”

 

The vivid red light of the sunset blanketed Ulrich’s azure eyes.

 

“You… have never loved someone, have you?”

 

Perhaps this is what you meant when you spoke of love.  

 

These past days, my mind, obsessively preoccupied to the point of suffocation, has plunged into the madness of incomprehension, and perhaps that’s why I’ve ended up like this.

 

But even that raised a question.

 

Why?

 

How can one person’s perspective change so completely, so suddenly?

 

The reality of an emotion I had never felt any fondness for now seems to clear my mind, leaving me strangely relieved. I had dismissed this sensation as petty and insignificant, but—

 

If not this, how else can I explain the sudden disappearance of the ennui that had long drawn me to the edge of death?

 

I must have been enjoying it all along.

 

This unease, this deep, overwhelming, and distasteful pounding, this urgency devoid of leisure.

 

Even if it’s a chilling experience, I must have been enjoying it.

 

If the light Lisbell always clung to, trusted, and relied upon is something akin to this sunset… or this realization that strikes so fiercely, so brilliantly, with a hope close to defiant resolve—

 

If this is what love is… 

 

Ulrich’s blue, no, crimson-stained eyes burned with an intense gleam. They seemed to blaze like a living inferno, magnificent and unstoppable.

“How far along is the search?”

 

Victor suddenly spoke up.

 

Ulrich, feigning calm, easily caught the impatience subtly laced in his tone.

 

He turned to look at his assistant, but the latter was solely focused on Captain Reagan, who had been assigned to oversee this search by the colonel’s orders. Even in his gaze, a hint of unease was evident… something rarely seen from Victor, who was typically unshakably composed.

 

Ulrich recalled the urgent message Victor had just received.

 

“We’ve completed the auction house and shipyard inspections and are now combing through the marketplace.”

 

“How much longer will it take?”

 

“If we find anything in the marketplace, it will end quickly. But if we don’t… we’ll have to move on to the ship area. If it comes to that, it’ll take significantly more time. Every hidden compartment on every vessel will need to be searched. It could take all night.”

 

Captain Reagan explained calmly, but Victor’s expression remained grim.

 

“Victor.”

 

“Yes.”

 

“What’s going on?”

 

“Excuse me?”

 

“There’s a problem, isn’t there?”

 

Victor’s face momentarily faltered, betraying him. It was clear that he could no longer hide the truth. Sighing, he approached Ulrich, who was seated on a wooden crate, and leaned down to whisper.

 

“A message came from the main house.”

 



 

“They’ve issued a summons.”

 

Ulrich’s thin lips curved faintly.

 

A summons?

 

Even during his time in Marnia, this had never happened. A summons was essentially a red alert, a move that reflected both desperation and urgency. That it was being issued now, in this critical moment when Lisbell Osborne was within reach, was a direct message from his mother about how critical the situation had become.

 

But still—a summons?

 

This was a power reserved exclusively for the head of the family, used only against traitors who posed a threat to the household. To invoke it now was a clear indication of how high the stakes were.

 

It was both a measure to protect herself and a declaration of intent to forcibly strip Ulrich of his authority. His mother was determined to prevent this encounter at any cost.

 

“…Ha.”

 

Leaning back, Ulrich exhaled deeply. The long-repressed urge to smoke crept up like a stubborn mold. Running his hand over his face, he looked every bit like a man on the verge of exhaustion. A wry, bitter smile slipped through his features, revealing hints of frustration and disdain.

 

“What should we do?”

 

“What’s the penalty for disobedience?”

 

“The hotel management rights.”

 

“How excessive. Who do you think built the hotel into what it is today?”

 

The Alstad Hotel was one of Ulrich’s crowning achievements. For her to threaten to confiscate it in order to stop him was absurd.

 

At this point, it was almost petty.

 

The situation reeked of stubborn pride—an unwillingness to let things spiral further but also a desperate attempt to salvage her own dignity, no matter how broken.

 

“If you want to defend the management rights, you’ll need to leave immediately.”

 



 

“Sir.”

 

Ulrich’s gaze shifted upward. A lone white seagull cried out as it soared toward the blazing sun, its flight resembling an act of self-sacrifice.

 

Such outdated rules.

 

He had never felt resentment toward the family’s ways before, but now they grated on him.

 

Yet, even so, Ulrich welcomed it.

 

The things that had once seemed hollow and emotionless were now shifting, taking on new meaning. It was all because of her. Lisbell.

 

This change was unfamiliar but exhilarating. He found himself curious—how far would this newfound sensation take him? A quiet, bittersweet desire stirred within him to keep her as an eternal mystery in his heart.

 

“You can’t lose this, sir. You poured everything into bringing the chain strategy from paper to reality.”

 

Victor, standing beside him, was worried solely about the hotel. But Ulrich’s thoughts were elsewhere.

 

He silently watched the soldiers led by Colonel Crackson scour the marketplace.

 

Even if they found her here and brought her back to the estate…

 

Would it solve anything?

 

No.

 

His mother, the pillar of the family, still stood unyielding. Even after shattering his engagement to the Schwaben family to demonstrate his lack of commitment to that relationship, his mother showed no signs of backing down.

 

Taking Lisbell to the estate would lead to the same cycle all over again.

 

“…It’ll just repeat itself.”

 

“In a similar, or perhaps even more maddening, manner.”

 

That was not the result he wanted. Returning with Lisbell under such circumstances would be akin to indulging in foolish stubbornness. It was a pointless endeavor—why initiate something when the outcome was already so predictable?

 

“…Sir?”

 

Victor raised his head to follow Ulrich, who had risen from the wooden crate.

 

Ulrich brushed back his hair, which swayed in the sea breeze. His eyes, fixed on the far-stretching ocean, had darkened to a deeper crimson hue than before.

 

“Call for a retreat.”

 

“Excuse me?”

 

“Let’s head back.”

 

Victor, momentarily stunned, quickly signaled to the captain. The captain, who had been observing the scene with quiet attention, gave simple hand signals to the subordinates standing farther away.

 

Even as this unfolded, Ulrich’s gaze remained locked on the marketplace, where soldiers in uniform bustled about.

 

If she’s there…

 

He wanted to rush over, grab her by the hair, and force her to crawl to him on all fours, sobbing that she’d never try to run again. He wanted to see her fragile, tearful vulnerability as she confessed how hard it had been for her during their time apart.

 

But he knew better than to expect such a sight.

 

She was the type of woman who, even with her resolve repeatedly shattered, always found new light to cling to and hope for. She reminded him of the riotous hues of a dramatic sunset—something that instinctively made him frown yet captivated him nonetheless.

 

His heart pounded relentlessly in his chest, an almost unpleasantly intense rhythm that wouldn’t subside. The thought of turning away from what might be the embodiment of all his whims left him deeply dissatisfied.

 

As he finally turned, he spoke to Victor.

 

“The shareholder rights I inherited from the late Gwen—how much are they worth?”

 

“…Pardon?”

 

“If combined with mine, how much would that make?”

 

“Uh… What? Sir, why are you suddenly—”

 

Victor, caught off guard, instinctively reached for his notebook but couldn’t hide his bewilderment.

 

Ulrich, masking his turbulent emotions with a faint smile, leaned closer and spoke softly to his perplexed aide.

 

“I’m asking how much ownership I need to remove my mother from her position as head of the family.”

 



 

“Hey! Over here!”

 

Bang!

 

Someone kicked the closed warehouse door. Although it wasn’t her body that was struck, Lisbell flinched as if she had been hit herself.

 

“What’s going on?”

 

“The door’s locked.”

 

“Won’t it open?”

 

“Locked from the inside. Someone seems to be holding it shut.”

 

The doorknob began to rattle violently.

 

Voices from outside shouted for the owner and demanded the key to be handed over immediately. The clamor on the other side of the door felt like whiplashes against her nerves. Lisbell, her heart pounding, mustered all her strength to hold the door.

 

Then, the doorknob jiggled. They must have brought the key.

 

No…

 

Lisbell’s eyes welled up with tears.

 

She couldn’t be caught so easily.

 

Frantically, she looked around and spotted a long rod lying in a corner of the warehouse. She quickly let go of the door and grabbed the rod, preparing to strike whoever entered.

 

Her hands, slick with nervous sweat, gripped the rod tightly as she waited. Then, suddenly, the commotion outside came to an abrupt halt.

 

“…What did you say?”

 

“I said retreat!”

 

“What are you talking about?”

 

“We’ve been ordered to withdraw!”

 

“Withdraw?”

 

“Yes!”

 

A small clicking sound of annoyance came from outside, followed by the shadow near the bottom of the door fading away. The heavy, sharp sounds of boots against the ground gradually grew distant.

 

Lisbell watched the scene in a daze, her breath caught in her throat.

 

When the last signs of movement around the door finally disappeared, her trembling hands dropped to her sides.

 

The rod she had been clutching like a lifeline slipped from her grip and rolled into the corner.

 

They were gone…


He just left.

Without opening this door, he simply, simply backed away.

The blood that seemed to have completely drained out through the soles of her feet now finally filled her veins again, as if restoring her once-cold body temperature. Sitting on the spot, Lisbell panted, taking deep breaths.

Tears, which had welled up on her powerless eyelids, streamed down her cheeks.

A beam of light stretched across the narrow storage room. Lisbell followed it with her eyes. Forgotten sunlight shone vividly, as if to restore the warmth of the self she thought had been shattered and broken into pieces.

Rubbing her dazed face with her arm, Lisbell clutched her still-heaving chest, trembling with the aftermath. Taking a deep breath, she placed her hands on the floor to stand up. Grabbing her luggage, she unlocked the door handle.

Carrying the tension that prickled at her throat, she cautiously stepped outside.

As expected, the earlier search commotion had become a hot topic, with people gathered in small groups, chatting animatedly. Fortunately, since the soldiers had searched various shops simultaneously, there wasn’t much attention on this particular storage room. Using their indifference as cover, Lisbell quickly slipped out of the tavern.

Confirming that the group of soldiers in uniform was retreating in the distance, she pulled her hat down low and moved in the opposite direction.

After having a close call with danger, she could no longer roam the shops comfortably. She lingered in the back alleys and corners of the marketplace, enduring until the time for boarding arrived.

Finally, a distant, deep booooom of a ship’s horn echoed.

Oddly enough, there were no further disturbances. The ship, now fully prepared, pulled up its anchor from the depths and spread its white sails wide.

“Departure!”

The booming voice of someone giving the command was accompanied by a whistle that seemed to pierce the heavens. Lisbell watched the gradually receding port of Lenbruck with a gaze filled with suffocating silence.



Saint Alante Monastery was nestled amidst a breathtaking landscape, surrounded by cliffs with endless waterfalls cascading down their rugged faces.

In the age of chaos and disorder marked by ceaseless bloodshed from war, this magnificent cliff had served as a sanctuary for treating patients and hiding people, eventually leading to victory in a long, brutal conflict. It was a place whose sanctity and divinity were proven through history.

The inner chapel, reached after passing through a long corridor, was a cruciform dome carved and modified from rock. Its ornate mosaics and marble decorations along the edges were an indescribable spectacle.

“Miss Osborne, this way.”

Someone called out to Lisbell, who was mesmerized by the serene atmosphere of the chapel, momentarily lost in thought.

Snapping back to reality, she quickly followed the voice.

Since escaping the clutches of Ulrich, divine mercy seemed to have taken a faint hold of her, as things were going surprisingly smoothly.

When she first arrived at the monastery, she was filled with uncertainty. Her mother had lived here, but Lisbell herself had no prior connection to this place.

To come uninvited and ask for help in commemorating her mother’s well-being seemed quite audacious. Even so, clutching guilt and responsibility in either hand, she had barely managed to mention her mother’s name.

Lisbell had even resolved to write to the abbot if direct access was denied. Therefore, being led into the monastery’s premises now felt surreal.

Perhaps it was fortunate that the priest she met at the entrance had been familiar with her mother’s name. At first, there was no reaction to Lisbell Osborne’s introduction. However, upon hearing the name “Helen Osborne” who had once been a nun here, his expression changed subtly, then quickly turned to one of surprise.

“Please wait a moment.”

Politely excusing himself, he had left and returned shortly, informing her that someone wanted to meet her and guiding her into the monastery. It became immediately clear that this was due to traces of her mother’s connection to the place.

“Darien, I’ve brought her.”

The room they arrived at was a small reception room.

The priest stepped aside to let her enter. Lisbell’s gaze naturally shifted to the interior of the reception room.

A person dressed in a white monastic robe with a soft sky-blue veil and a long gold cross hanging from their neck rose slowly to face her. It was clear from their appearance that they were members of the clergy.

“This is Darien, the vice abbot of our monastery.”

The priest explained in a hushed voice. Unsure of how to act, Lisbell hesitated before bowing deeply.

Darien’s calm gaze examined her face intently.

“You look just like Helen.”



“There’s no need to ask further questions.”

Gesturing to the priest with his eyes, Darien motioned to the seat across from him. Lisbell approached and sat down, the sound of the door closing behind the departing priest echoing softly.

The now-silent reception room felt awkwardly still.

That tranquility suddenly felt ominous. While it was true that her mother had once resided here, she had left the place in disgrace after conceiving Lisbell.

After abandoning her aspiration to become a devout servant of God and returning as an apostate, it is uncertain what kind of impression her decision left on the people of this monastery.

If they viewed it negatively…

“…Is Helen doing well?”

Lisbell, who had been staring at the floor uncertainly, suddenly raised her head. She immediately noticed the warmth in Darien’s eyes, akin to the gentle sunlight of spring.

That expression felt as if it reassured her that her decision to come here had been the right one, melting away the tension that had built up within her. Lisbell, her eyes reddened, quickly reached to wipe her face, almost fumbling.

“Well… my mother… passed away recently.”

Her fingers, gripping her luggage, curled inward. Darien was momentarily at a loss for words, then cautiously asked:

“…What happened? Was it an accident?”

“No, it was an illness.”

“I see…”

“Well, that’s part of the reason I came here with a request.”

“A request?”

“Would it be possible to hold my mother’s funeral here?”

“Her funeral hasn’t been held yet?”

“Due to circumstances, we couldn’t conduct the service. And as for her remains… they’re buried in a church near the capital of Rechem.”

“Then why…?”

It seemed he didn’t understand why she was requesting a funeral when the body was already interred.

“I don’t want that place to become the site for remembering my mother. She… didn’t stay in the capital by choice. And I couldn’t properly care for her in her final moments.”



“While she lived with me, my mother often talked about this monastery. She always spoke with such joy and happiness, as though her memories here were incredibly precious. Even though she had to leave because of me, I believe she always carried a longing for this place in her heart.”



“So this place came to mind. If my mother could rest here, I think I, too, would find some peace of mind. I don’t need a grand ceremony for the funeral. A small grave where I can remember her would be enough.”

Lisbell spoke with a voice heavy with tension, barely holding herself together.

“I don’t have her remains to inter, but I do have some personal belongings she left behind.”



“Would that… not be enough?”

Darien, who had remained silent for a while, finally rose from his seat.

“Would you come with me for a moment?”

He led her to a cemetery hidden in the shadow of a sheer cliff, picturesque as if painted.

“This place was once a field hospital during the war. Countless lives lost meaninglessly to the bloodshed of battle were buried here.”



“Now, only those officially affiliated with the monastery or directly connected to its internal affairs may be buried here. That means creating a grave for Helen would be a difficult task.”

So, it was a rejection after all.

Then her attempt at atonement was also…

Her head, heavy with despair, began to droop. But Darien’s next words jolted her back to attention.

“However… I will make it happen.”


“…What?”

Lisbell couldn’t hide her surprise at the unexpected conclusion. Seeing her astonishment, Darien offered a faint smile, as if he completely understood her reaction.

“Helen and I joined the monastery at the same time. On a stormy day, with heavy rain and snow, the two of us were left in baskets at the entrance to this monastery. Perhaps because we were both orphans, knowing neither our parents nor our origins, I’ve always thought of her as my own sister.”

Darien, who had been kneeling in front of a gravestone, slowly stood and turned to face Lisbell. His expression carried the same gentle warmth her mother always showed when reminiscing about the monastery.

“Even though Helen left this place with a child, it doesn’t change how I feel about her.”



“When you walked into the chapel earlier, I felt as though I was seeing a younger version of Helen. I never thought I’d experience such a moment again in my life. It felt like an unexpected, precious gift. Turning you away would leave me with an unforgettable burden.”

“…Is it really possible? Even without my mother’s remains?”

“As I mentioned earlier, this place was once a battlefield. Many of those buried here were interred not with intact remains but with mementos such as dog tags or other belongings, as their bodies were too damaged or missing.”



“If you have Helen’s belongings, that will suffice. The merciful God understands and watches over everything, no matter how it is done.”

A wave of warmth surged through her chest. The knot that had been tied so tightly within her finally began to loosen, as if breaking free. It was a burden that might have weighed on her for the rest of her life if not for this moment.

“Thank you… truly, thank you so much.”

Lisbell bowed deeply, repeatedly expressing her gratitude. Darien lightly patted her shoulder in reassurance.

“Come to think of it, we haven’t introduced ourselves properly. I’m Darien Faye. And you are…?”

“I’m Lisbell Osborne.”

“Osborne.”

Darien repeated the surname, inherited from her mother, with a voice full of vivid nostalgia. Lisbell quickly wiped away her tears with the back of her hand, letting out a deep breath of relief.

Here, it was okay.

She felt she could finally let her mother go in peace.



Darien took charge of all the preparations necessary for the funeral. Thanks to his position as a sub-prior, he managed to streamline many of the formalities that might otherwise have been difficult.

As he had mentioned, Helen wasn’t an officially recognized member of the monastery anymore, so Lisbell had to remain discreet to avoid drawing unnecessary attention.

“Lisbell.”

Standing by the window, gazing at the picturesque view, Lisbell turned at the sound of her name. Darien was standing there, holding a tray of food.

“Am I interrupting your thoughts?”

“No, it’s fine.”

In truth, she had been anxiously watching the horizon, unable to shake the unease that had risen with the morning sun.

It felt as if the monstrous man who haunted her thoughts might storm into the monastery at any moment. But knowing that he would have to cross a vast ocean to reach her eased her fear slightly.

With her mind somewhat calmed, Lisbell clumsily voiced a question that had been buried deep within her amidst the chaos.

“They’ve issued an order to retreat.”

“Retreat?”

The men who had stormed the harbor that day were undoubtedly Ulrich’s soldiers. They had scoured every corner, searching for a woman, blocking roads and rummaging through the marketplace. There was no question they were acting under his orders.

But why the sudden withdrawal?

Whatever the reason, it must have been dictated by Ulrich himself. Perhaps he had decided to give up on finding her. Or maybe something else had happened.

Not knowing what led to her narrow escape frustrated her. While she was lost in thought, Darien appeared.

When she tried to take the tray from him, Darien shook his head and gestured toward the table instead.

“Did you sleep well last night?”

“Yes, very much so. It’s so peaceful here.”

“Being far from the city, it’s naturally quieter.”

“I didn’t expect you to give me a room to stay in. Thank you for your kindness.”

Darien smiled softly as he uncovered the dishes on the tray.

“This room was the one Helen used during her time as a nun.”

“Oh, so it was my mother’s…”

“The lack of new entrants last quarter may be part of the reason, but I’ve also been selfishly trying to keep this room vacant as much as possible. This place holds so many memories for me.”

It was clear that Darien had no problem letting someone stay here for a night, and even more so if that someone was Helen’s daughter, a sharer of those precious memories.

Whenever Lisbell sensed Darien’s goodwill toward her, a quiet warmth spread through her chest.

There was no hidden agenda or malice in Darien’s demeanor, which eased Lisbell’s wariness.

Yet, every time she faced this unfamiliar kindness, something surged up from her core—a hot and aching lump. Lisbell recognized it as the rare warmth of human connection, something she hadn’t felt in a long time. It reminded her of the uncalculated care and generosity she once took for granted when she was with her mother or Theodore.

Indeed, distancing herself from that man had been the right decision.

Only after losing him had she begun to regain what she had unwittingly forfeited. Slowly but surely, the ordinary, everyday moments of life that his suffocating presence had eroded were returning.

She hoped that these fragile fragments of normalcy would continue uninterrupted.

“After breakfast, let’s head to the cemetery together,” Darien said.

“Is everything ready?”

“Yes. Given the circumstances, only another priest and I will be present. It will be a quiet farewell.”

That was more than enough. The thought of finally being able to pray for her mother’s peace filled Lisbell with resolve as she picked up her cutlery.

After breakfast, Lisbell followed Darien to the cemetery. In a discreet corner where no one would notice, a new gravestone and a small burial pit had been prepared.

“Darien,” called a priest, who had previously guided Lisbell into the monastery grounds. He was holding a rectangular wooden box, and Lisbell immediately knew that it contained her mother’s belongings, which she had entrusted to Darien.

The funeral proceeded simply, with only the two clergy members.

After the box was placed in the ground, soil was gently shoveled over it, filling the pit. A few drops of holy water were sprinkled over the pristine gravestone. The water trickled down, soaking into the earth below. Darien closed his eyes and recited a prayer, pledging peace and farewell.

Unlike the one-sided goodbye at the Portley Church, this truly felt like a proper farewell for her mother.

Yet, as Lisbell watched the process, a complex emotion overcame her.

She felt a lightness, as if a burden she had carried for so long had finally been lifted, but there was also a deep sorrow. It struck her that this was the process of truly becoming alone.

Even though her guilt had been a heavy weight, it had also been a strange source of comfort—keeping her mother alive in her thoughts.

But now, with everything laid to rest, she realized that neither Theodore nor her mother remained by her side.

She was alone.

Completely and utterly alone.

Being alone meant being treated as an outsider no matter where she went. That was what her life would be from now on. Though she hadn’t yet faced such a situation directly, the thought of becoming a solitary wanderer left her feeling hollow.

“Where will you go now? Back to your hometown?”

It was as if Darien had sensed her loneliness. Lisbell hesitated before slowly shaking her head.

“No. I’m not going back to Reckem.”

“Then…?”

“…I don’t know.”



“Where should I go?”

Darien’s expression turned curious. She didn’t know the full story, so it was natural for her to find Lisbell’s aimlessness odd.

But Lisbell truly felt lost. She muttered almost as if she were leaning on the God she believed in.

“There was someone I loved… but I hurt him deeply, and we parted ways. My mother is no longer here either.”



“So… I don’t even know what’s left for me anymore.”

“…Lisbell. Do you have nowhere to go?”

Lisbell blinked slowly, her eyelids trembling with a dull ache each time they closed.

She felt relief, but also unease.

Everyone said the world was vast, but that didn’t seem to apply to her.

Why was it that she had nowhere to go?

“If that’s the case, have you ever considered joining the monastery?”

“…What?”

“As a nun, here in this monastery.”

For a moment, she thought it was just an impulsive suggestion meant to console her. But when their eyes met, she saw that Darien’s offer was genuine. Her gaze locked with his steady, unyielding eyes, and she spoke without thinking.

“…How much can religion truly protect me?”


“What do you mean by ‘protect’?”

“I mean, if someone tried to forcibly take me away from here, would it be possible to stop them?”

A profound expression crossed Darian’s face as she studied Lisbell’s features, as though trying to discern the underlying unease behind her words.

“…I’m not entirely sure what specific situation you’re referring to, but once someone is admitted into the monastery, they’re protected by the vow of lifelong devotion. Unless they choose to break that vow or renounce their faith, no one can easily interfere with them. It’s akin to a religious oath. In this country, such autonomy is inviolable.”

Before meeting him, Lisbell had lived in a world where such protections seemed a given. A world where rights weren’t so easily crushed by wealth, family influence, or power.

But… the world she had known and this place were different.

Religion, after all, was not a system dictated solely by capital. It was a sanctuary of miracles and divine intervention, a refuge where even the unsolvable brought people crawling to their knees before God.

Lisbell reflected on the incident at the harbor marketplace.

When the soldiers had stormed in for an unexpected inspection, only to leave without opening the locked warehouse, she had felt a deep relief. It was as if a slender thread of salvation had come from the very God who had always seemed to turn a blind eye to her.

Perhaps the man’s unpredictable change of behavior back then was divine intervention. Or maybe the capriciousness itself had been God’s hand at work.

What was certain was that whatever light had guided her through those moments had also brought her safely to this place. The warmth of that sensation was so sweet that it tempted her into thinking that maybe this was destiny—a comforting delusion of causality.

After all, if not here, where else could she go?

Even Darian’s current attitude seemed like a stroke of fortune. The way she so readily offered Lisbell a safe haven for no reason other than her connection to her mother wasn’t something to take lightly.

Lisbell wanted to surrender herself to that warmth.

Here, with Darian and in this place that finally let her feel the kindness of humanity again after so long…

Perhaps even this was a testament to God’s mercy.

A sign that He would no longer turn away from her.

How many times had she been crushed, tormented, and imprisoned under the man’s cruel whims, desperately praying for a God who might save her? If this was the fulfillment of that longing, Lisbell could not bring herself to refuse it.

“Could you give me some time to think about it?”

It was a decision that required careful consideration—whether to bind herself to religion for the rest of her life. Darian, seemingly not expecting an immediate answer, nodded in understanding.

Yet, by the time Lisbell returned to her room that evening, she had already made her choice.

For others, the life of a cloistered monk might seem stifling, but for her, that very confinement was a necessity. The restricted scope of movement and the sanctuary’s inviolability would serve as a protective shield.

That night, Lisbell borrowed a pair of scissors from a priest. Standing in front of the mirror, she cut off her waist-length hair. The wavy strands of gray tumbled to the floor, scattering like brittle leaves.

She thought of it as a symbolic act—a ritual of sorts. A way to sever herself from the monster that had thrived on her despair, leaving only its remnants behind.

A silent prayer accompanied the act, a desperate plea for the monster to be sated and finally leave her.



“Bell! Here you are!”

She was staring at the large cross mounted on the altar when she heard the familiar voice, accompanied by the sound of the chapel door opening and closing.

Lisbell turned her gaze toward the speaker, unclasping her hands as she did. Standing there, smiling warmly, was a woman about her age dressed in the same attire—a fellow nun named Delilah who had joined the monastery last quarter.

“Was it your turn to clean the chapel today?”

When pledging herself to the monastery, Lisbell had been given the option to choose a name. Most chose a baptismal name instead of their given name, and Lisbell had done the same. “Bell” was the baptismal name she had received through Darian. Perhaps because it was derived from the latter part of her original name, it didn’t feel unfamiliar.

“No, it’s Sonya’s turn.”

At Lisbell’s reply, Delilah narrowed her eyes knowingly.

“So you just came here on your own again? I wondered where you disappeared to right after lunch. Do you like the chapel that much?”

Lisbell smiled faintly and walked toward Delilah, glancing back at the altar.

The cross, adorned with a few unwavering candles, reflected refracted light, giving it a soft glow.

Ever since she had stumbled upon this sight, Lisbell had found herself returning to the chapel whenever she had time.

Unlike Delilah or Sonya, her circumstances were different. The silent unease planted within her churned in her stomach like dark, turbulent waters.

But whenever she sat in the calming atmosphere of the chapel and gazed at the large cross, she felt a semblance of peace returning, as though the chaos within her was soothed.

And though that solace was fleeting, it was solace nonetheless.

「To live as one consecrated to God alone.」

Before entering the monastery, the petition vow handed to her by the priest contained that phrase.

Celibacy.

While the term could be open to interpretation depending on the context, Lisbell immediately grasped what it meant in the monastery’s expectations.

It signified a body that had not lost its purity.

The formation process leading up to the lifelong vow was meant to shape an individual into a devout servant of God.

Thus, any external sexual stimuli were strictly denied and deemed corrupt. Lisbell’s mother had been exiled for violating this principle, hadn’t she?

After a brief hesitation, Lisbell signed the document as if nothing were wrong. Almost involuntarily, her mind vehemently rejected the implication.

It was assault. What I lost wasn’t purity but autonomy.

The act with Ulrich wasn’t something that could ever be called intimacy or lovemaking. To attach such words to it felt like a profanation in itself.

She could not, would not, accept that she was defiled by that act. When her thoughts reached that point, it was almost out of sheer defiance that she completed her signature. Matters of such physical nature were deeply private, and as long as she kept silent, no one would find out. With nowhere else to go, Lisbell clung to this loophole to remain in the monastery.

Yet she couldn’t completely ignore the discomfort weighing on her heart.

This was, after all, a promise to God.

The thought that her falsehood might one day be exposed and lead to her being mercilessly cast out haunted her relentlessly.

For that reason, she found herself drawn to the chapel whenever she had the chance. She would stare at the cross, seeking solace and subtly confessing her inner turmoil. It was less a confession and more a self-justification—a desperate bid to ease her conscience. Without such acts, she feared she would be consumed by guilt and despair.

“Let’s go. The afternoon schedule is about to begin.”

Delilah’s voice brought her back to reality. Nodding, Lisbell tore her gaze from the cross and followed her.

“Today, we’re in charge of cleaning the common room.”

Life in the monastery was divided into two main aspects: adapting to the communal environment and studying religious doctrine.

The former required rigorous education in cooperation and responsibility, as living together necessitated shared duties. Cleaning and maintaining the monastery grounds fell into this category. Yesterday, Lisbell and Sonya had spent the morning washing all the bedding from their dormitory.

“Aren’t you coming?”

Although Delilah mentioned the common room, her steps didn’t lead in that direction, prompting Lisbell to react with curiosity. Delilah, who had paused to admire the blossoming white fringe trees heralding spring, shrugged her shoulders.

“They said a guest is visiting today. I thought we should take our time since they might not be finished yet.”

“A guest?”

“Sir Philip.”

Lisbell tilted her head at the mention of the name as she inhaled the faint fragrance of the tree branch Delilah had handed her.

“Sir Philip? Didn’t he visit just last week?”

Seemingly understanding her confusion, Delilah replied in a matter-of-fact tone.

“Yes. Bell, you wouldn’t know this since you’re new, but Sir Philip is a frequent guest here. His family has been devout for generations, and they make substantial donations to the monastery every quarter. He’s practically a treasured patron here.”

Delilah added that such a distinguished guest’s visit shouldn’t be disturbed. Though her explanation was thorough, it didn’t entirely satisfy Lisbell’s curiosity. Something still felt unclear.

“But today isn’t even a day for regular worship,” Lisbell remarked.

What business could an external guest have at the monastery on a non-worship day? Sir Philip’s reason for visiting remained a mystery.

Delilah sighed lightly before continuing.

“He’s here to receive prayers from the priest. Or sometimes to offer them himself.”

“Prayers…?”

“Sir Philip has a young daughter who’s been battling a congenital illness since birth.”

 It was an unexpected story, and it surprised her a little.

“Oh, his daughter…”

“Yes, we only found out recently. From what I heard, the family doctor gave her a terminal diagnosis a long time ago, but Sir Philip’s daughter has lived far beyond the life expectancy the doctor mentioned at the time.”



“Sir Philip seems to consider it a blessing from God, which is why he’s been visiting more frequently than before.”

Lisbell understood. Few people could empathize with the pain of a family’s suffering better than she could. She had carried the burden of guilt and responsibility like a stain ingrained in her, unable to let go of it, which had led her to this place. She could completely relate to Sir Philip’s desperate efforts, even to the point of seeking solace in religion.

“Shall we head out now?”

Brushing aside the cluster of white petals that had fallen from the tree branch, Delilah turned toward the common room. When the two of them arrived, the timing seemed perfect, as the door that had been closed moments earlier opened just as they reached it. Straightening her posture and bowing her head, Delilah greeted the departing figures. Lisbell followed suit beside her.

Trailing behind Darian, a stranger’s face caught Lisbell’s eye.

Tall, with a thin and wiry frame. His lips carried a gentle smile, but his complexion was shrouded in a subtle gloom that seeped into every corner of his demeanor. Despite his somber aura, his attire was strikingly elegant and refined.

Lisbell instantly recognized him as Sir Philip, the man with a sickly daughter.

“What brings you here?” Darian asked, turning to the two of them. Delilah responded politely.

“Bell and I are assigned to clean the common room today.”

“I see. This is Sir Philip. Both of you, greet him.”

They bowed courteously, and Sir Philip returned the gesture with the noble smile characteristic of his status. After a brief exchange, he followed Darian and walked away.

Lisbell’s gaze lingered on his retreating figure a little longer than necessary.

“Bell! What are you doing?”

Delilah’s voice snapped her out of her reverie, and she quickly replied, “Coming,” before stepping into the common room. As she walked, Sir Philip’s image floated in her mind.

It was a face that evoked a sharp sense of déjà vu.

It wasn’t a matter of having seen him somewhere before. No, it was the expression itself—one that appeared composed on the surface but was painfully worn and hollow within. It reminded her of someone she had seen in the mirror while caring for her mother in Marnia.

It reminded her of herself, her past self.

She saw in Sir Philip a reflection of who she used to be.

Of course, recognizing this did not mean she could do anything about it. But the flood of raw memories he stirred up brought with it a sense of kinship and empathy, uncovering a wound she thought she had buried under layers of resolve.

Having a sick family member is a heavy burden.

It made perfect sense why Sir Philip visited the monastery so often, enough for the sisters to recognize him. He was clinging to whatever he could for hope, desperate enough to offer even his soul if it meant relief.

Who loves more deeply? A parent for their child, or a child for their parent?

Lisbell dismissed the thought as a pointless question, joining Delilah in cleaning the common room. At the time, she assumed her fleeting encounter with Sir Philip was the end of it.

So when she later found him alone in the chapel, she was taken aback.

It was a time when there were no regular services. Lisbell had never seen anyone else during her quiet visits for reflection. Thus, when she opened the door and noticed an unfamiliar figure seated in the middle of the pews, she froze for a moment.

At first, she didn’t recognize him as Sir Philip. She merely thought he was someone, like her, seeking a fragment of peace.

Then, faint sobbing began to rise, muffled and restrained, but audible nonetheless.

Lisbell, seated a few rows behind him, didn’t need to crane her neck to confirm the source. The man’s once-straight shoulders had slumped, and his upright posture had collapsed. He was crying silently, as if carrying the weight of a deeply personal sorrow. His whispered prayers rippled through the still air of the chapel.

She didn’t need to see his face to know who he was. The image of his melancholic expression from earlier came vividly to mind. Remembering his frequent visits to the monastery erased any doubt.

She could also guess the content of his tearful prayer.

He must be pleading for his daughter’s life.

It was no different from when she clung to each line of scripture, wishing desperately for her mother to open her eyes.

Feeling uneasy, Lisbell stood up earlier than usual, intending to leave him in peace.

But she didn’t make it far before stopping. Hesitating, she reached into her pocket and pulled out a handkerchief she always carried just in case. Weaving between the pews, she cautiously approached him.

As she got closer, she confirmed that it was indeed Sir Philip. So engrossed in his emotions, he didn’t even notice her presence. Lisbell hesitated briefly before opening her mouth to speak gently.

“Um…”

He startled and opened his eyes, which were brimming with tears. The intricate colors of the chapel, refracted through the mosaic windows, illuminated the deep sorrow pooled in his expression.

Lisbell hesitated, unsure of what to say, and ultimately chose to stay silent as she extended the handkerchief.

Sir Philip, clearly taken aback, accepted it with a slightly bewildered look. A moment later, he seemed to realize the gesture was meant to comfort him. Lowering his gaze, he let out a long sigh, heavy with unspoken emotions. Even his breath carried traces of lingering sadness.

“Thank you. I’ve shown you an unsightly side of myself.”

“It’s nothing.”

Using the handkerchief to wipe away the tears on his cheek, Sir Philip glanced at her briefly.

Soon, his gaze shifted, becoming more inquisitive.

“I am Philip Winchester. I’ve been visiting this monastery for many years, but I don’t recall seeing your face before.”

Though they had briefly exchanged greetings earlier, it was likely too fleeting for him to remember her. Lisbell thought it reasonable and responded calmly.

“I recently joined under Lord Darian’s recommendation.”

“And your name is?”

“…Bell.”

When introducing herself, she often found her full name, “Lisbell” almost slipping out. Only after a moment’s pause did she manage to offer the appropriate response.

Sir Philip nodded and fell silent for a moment before asking another question.

“Did you overhear my prayer?”

“No. I only heard… the sound of your sorrowful crying and came to check.”

He gave a faint, bitter smile.

“At my age, crying like this in front of others is hardly dignified. Yet, I can’t seem to help it. Whenever I come before God and speak, it feels as though the reins holding me together unravel completely. I have a sick daughter, you see. Thinking of her feels as though my heart is being torn apart.”

Although she already knew of his circumstances, Lisbell decided it was better to remain quiet and simply listen.

“Bell, you see…”



“I would do anything—absolutely anything—if it meant my daughter could live a better life. If she could go outside, bask in the sunlight, and run freely, I’d give everything I have to make it happen.”



“That’s how desperately I wish for it.”

Lisbell hesitated, her lips moving wordlessly for a few moments before she finally mustered the courage to speak.

“…I understand.”



“My mother was gravely ill as well.”

She refrained from adding that, unlike Sir Philip, she had lacked the power or resources to do anything about it. She couldn’t afford to make significant donations to the monastery, couldn’t frequent this place as if it were her home, or plead with God for a miracle. All she could do was endure, suffering under the whims of the man who loomed over her life, with no means to fight back.

Even though it was now a part of her distant past, the mere memory of it left a bitter taste in her mouth.

“So… I sincerely hope your daughter regains her health.”

He didn’t say anything in response. Concerned that she might have said something wrong, Lisbell carefully studied his expression, but it didn’t seem that way. Rather, it felt as though he was at a loss for words—or perhaps his throat had tightened.

It seemed her words, her shared experience, had resonated with him on a profound level.

This wasn’t mere human sympathy; it was a deep, bone-deep connection born from shared pain.
