She pretended to glance at it casually, then returned her head to its original position. She pressed her cheek against his palm to fully dispel any suspicion.

 

She felt him pause ever so slightly. When he resumed moving his hand, his touch was even gentler than before. He brushed her long eyelashes and softly swept across her eyelids. It felt so tender that it was hard to believe this was the same hand that had strangled her neck and broken her ankle.

 

But it was a memory that could never be erased.

 

No matter how many lives she lived, she would never forget what this hand, and the man attached to it, had done to her.

 

It would remain forever buried deep in her heart, serving as her own private penance.

 



 

For several days, she observed Mrs. Altahart’s movements through the living room window.

 

This time, she realized that from this living room, she could see who was leaving and entering the mansion in real time. By simply opening the curtains, she had a clear view of the fountain in the center of the garden, and every car managed by the household passed by there.

 

So whenever Ulrich left, citing his schedule, she would come down to the living room and stay there.

 

If she wanted to sneak into Mrs. Altahart’s bedroom and find what she was looking for, she needed to understand her routine. She needed to know when the bedroom would be empty.

 

After carefully observing for days while deliberately aggravating the wound on her neck to delay the wedding as much as possible, she realized that Mrs. Altahart always went out on Tuesdays. Sometimes she was accompanied by the man who seemed to be her new lover, and sometimes by her secretary, but in any case, she always left the mansion in a car.

 

While it would be fortunate if she could sneak in unnoticed, she also had to be prepared for the possibility of being caught. For this reason, Lisbell waited for Ulrich to go out as well.

 

She had to be cautious not only of Mrs. Altahart, the owner of the bedroom but also of Ulrich, who would be immediately informed if something went wrong.

 

Rushing could ruin everything. So she cultivated patience, waiting and waiting while deliberately digging her nails into her neck, which was now healed enough to no longer need bandages.

 

Then, on a Monday night, when her patience was nearly at its limit, Ulrich, who had been carefully examining her neck, spoke.

 

“I have to visit a hotel after lunch tomorrow.”

 “…A hotel?”

 

“There’s an art dealer coming. I need to pick out some pieces to hang in the rooms.”

 

Ulrich lifted Lisbell’s slender chin. As he applied ointment to the nape of her neck, more visible under the light, he whispered softly.

 

“Shall we go together?”

 

It was quite an improvement.

 

He was even thinking of taking her out with him. What if she used the opportunity to escape? But on second thought, it also meant that his trust in her had deepened significantly. It was the carelessness that Lisbell had been waiting for.

 

Tomorrow.

 

Tomorrow, when his mother is out and Ulrich is also away, she must stay in the mansion at all costs.

 

“No, I’d rather stay here.”

 

She only hoped her voice sounded natural.

 

“I don’t really know much about art….”

 

Ulrich didn’t respond to her hesitant reply, which she had made in an attempt to sound subtly awkward.

 

In fact, it was he who had first suggested the idea, but she wondered if he actually preferred this kind of answer. Wasn’t he the one who had been so eager to confine her? In this situation where she declared that she would stay of her own accord, wouldn’t he be not just pleased but utterly satisfied?

 

She lowered her gaze to gauge Ulrich’s expression, but before she could, he brought his face close to hers.

 

His light gray eyes, so close that they seemed to merge with the surrounding darkness, glinted dully. It felt as if her heart had plunged into the deep, dark, and murky water. Her pulse slowed, and a slight shiver ran through her. A strange tension tingled across her skin.

 

“It’s fascinating….”

 



 

“That a person can change so much with just a single resolve.”

 

His low voice sounded more like a soliloquy, pondering over an enigma rather than addressing anyone in particular.

 

Then, he lightly nipped at the bridge of her nose. Shocked, she widened her eyes, and into her vision came his face, mischievously smiling.

 

It wasn’t a smile he habitually put on. It was transparent joy, so genuine that it felt as if she was seeing his true self for the first time.

 

And at that moment, she realized.

 

Ah, I’ve been deceived.

 

I let my guard down….

 

Thump, thump. Some emotion kicked violently within her chest. For the first time, Lisbell couldn’t define what she was feeling.

 



 

The next day, after confirming that the car carrying Ulrich’s mother had left from the living room, Lisbell immediately returned to Ulrich’s bedroom.

 

She picked up the bottle of liquor from the table and uncorked it without hesitation. Then, she tilted it over her palm. The liquid, which she would normally pour into her mouth, pooled in her hand like golden fluid. Lisbell rubbed it evenly on her arms, legs, shoulders, and the nape of her neck.

 

After the commotion, the smell of alcohol was so strong that it could sting someone’s nose just by standing near her. If someone found her in an unexpected place, they would surely think it was a mistake due to intoxication.

 

Lisbell set down the bottle, grabbed a waist strap from the closet, and headed to the bathroom. She tied the strap tightly around her waist under her clothes and tucked a dry towel inside it. Then, she left the bedroom.

 

She vaguely remembered where the Madam’s bedroom was. She had followed Ulrich with growing frustration as he searched for Julian Scott. The vase that Ulrich had used to smash Julian’s head was placed on a display cabinet, and the structure of the surrounding furniture made it easy to locate the Madam’s bedroom.

 

Lisbell grabbed the doorknob and looked around. Sensing no signs of anyone nearby, she carefully entered the room.

 

As expected, it was empty. She leaned against the door, scanning the area as she turned the lock. There was a soft click as the door locked from behind her.

 

She took her time waiting to confirm that there was no one inside. Once sure, Lisbell began to thoroughly search every corner of the room. Under the tea table, beneath the sofa, near the bed, on top of the wardrobe, and inside every drawer.

 

But there were too many places to search. The Madam’s bedroom was just as large as Ulrich’s. Moreover, even without the bathroom, the room was divided into several sections like a suite, so every turn presented a new area to inspect.

 

She had heard before that the Madam rarely left her bedroom, and now it made sense. The space was so varied and luxurious that such a reclusive lifestyle seemed entirely feasible.

 

‘The box, the box….’

 

Recalling Julian’s description, Lisbell’s eyes darted around busily.

 

As Julian had described, the Madam’s bedroom was incredibly ornate. It felt like stepping into a meticulously preserved chamber of a palace.

 

Ulrich’s bedroom was also decorated in every corner, but not to this extravagant extent. Just glancing around was enough to make Lisbell feel a heavy weariness.

 

Which made it all the more puzzling. Julian had said the box was plain, not matching the opulence of the bedroom. Shouldn’t something so out of place be immediately noticeable? She felt she had already checked every possible hiding spot.

 

‘It’s not here….’

 

Was it really in here?

 

Lisbell was nearly running around the room in search, her breath catching in her throat. She stood still for a moment, exhaling slowly. She tried to remain calm, but it wasn’t easy, knowing that she had already spent considerable time searching. If she had gone to such lengths, there had to be some reward.

 

She didn’t know what the outcome of today’s events would be, but it might be her last chance to enter the Madam’s bedroom on her own two feet. Biting the inside of her cheek, Lisbell lowered herself to check under the bed once more. The darkness beneath greeted her with an empty stare. Even though it seemed like there was nothing, she kept probing with her arm, moving it around.

 

“…!”

 

The spot she assumed was a wall gave way slightly when she pressed against it.

 

A false wall…?

 

Why would something like this be installed here?

 

Lisbell quickly pulled herself out from under the bed. She headed towards the headboard, pulling back the curtain drawn to block the morning sunlight.

 

What she thought was just a wide bed frame gave way completely when she kicked it, sliding inward like a door.

 

“…It’s here.”

 

Lowering herself almost flat to the ground to confirm, she found a black wooden box. Lisbell grunted as she pulled it out.

 

Finally, when the box was fully visible in front of her, a sigh of relief escaped her lips. The joy of finding what she had so desperately searched for was short-lived. Lisbell hurriedly opened the lid of the box.

 

“…Ah….”

 

Didn’t Julian say it was used to store things too unsightly to be seen? She had expected it to be filled with all sorts of junk, but that wasn’t the case. There were only a few items inside.

 

Even in this dimly lit space, a diamond ring and a pendant with a metal ornament suitable for a child gleamed brightly, and at the very bottom….

 

“It was a special order from one of the few places in the world that produce firearms. A gun with a slide wrapped in pure gold leaf.”

 

There was a black gun adorned with gold leaf patterns on its surface.

 

It’s here.

 

A gun.

 

It’s really here.

 

When she realized that the object she had longed for in her mind had materialized right in front of her, her heart plummeted. Even before she could calm her trembling insides.

 

Click.

 

There was a sound from the direction of the bedroom door.

 

“…Did it work?”

 

“Why is it locked…?”

 

“…What do you mean…? Weren’t they supposed to be out…?”

 

“…Get the key….”

 

From outside, she could hear voices, confused and hurried, as if someone was running down the opposite side of the corridor. The handle rattled as someone tested whether the door was indeed locked.

 

Lisbell snapped to attention. She quickly pulled out the gun and closed the box’s lid. She felt a prickling sense of urgency.

 

As she did when she retrieved it, Lisbell grunted as she pushed the box back behind the bed. She then reached into her clothes, pulled out the towel she had brought, and wrapped the gun in it. She slipped it under her skirt and secured it behind her with the tight waist strap she had tied. As she did, she heard the sound of a key being inserted into the door’s lock. A chill ran down her spine.

 

Lisbell quickly jumped onto the bed. She relaxed her limbs and went limp, assuming the appearance of someone deeply asleep.

 

Moments later, the door opened, and several footsteps hurriedly entered the room. The bustling noise of people checking on the situation came to a stop as they approached the bed.

“Who is this…?”

 

A soft, unfamiliar voice broke the silence. It seemed to be one of the maids.

 

“Sasha, go inform the master.”

 

“Yes, Butler.”

 

A butler? It seemed like the servants had business in the lady’s bedroom, found the door locked, and had called the butler. Lisbell had to suppress even the heartbeat she felt, hiding her anxiety.

 

“What should we do? Should we wake her?”

 

Someone asked hesitantly, wary of getting involved in something troublesome. Before the butler could respond, Lisbell furrowed her brow as if regaining consciousness amid the commotion. Slowly, she opened her eyes.

 

“Miss Osborne, why are you here?”

 

The old butler asked the moment their eyes met. It was a question Lisbell had anticipated, so she replied according to her plan.

 

“Why am I here… Ugh!”

 

She suddenly covered her mouth as if suppressing the urge to vomit. The startled servant approached her, then hesitated. He glanced at the butler and whispered, “She smells of alcohol.” The butler, seemingly understanding the situation, calmly stated,

 

“This is the lady’s bedroom.”

 

“What? What do you mean…? I was in Ulrich’s room…”

 

Feigning drunkenness, Lisbell mumbled, looking around in confusion.

 

“Ah…?”

 

She furrowed her brow, reacting as if realizing something was off. After a brief pause, she held her forehead.

 

“I… drank too much, and it seems I’ve made a mistake.”

 

“Let’s get you up. I’ll escort you to the master’s room.”

 

Lisbell didn’t resist as the servant helped her, making it clear she had no intention of putting up a fight.

 

As she walked towards the door, she felt the butler’s piercing gaze on her back. Her heart pounded in fear that the outline of the gun hidden under the towel might be revealed. However, they left the lady’s bedroom without incident.

 

The servant quickly left after escorting her to Ulrich’s room. Lisbell was more than happy with his lack of interest.

 

Once alone in the bedroom, her previously unsteady steps, mimicking the effects of a hangover, became stable as she entered the bathroom. She quickly crouched down and retrieved the item hidden in her waistband.

 

She unwrapped the towel and carefully examined the gun, which she hadn’t been able to inspect closely in the lady’s bedroom. The weight suggested it was loaded, so there was no need to search for bullets.

 

Suddenly, her vision blurred.

 

Confused, she blinked, but the blurriness persisted.

 

It took her a moment to realize that it wasn’t her vision but her hand holding the gun that was trembling. The weight of the weapon brought back memories of the day she first learned to shoot from a man, recalling the weapon’s deadly power.

 

“…No.”

 

I can’t be scared now.

 

I can’t have regrets.

 

She had come this far, focusing solely on her goal.

 

To give up now would be betraying herself. This was not only her resolve but also an atonement for her mother and revenge for Theodore. The lives he had destroyed were now in her hands.

 

You knew this would happen.

 

You already knew it wouldn’t be easy.

 

You were about to kill someone… ensuring they would never wake up again. It was murder. A crime so severe that the world considered it deserving of the harshest punishment.

 

That’s what she was about to do.

 

“Don’t tremble… don’t tremble…!”

 

She wanted to stop, but her fingers were stiff and unresponsive, cold as if frozen. Lisbell gripped her frozen hand, biting her lip hard enough to draw blood. Even as her conscience, though shattered, whispered incomprehensible words in her ear.

 

If you stop here… what then?

 

“I’ll make you the beautiful bride of spring.”

 

Her bloodshot eyes flicked up to the bathroom mirror. She saw her neck, the bandages removed. Though it had been a long process, the wounds had healed. All that remained was a long scar encircling her neck like a rope. The scar seemed to remind her that time was running out.

 

If you don’t kill him, you’ll have to marry him.

 

You might never be able to leave this place… for the rest of your life.

 

Can you bear that?

 

‘…No.’

 

I can’t.

 

So, she had no choice but to abandon her conscience.

 

If she wanted to avoid withering away, this was the only path.

 

After closing her eyes tightly and reopening them, Lisbell slowly put the gun down. Ironically, it was only then that the trembling stopped and her body obeyed her.

 

She wrapped the gun back in the towel and pushed it under the bathroom cabinet, in the same space where she had hidden the pills given to her by the lady. Since the pills hadn’t been discovered in the past few days, the gun was unlikely to be found soon.

 

Just a little more.

 

Just a little bit longer…

 

Lisbell left the bathroom after ensuring everything was in place. Without the weight of the gun hanging at her waist, her entire body felt lighter. But the intense fatigue that suddenly washed over her felt as though her entire body was being squeezed.

 

She climbed onto the bed, lying down as quietly as a dead person, barely breathing. Eventually, she wasn’t even sure if she was still breathing.

 

Although she was alive, it felt like all her physical functions were being filtered through a fog of consciousness. Her heart, still pounding wildly, seemed the strangest thing of all. As she mulled over it, the fact that she was alive at all seemed the strangest of all. Why was she still alive, enduring all this…?

 

She didn’t know how much time had passed.

 

Her mind only started to clear when she sensed someone outside the door.

 

“Lisbell.”

 

The door opened, and Ulrich entered. She remembered that they had been going to inform him. It seemed he had rushed back after hearing the news from the estate. Lisbell propped herself up on her arms and sat up.

 

“You went to my mother’s bedroom?”

 

“I mistook the rooms…”

 

“You confused this room with hers?”

 

“I had a few drinks… today.”

 

As Ulrich sat on the bed, closing the distance between them, he grabbed a handful of Lisbell’s shortened hair and brought her face closer. His sharp nose brushed her chin and neck. It seemed he could still smell the faint scent of alcohol, as he frowned slightly.

 

“The door to the bedroom was locked. Why did you lock it?”

 

“I don’t know.”

 

“….”

 

“I don’t remember.”

 

“…Has this happened before?”

 

“No.”

 

“First time today?”

 

“Yes.”

 

“You’re not just pretending not to remember?”

 

“I don’t know.”

 

As Lisbell continued to answer indifferently, Ulrich, who had been staring at her, glanced back at the door. There stood the old butler who had followed him in.

 

“Pavel, call the doctor.”

 

“A doctor?”

 

“Now that I think about it, you’ve been drinking too much lately.”

 

Ulrich looked quite serious. Seeing her confuse the bedrooms and forget her actions made him suspect she might be suffering from some alcohol-induced illness.

 

After a short wait, the doctor arrived. He had previously examined Lisbell in this bedroom at the lady’s request. After quickly asking a few questions, the doctor examined various parts of Lisbell’s body. Under Ulrich’s intense gaze, he even carefully inspected the burn on her neck before giving his diagnosis.

 

“There are no severe symptoms yet, so it’s hard to determine it as a disease. However, considering she drinks at least two glasses a day, I advise against alcohol for the time being. Also, Master, may I have a word…?”

 

After giving his standard advice, the doctor stood up and approached Ulrich.

 

Meanwhile, Lisbell stared at the long bottle of alcohol on the side table. She wouldn’t need it anymore. She had only been drinking to soothe the exhaustion she had to endure. After today, she wouldn’t need it anymore…

 

“What?”

 

A loud voice suddenly cut through her thoughts.

 

Lisbell’s head turned toward the sound. At the end of her gaze, Ulrich looked uncharacteristically surprised, unable to hide his shock. He seemed rather taken aback, a rare expression for him.

 

The doctor, who had been speaking to him, asked something in a low voice. Ulrich, lost in thought, finally snapped out of it and brushed his hand over his mouth.

 

“No… let’s keep this quiet for now….”

 

His face slowly turned toward her. At that moment, the sunlight behind him cast a perfect backlight. Half of his handsome face was shadowed, leaving only his lips visible to her.

 

A faint, curved smile…

 

 Lisbell felt uneasy, as if she had seen something unspeakably repulsive. The reason was unclear. Before she could fully grasp it, the fleeting image that lingered like a brief nightmare faded. As Ulrich took a step toward the bed, the darkness that had partially swallowed his face receded, allowing a bright light to seep in. His face, now fully visible, remained as composed as ever.

 

“Don’t worry. From today, I’ll make sure you don’t drink any alcohol,” he said, as if he had never shown a dazed expression. He quickly returned to his usual self, offering a seemingly fabricated smile along with his words.

 

“Has Mother returned?” Ulrich asked the butler, who was still standing there.

 

“Not yet,” the butler replied.

 

“Then let’s keep what happened today a secret.”

 

“But, Master…”

 

“Did you say my fiancée just mistook the room, Pavel?”

 



 

“Anything more would only break my heart.”

 

Although his tone suggested disappointment, there was a strict command hidden within, warning not to cross the line. He implied that he would overlook this incident but not to mention it to the lady of the house.

 

In the current household hierarchy, where the order had been overturned, Ulrich’s commands were absolute. The butler, understanding this, bowed his head and left the bedroom.

 

Lisbell, who had been watching the situation unfold from the bed, flinched when she felt an arm wrap around her waist. Ulrich, who had climbed onto the bed beside her, leaned against her, his small body collapsing backward. Their arms and legs became entangled on the sheets.

 

“There’s nothing to worry about. Mother won’t call you separately to give you a warning.”

 

…Worry?

 

When she raised her eyes, puzzled by his words, Ulrich burrowed into her embrace, his face melting sweetly like honey. He rubbed his face against her meager chest and whispered softly, as if wondering why she was staring at him like that.

 

“Lisbell, your face has gone pale because you’re scared.”

 

It wasn’t true.

 

What she feared wasn’t something as trivial as a scolding.

 

“Don’t worry about anything. Just sleep. When you wake up, we’ll have a meal together. We’ll eat something delicious, and then, maybe… we could go see a play after a long time. Or we could invite an orchestra to the mansion and hold a concert just for you…”

 

He mumbled like a child dreaming of impossible things. Meanwhile, Lisbell, who felt as if she had no more energy left, struggled to raise her hand.

 

She stroked his hair, which rustled near her chest. The smooth texture wound persistently between her fingers, like a man. Soft in form, yet with an intensity that didn’t match.

 

Ah.

 

Soon…

 

Lisbell slowly closed her eyes.

 

She could almost hear the sound of a heartbeat. She couldn’t tell whether it was hers or his, but one of them was a frail pulse that would soon be cut short.

 



 

When she awoke from a brief sleep, the surroundings were dim.

 

No lamps were lit, making the room dark. She felt as if she were trapped in a black forest, unable to see an inch ahead.

 

Lisbell tried to move but hesitated. Her limbs were pinned down, making it difficult to move carelessly. Her heart throbbed reflexively.

 



 

With eyes barely adjusted to the darkness, she realized it wasn’t shackles restraining her but Ulrich’s limbs. They had fallen asleep entwined like this. Ulrich, still asleep, breathed evenly with his eyes closed.

 

How strange.

 

Before falling asleep, her head had been bursting with emotions and thoughts, heavy enough to make her want to tear it off. But now, after waking up, her mind was clear, as if everything had evaporated.

 

All that was left before her was a man sleeping defenselessly.

 

Lisbell, sitting awkwardly, stared at his face. After what seemed like a long time, she calmly removed his arms and legs that were weighing her down. The act felt remarkably serene, almost like a sacred ritual.

 

She got out of bed and stood for a moment before heading toward the bathroom. Crossing the threshold that felt like a boundary, she groped under the bathroom cabinet. The gun was still there.

 

She removed the towel and took it out properly, feeling its weight in her palm. It wasn’t just the weight of the bullets; it was the weight of someone’s life. The realization made her shoulders feel as if they might give out at any moment. Even though she knew it was just an illusion, she couldn’t shake off the heaviness.

 



 

The unlit bedroom was as dark as a night that would leave no trace.

 

Lisbell walked toward the bed with silent steps. She felt as if she were walking through a sea path with endless waves, her breath gradually becoming more labored.

 

She didn’t know how she reached the bed and climbed on top of him. She simply blinked a few times, and it was done. A new, intense sensation pressed down on her neck, which had almost healed. Her breathing became uneven, as her inhales, exhales, and gasps crossed paths erratically.

 

Now was the time.

 

She had to shoot now to end this without any mistakes.

 

So shoot now.

 

Now, now, right now. Now, now!

 

“……!”

 

Her trembling hand was about to pull the trigger when a strong force gripped the gun barrel. Huh. The breath she had been holding slipped from Lisbell’s lips. Desperately, she tightened her sweaty grip on the gun.

 

A pair of blue eyes, now open, were looking up at her.

 

“What is this…?”

 

It was a drowsy voice, as if he had just woken up. Ulrich, who had been lazily blinking his eyelids, seemed to finally grasp the situation, letting out a drawn-out “Ah-” followed by a confused “Huh?”

 

Lisbell bit the inside of her cheek until it bled and pressed the gun firmly against his ribs, just above his lungs.

 

Finally, the strange sound that had been coming from Ulrich’s mouth ceased.

 

His hand was still gripping the gun barrel, but there was no struggle for dominance, as if he had no intention of taking it away. There was only silence, so tense it made her skin tingle and the fine hairs on her body stand on end.

 

“Where did you…”

 

After a moment, he spoke in a languid voice.

 

“I’ve seen this gun before.”

 

“…Let go.”

 

“Oh, I see.”

 

Ulrich let out a lukewarm sigh, as if he had only just realized something.

 

“You went to Mother’s room to find this, didn’t you?”

 

Does he not realize that a gun is pointed at him right now?

 

If not, how can he be so indifferent?

 

Lisbell’s finger was poised to pull the trigger at any moment. Despite his disadvantageous position, lying beneath her, Ulrich showed no signs of fear.

 

Instead, he chuckled softly, as if rolling his tongue inside his cheek. Lisbell felt as if she could no longer tell whether the thing she was pressing down on was a person or a lump of darkness.

 

“…I’m going to shoot.”

 

“When did you plan this?”

 

“I’m… I’m really going to shoot.”

 

“From the beginning?”

 

“So let go. Right now…!”

 

“Was your sweet behavior all an act, then?”

 



 

“Haha. I thought you might have really changed your mind…”

 



 

“I’ve been deceived, haven’t I?”

 

This isn’t right.

 

It wasn’t supposed to be like this.

 

Why was he so calm while she was the one feeling like she was about to lose her mind? The gun was clearly aimed at him, but she felt as if she was the one who was about to shatter. She didn’t understand. She couldn’t understand.

 

Lisbell, determined as if she were about to lose a finger, wedged her index finger into the trigger guard.

 

“Do you think I won’t shoot…? Is that why you’re so calm? Is that it?”

 

If so, she wanted to prove him wrong.

 

She would shoot.

 

She would shoot Ulrich Altahart, and she would dry up the shadow that clung to her ankles and refused to let go.

 

She knew it was an unforgivable act. So she would turn herself in afterward. For now, that was her only sense of freedom.

 

She didn’t care where she ended up. As long as it wasn’t next to this man who had ruined her life. No matter how much freedom she might have by his side, it would be no different from the sun viewed from a prison cell.

 

“If you want to shoot, go ahead.”

 

“…What?”

 

“Where do you want to aim?”

 

Ulrich, who had yet to release the gun, slowly moved his hand.

 

“Chest? Or the stomach?”

 



 

“If you don’t like that, how about the forehead?”

 

To prove he wasn’t joking, he used his own strength to raise Lisbell’s hand, bringing the gun to his forehead.

 Like the sky that indifferently gazes down on the violently surging waves as if it were someone else’s concern, Lisbell felt her sanity crumbling in front of his unnervingly calm demeanor. It was as if her vision wavered, as though she had been struck in the head.

 

She struggled to open her trembling lips, which chattered incessantly.

 

“What… are you doing?”

 



 

“I’m… going to kill you….”

 

I’m really doing this.

 

This isn’t a joke. Do you think my resolve is trivial? Am I that easy to push around? I’m really going to shoot you. Why do you think I can’t? Are you dismissing me as nothing but a weed you’ve trampled on so easily until now, thinking I won’t be able to?

 

“How… how little do you think of me? Do you think I can’t possibly shoot you, so you’re…!”

 

“I know you can shoot.”

 



 

“If I fell for it, that means Lisbell was just as determined.”

 

Lisbell stared down at Ulrich as if she had lost the ability to speak. A growing sense of emptiness quickly filled her.

 

But strangely, it seemed Ulrich felt that emptiness even more. His eyes were strangely hollow, and his expression, drained of any malice, showed no trace of resistance. It was as if he would even let himself be pushed over if someone wanted to topple him.

 

His face, now devoid of all sleep, wore a quiet smile as he calmly moved the gun barrel himself.

 

“You’re going to kill me, right?”

 



 

“Then aim for either the forehead or the heart. Those spots give the highest chance of instant death.”

 

“Why….”

 



 

“Why are you doing this….”

 

“What?”

 

“Why… why are you so calm about it… why…. Why!”

 

Is this person strange, or am I the strange one?

 

Which one of us is strange?

 

Lisbell believed she was the normal one. So the man must be the strange one. Yet, at the same time, he looked so utterly indifferent. With a face that was extremely composed, he looked up at her with eyes as still as the undisturbed surface of the sea, which only served to push Lisbell’s mental state into a corner.

 

Her thoughts, caught in a twisted chaos, flipped, overturned, and spun out of control.

 

This man is strange..

 

Is he not the strange one?

 

Is it me? Am I the strange one?

 

Am I the crazy one?

 

“Hmm, I was quite happy for the past few days.”

 



 

“It was fun, and I even thought a bit about our future together….”

 



 

“So, I must have had some expectations. Otherwise, there’s no way to explain the disappointment I’m feeling now.”

 

That’s why she couldn’t find any resistance in him. The seamless end of his will was, in another light, disappointment. He was truly expressing the deep-seated disappointment that had smoldered within him by completely giving up on resisting.

 

Her breathing quickened. It would have been better if he had grabbed her gun, thrown it away, and choked her mercilessly.

 

Why was he willing to accept everything now?

 

She couldn’t understand. The more incomprehensible points piled up, the more it felt like her brain was being pecked away.

 

Then the gun wobbled.

 

Ulrich had moved the gun he was holding to his forehead down toward his heart. Seeing the barrel of the gun resting like a dot on his broad chest made her feel a chill.

 

So, what I’m saying is, I just don’t understand.

 

Even though she, the one holding the gun, was this shaken, why was he…

 

Why is he….

 

“So, it would be thrilling to end my life by becoming your first target.”

 



 

“Now, hurry up and kill me.”

 



 

“Do you remember how to shoot? I taught you myself.”

 

Seeing him so calmly accepting it, as if he had swallowed resignation, only further unsettled her. Ulrich, as if to show he was completely surrendering, gently closed his eyes.

 

“Ah….”

 

At that moment, Lisbell realized.

 

No matter how much she struggled, she could never defeat him.

 

The reason she had sought weapons while wearing the masks of submission, compromise, and shame.

 

The reason she had wanted to firmly threaten him.

 

It wasn’t just her desire for freedom; deep down, she had a small, dark wish to see him suffer.

 

She wanted him to experience the threat to life, to feel his heart sink, and his chest tighten in despair, just as she had. She didn’t even hope to see him trembling in a weak state; she just wanted him to show, even a little, that he was feeling something like that, even if he tried to hide it. She just wanted to expose his ugly true nature.

 

“Why….”

 

Why can’t I leave any mark on this man?

 

Why is he still so dignified?

 

I’ve become such a wreck.

 

As long as I’m with him, I can’t avoid this state of constant downfall.

 

Is this… what I wanted?

 

Was this the outcome I wanted?

 

“To the point that I’d want to kill myself before I turn thirty.”

 

Her pupils, soaked in moisture, trembled.

 

Yes, now that she thought about it, he had said something like that. With each day filled with a relentless schedule that he handled as if it were his rightful duty, the self-destructive remark had been buried so deep in her memory that she hadn’t even thought to recall it.

 

Although she had initially thought it might not be a joke, she only now began to fully believe it could be true. Otherwise, there was no way to completely justify his current unflinching demeanor.

 

If that truly was his honest feeling, then what she was about to do would end up making him smile…?

 

“Lisbell, what are you doing?”

 

“Let go….”

 

“Shoot me. If you’ve aimed the gun, you need to fire it.”

 

“No. No, let go! Let go of it…!”

 

Frustrated by Lisbell’s inability to pull the trigger, Ulrich used his other hand to wrap around the hand she held the gun with. As her finger was pressed down and then released, the barrel slightly shifted.

 

Bang-!

 

With an immense noise, Lisbell felt as if her shoulder blade had been dislocated. The recoil, as intense as grabbing a rising flame, caused her finger to extend involuntarily, and the gun flew out of her hand to somewhere unknown.

 

“Ah…!”

 

Lisbell, whose body swayed from the unfamiliar pain, screamed. The moment she touched something, a damp sensation seeped into her palm. She quickly pulled her hand back in shock, but it was too late.

 

Her hand was already covered in blood. As Lisbell, trembling, flipped her hand back and forth, her breath caught in her throat as she rubbed it off on the sheet. It was a mistake. The sight of the red puddle soaking the white sheets made her convulse.

 

Gasping, gasping. She panted as if her breath was tightening, stepping back until she fell off the bed. Lisbell wiped her hands desperately on the carpet below. But it wouldn’t come off. It felt as though more was being smeared on, as if a blood-red rain was persistently dripping from the sky.

 

“Hmph, ugh….”

 

As tears suddenly burst from her eyes, she rubbed her cheeks to wipe them away, but the smell of blood became so overwhelming that it stung her nostrils, causing her to scream like a madwoman.

 

Then, a chilling sensation crept up her nape.

 

She pushed herself up from the floor and slowly turned her head back.

 

She saw the wide bed. The place where she had lain, slept, and read for the past few days.

 

She also saw the figure of someone lying there gracefully.

 

Unlike her, who had screamed and trembled all over, the person lying there was perfectly still. Only the brutal fountain of blood erupting from the bullet wound told of his presence.

 

There had been two people in this bedroom.

 

But now there was only one.

 

In other words, there was one person and one former person.

 

To put it more precisely, there was one person and one corpse….

 

“No….”

 

I… I didn’t mean to shoot.

 

If I killed him now, in the end, it would be Ulrich who would laugh, not me. I hesitated at the last moment, thinking that the victory would be his.

 

I wasn’t… going to pull the trigger.

 

“No. No….”

 

Then why is there so much blood?

 

Why isn’t he moving?

 

Why is there so much blood on my hands, and why do I keep feeling sicker and sicker? Why does my head throb with pain, and why does my chest feel like it’s caving in…?

 

“…Ah….”

 

This dangerous and cruel feeling forced her to face an undeniable truth.

 

I killed him.

 

I… killed him.

If asked about the feeling of killing someone for the first time, it was devastating. The indescribable horror surged both inside and out. My mind kept darkening as if the scribbles in it wouldn’t stop. Engulfed by that darkness, whenever I tried to muster any willpower, it would snap like a thread, leaving nothing behind.

 

“Huh…”

 

When what was once imagined became reality, the weight was unbearable.

 

The difference between “I will kill Ulrich Altahart” and “I killed Ulrich Altahart” might seem insignificant in terms of words, but the gap was insurmountable.

 

The difference was whether it could be undone or not.

 

The former had a possibility; the latter did not. Not even a little. Lisbell could no longer go back to the past, nor could she undo what had been done. He had been shot by her on that bed, and his unresponsive body was bleeding profusely, with the brutal evidence of the killing filling the midnight bedroom with a sickly scent.

 

It was an irreversible act.

 

She had…

 

killed a person.

 

“Ugh…!”

 

Her stomach twisted violently, bringing forth the urge to vomit. Curled up in a corner, she retched until her throat burned.

 

“Ugh, ugh, heuk, aah…”

 

She thought she was just dry-heaving, but when she came to her senses, she realized she was crying. Sobbing uncontrollably, tears poured from deep within her, where they had been building up, hot and relentless.

 

She had taken the gun she had stolen from his mother, gripping it with trembling hands, determined.

 

She thought she was ready, but it was all in vain. This was not something one could endure with a clear mind.

 

Surrender? What good would that do?

 

Even if she spent the rest of her life rotting in prison for murder, the memory of that day would remain a permanent scar. It would become a lump, embedded deep in her heart, unable to be expelled or forgotten, and she would live the rest of her life with it, breathing alongside her consciousness.

 

To live with that vile, nauseating lump hanging around her neck for the rest of her life…?

 

No, I can’t.

 

I can’t do it. I can’t do something like that.

 

Lisbell, dazed and staring at the blood and tears-stained ceiling, slowly lifted her head and began to crawl on her knees.

 

The gun. I need to find the gun.

 

She remembered throwing it to the other side of the bed. All she had to do was pick it up and shoot again. Calmly. They said if you shoot at the head or heart, it would be instant death. That would be enough. If she did that, she could be freed from this torment that felt like her insides were being torn apart.

 

Lisbell, pale as wax, crawled around the bed. Her skirt rode up, exposing her bony knees that bumped against the floor, but she didn’t feel any pain. Her mind had broken down, and her senses became irrelevant. The stench of blood that had filled her nose until it was raw had long since faded. All her senses were muffled as if she were submerged in water.

 

Just as she managed to crawl around the bed.

 

Thud, thud!

 

“Young Master, excuse me! I heard gunshots…!”

 

With a rough knock, the door burst open without permission. A fan-shaped light spread across the floor, creeping in. Lisbell, reaching out for the gun in the now slowly taking shape room, turned to look at the door.

 

Victor, panting as if he had run all the way there, flinched upon seeing her blood-stained hands and face, quickly turning his head away. Then, he froze upon discovering the figure on the bed.

 

“Ahhh!”

 

The maid who followed him also checked inside and dropped the lamp she was holding, screaming. At the sharp noise, Victor, regaining his senses, busily issued orders. Several people rushed into the bedroom.

 

Soon, Lisbell, who had been sitting down, felt a rough pressure on her back, forcing her chest to rub against the floor.

 

“A doctor! Quickly!”

 

Victor shouted at the top of his lungs as he rushed to the bed. In Lisbell’s sideways view, she saw a servant picking up the gun that had been thrown into the corner. A few drops of blood stained the ornate, gold-embossed slide.

 

Even though what she sought had been taken right before her eyes, there was no feeling left inside her. It felt as if her chest had been hollowed out. She merely watched the chaos erupting in the middle of the night with an empty gaze.

 

“What on earth….”

 

Altahart’s Madam arrived belatedly.

 

The Madam took a little longer than others to grasp the situation. But she realized the gravity of the matter more keenly than anyone. Otherwise, her face wouldn’t have hardened so much.

 

After a while, the Madam, trembling, held her forehead and staggered. The servant who had accompanied her quickly supported her.

 

She gasped loudly as if in hyperventilation and, with their help, approached the bed. She seemed to struggle with every step as if she couldn’t believe that her son was lying there like a corpse.

 

She gasped sharply as she reached the bed.

 

The area around the bed was already in chaos. A doctor, who had been called immediately since he resided on the estate, was already there, and Victor stood beside him, sleeves rolled up, while a nurse solemnly wiped the blood, and a servant offered towels for the bleeding.

 

Amidst the bustle where time seemed to blur, the Madam stood like a statue. As if wedged into the cracks of time, she was immovable until a moment later when she showed signs of life.

 

“Get her up.”

 

The dry voice from above her head sounded unlike her usual self.

 

Lisbell, pinned down by the pressure on her back, was forced to raise her upper body at the hands that pulled her shoulders up.

 

As soon as her skewed view righted itself, it swayed again.

 

Slap!

 

Her cheek flared with heat. The strike, delivered with force, was infused with a rage that had been accumulating. The raw emotion behind it was too intense to be quelled by just one slap.

 

Slap, slap, slap!

 

The sound of the hand striking her tender flesh resounded repeatedly, as if to prove the point. Soon, the room was filled only with the sound of Lisbell being slapped until her skin nearly tore. Victor and the doctor, who were near the bed, seemed too stunned to grasp what was happening until they rushed over.

 

“Ma’am! Please, calm down!”

 

Unable to touch her recklessly due to her status, Victor quickly stepped in front of her.

 

Shocked by the noblewoman’s violent behavior, the hands of the person holding Lisbell loosened. As Lisbell, who had been leaning against those hands, slipped and collapsed onto the floor.

 

The doctor quickly approached her, checking on her condition. The blood she had swallowed from the blows lingered in her mouth, tasting of iron. Yet, it still didn’t feel real. Her mind was foggy, as if it had been split off, and there was a clear sense of detachment as though she was observing another world.

 

“Move aside, Victor.”

 

“This won’t do, Ma’am. I understand how you feel, but…”

 

“You understand how I feel? If that were true, you wouldn’t be standing in my way like this.”

 



 

“This woman shot my child, Victor. All this blood you smell, it’s all my son’s!”

 

“You have every right to be furious. But there are too many eyes on you, Ma’am. You’re too agitated. Please, try to calm down…”

 

“He’s right, Ma’am. This won’t do…!”

 

The doctor, who had been cautiously examining the collapsed Lisbell, interrupted urgently.

 

“Miss Osborne is currently pregnant. Such a shock could have severe consequences for the fetus…”

 

The lady, who had been on the verge of losing control, seemed to freeze at his words. Her expression, barely contained, crumbled completely.

 

“What did you just say?”

 

And that shock hit Lisbell almost equally. The fragments of her scattered mind snapped back together under the dizzying blow.

 

Lisbell, her face still stained with tears and blood, hesitantly lifted her head.

 

“Pregnant…? Are you saying this woman is carrying my son’s child?”

 

The noblewoman’s voice, slightly trembling, had lost some of its strength.

 

“No, no.”

 

Denial burst forth almost immediately.

 

All eyes turned toward Lisbell, who was trembling as she pushed herself up from the floor.

 

“I… I took the medicine. There’s no way I could be pregnant. The medicine, you gave me, Ma’am. You know, you sent someone to deliver it to me yourself! I took it as you instructed, once a day, without missing a dose. So how could I be pregnant? How could there be something inside me…?”

 

“Didn’t you suspect anything? It appears to have been around two months…”

 

Two months.

 

Lisbell had secretly requested the medicine from the lady about a month ago.

 

Meaning, inside her womb, there was already…

 “Not at all.”

 

The denial burst out once again, driven more by instinct than by consciousness.

 

“No, it’s not there. There’s nothing like that in my, my stomach. It’s not there, so…”

 

Lisbell, shaking her head side to side, soon found herself thrashing wildly, her gray hair whipping around.

 

“It’s not there. I’m telling you, it’s not…!”

 

Madam watching her stepped back, signaling to someone.

 

“Check once more. Make sure to examine her in front of my eyes.”

 

The one who received the signal was the doctor.

 

Lisbell, with a face soaked in tears, fiercely swatted away the doctor’s hand reaching out to her. Then, two servants rushed over to restrain her from moving. Let go, let go of me. Don’t touch me. Don’t lay a hand on me! I said don’t touch me…! Her frantic resistance flailed in the empty air.

 

“As expected, it is true.”

 

The doctor, who had quickly examined Lisbell with the help of the servants, confirmed the diagnosis. By that time, the anger that had heavily colored Madam’s face had slightly faded. Her face, finally regaining its usual calm, turned back to the bed.

 

“…How is Ulrich’s condition?”

 

“It seems that the vital organs were narrowly avoided, but… the blood loss is too severe, so it’s uncertain what will happen next. There’s no disagreement that surgery must be performed as soon as possible.”

 

“Then take action quickly. And also…”

 

As the doctor, who received her instructions, returned to the bedside, Madam’s gaze fell downward. Lisbell, who had been writhing like a fish out of water, found it difficult to breathe when she met the icy coldness of Madam’s eyes.

 

The situation was so strange that the fact that Ulrich wasn’t dead barely registered. Instead, a gloomy intuition flooded her.

 

No, it can’t be.

 

Her instinct whispered those words from deep within.

 

“Madam, the doctor must have made a mistake. It’s certain. You gave me the medicine, didn’t you? You personally gave me the instructions! Madam, please, there’s no way I could be pregnant. Madam, Madam. So, please…”

 

“Take Miss Osborne to the cell for now.”

 

What…?

 

“Don’t forget to make sure she can’t leave on her own.”

 

Madam’s voice was read slowly. Engulfed by it, Lisbell sluggishly realized she was being lifted by the servants. As her vision, stained with tears and the smell of blood, cleared, it finally struck her. It meant they were going to imprison her again in another part of this mansion she thought she’d finally be able to leave…

 

This couldn’t be happening.

 

This wasn’t supposed to happen.

 

Lisbell braced her feet against the ground, resisting the force pulling her away. Then, with a harsh, cracked voice, she clawed toward Madam.

 

“I tried to kill your son!”

 



 

“I tried to kill him, to end his life completely, that’s why I stole the gun. Do you know where I stole it from? Earlier today, I sneaked into your bedroom, found the box where you keep things you don’t want to see, and took it from there. I shot him with that gun, me!”

 



 

“I’m confessing right now. I’m a criminal. I tried to kill someone. Your son, I… So please, send me to prison. I’ll go to prison. Even if you let me go, I’ll go there on my own. You can check later. I won’t run away. I’ll pay for my sins there. So, Madam… Madam! Madam…!”

 

Dragged along, Lisbell spewed out anything she could think of to provoke Madam. But Madam didn’t turn her head even once. Not until Lisbell was finally dragged across the threshold of the bedroom did she see even a glimpse of Madam’s cold face.

 

It felt as if the heavens had completely turned their back on her.

 



 

Lisbell, pacing anxiously by the window, turned desperately toward the sound of the door opening. Altahart’s wife, who had been absent for half a day, appeared with the secretary and two male servants in tow.

 

“Madam….”

 

Lisbell, who had been dragged into a room that seemed to serve as a guest room, had been waiting for her.

 

Having left Ulrich’s room, where the smell of blood had overwhelmed her senses, she found her senses gradually returning, allowing her to piece together the situation.

 

Now that she was more aware, a conversation with Madam felt crucial.

 

Surely, there was still room for negotiation. After all, Madam herself had provided her with the contraceptive. It was evidence that she, too, was not keen on seeing an heir born into this world with Lisbell’s blood.

 

Lisbell had already experienced firsthand how much these people valued bloodlines, given how Noah had been treated in the mansion.

 

Perhaps Madam needed time to collect her thoughts after getting so worked up. After all, the person who had been shot was her son—her only remaining family, child, and the pillar responsible for the future of the household.

 

Even if she had clashed with her son over Lisbell, underneath it all, there was still a parent’s love driving her. And when her child was shot in the middle of the night, it was no wonder her rage had flared up. The lingering warmth on Lisbell’s cheek from where Madam had slapped her was proof enough.

 

When Victor had urgently tried to intervene, seeing Madam slap Lisbell’s cheek had shown that it wasn’t her usual behavior. In all the time Lisbell had known her, she had never shown a sign of losing her composure. Not even when she faced Ulrich pointing a gun at her.

 

Ulrich.

 

Just thinking of his name made Lisbell’s heart clench.

 

She watched as Madam sat down in the chair the secretary had provided. Throughout the waiting period, the bits and pieces of information Lisbell had overheard about his condition swirled in her mind.

 

“It seems that the vital organs were narrowly avoided, but… the blood loss is too severe, so it’s uncertain what will happen next. There’s no disagreement that surgery must be performed as soon as possible.”

 

Although the vital organs were avoided, the blood loss was severe, and surgery needed to be performed as quickly as possible.

 

Perhaps the answer to that problem lay in Madam’s whereabouts during her half-day absence. Lisbell couldn’t help but feel her chest tighten.

 

“Ulrich is…”

 

Just as Lisbell’s thoughts were beginning to overwhelm her, Madam finally opened her mouth after what seemed like an eternity.

 

“He’s alive.”

 

Ah.

 

Lisbell felt a stirring deep within her chest at those words. She couldn’t quite grasp what kind of emotion it was.

 

She hadn’t killed anyone.

 

But she hadn’t succeeded in killing him either.

 

Was this a victory or a defeat?

 

One thing was certain: it wasn’t over. Like a king piece stranded in the middle of the enemy’s territory, her nerves were on edge, wracked with unrelenting anxiety and tension.

 

“But he’s unconscious.”

 

As Lisbell wrestled with her conflicting emotions, Madam’s next words came.

 

“There’s no telling when he’ll wake up.”

 



 

“He might never wake up again.”

 

Madam’s face looked like a shadowed corner. Just seeing it sent a shiver down Lisbell’s spine, as if the abyss itself were staring back at her.

 

“When the doctor gave that prognosis, a thought came to mind, Miss Osborne.”

 



 

“If the medical outcome is so uncertain… then what’s the difference between that and my son being dead?”

 

That abyss crushed her. Even though countless words were building up on her tongue, she couldn’t bring herself to say anything.

 

Lisbell could only look up at Madam with terrified eyes.

 

“Every minute and every second is precious now, but time is slipping away meaninglessly. The inevitable mess caused by the absence of the leader, the complex issues within the family, including the heir… Just the fact that this situation has arisen makes me feel as if I’ve already faced Ulrich’s death.”

 

Madam’s rebuke, as if asking if Lisbell even understood the gravity of Ulrich’s absence and its implications, was sharp. The calmness in her voice made it even more cutting.

 

Lisbell didn’t care about such situations. If Ulrich hadn’t pushed her to this point, none of this would have happened. All she wanted was to escape from him and this place. Why had it come to this, where she now faced Madam in such an unsettling confrontation?

 

“Miss Osborne, did you say you were willing to pay for your sins?”

 

Finally, Madam’s voice fell, crisp and clear.

 

“You can atone by giving birth to the child inside you.”

 Despite being so clear and straightforward, why did it sound like a cruel command for Lisbell to ascend the guillotine? The voice was as if it had already organized all thoughts, demanding that she meekly surrender her life and accept the fate that had befallen her, without even allowing her to struggle. This made her feel dizzy, causing Lisbell to stagger on the spot.

 

A massive earthquake seemed to erupt before her eyes as she clutched her forehead and barely managed to speak.

 

“When I said I would atone for my sins… I meant taking legal responsibility.”

 



 

“Not here, not by being treated like this… as atonement…”

 

No matter how much she tried to hold onto her sanity, it didn’t go as planned. It was too difficult. Suddenly, her whole body felt heavy. Her arms, legs, and even her shoulders all felt as if they were being dragged to the ground.

 

Above all, her belly, which she couldn’t bring herself to look at or touch, was so repulsive from the moment she began to recognize it.

 

Unable to endure it any longer, Lisbell collapsed to the floor.

 

“You didn’t like it either, did you? That the child born from my blood would become the heir to this family.”

 



 

“That’s why you gave me the medicine, right? Because you didn’t want a commoner to bear the Altahart’s seed, you agreed with what I said! But why are you doing this now? Why did you change your mind? How can you ask me to give birth to a child with the blood of someone dirty and low like me, the child of that man! Madam…!”

 

“Because Ulrich might not wake up.”

 



 

“Miss Osborne, think of it this way. We are making a compromise: we will turn a blind eye to the terrible crime you committed in exchange for you giving birth to the child. If you hand over the child to me afterward, we won’t hold you accountable for your crime. That would be far better than being dragged to prison after a capital trial and spending your life there.”

 

“What do you mean, better!”

 



 

“What exactly is better? Madam, how could you say that, how could….”

 

How could that be possible…

 

She started feeling nauseous again. Enduring the twisting sensation at the back of her throat, Lisbell glared at Madam. A bitter déjà vu hit her. His son always looked down on her as if he were examining her from above, and the same was true of his mother.

 

Altahart always lorded over someone else, casually breaking and shattering people’s dignity. In their view, there was no respect or guilt…

 

There would never be any respect for the unborn child or herself in this household. There were the times she had endured and the lessons she learned from watching Noah.

 

The unborn child would be an indelible curse on her life.

 

It would be the result of a relationship she never wanted with Ulrich, and a lifelong shackle that she couldn’t escape. It would forever trap her under the shadow of this family.

 

No… no!

 

Putting aside all these relationships and causality, she simply found it abhorrent. It was disgusting, loathsome, and repulsive. The idea of giving birth to Ulrich Altahart’s child, raising his child in her belly, made her shudder.

 

She wanted to deny it all. She wanted to believe that such a thing would never happen, that it couldn’t happen.

 

“Madam, please… please reconsider….”

 

Lisbell crawled over and clutched Madam’s knees. The servants behind her flinched for a moment, but since Madam gave no specific orders, they remained silent. Meanwhile, Lisbell clung to Madam’s knees and pleaded earnestly.

 

“Ulrich is not dead. He will… he will surely wake up. When that happens, you can have him marry the young lady of a family you desire and have a proper heir. There’s no need for me to get involved, no need for me to be in the way. Isn’t that right? Madam….”

 



 

“Please don’t do this. I was wrong. I was foolish. So please, let me atone for my sins in some other way… a trial, yes, I’ll stand trial at the capital and go to prison. I’ll live in prison for the rest of my life. It’s okay if I never come out. I’ll atone that way. I’ll always live with a heart full of remorse! So….”

 

“Enough.”

 



 

“Miss Osborne, any further discussion is just a waste of time.”

 

Madam, who had been gazing at Lisbell impassively, stood up with an expression that showed no trace of emotion. Lisbell, biting her lip until it bled, grabbed the hem of Madam’s dress as she tried to leave. Only then did the servants intervene to pry her off.

 

“No, don’t go. Let me out of here. Let me out…! Why are you doing this to me! Why, why!”

 

Madam, who had been heading toward the door, turned around at the sound of Lisbell’s desperate cries.

 

“Indeed…”

 



 

“Why did you shoot my son?”

 

The reproach was so simple. Madam’s words, mixed with both frustration and exasperation, were like a misfired bullet. Her voice carried the implication that everything that had happened to Lisbell was her own fault. There was even a hint of disdain in her tone.

 

As that blatant criticism hit her ears, something inside Lisbell snapped.

 

“Why….”

 



 

“Because… because he hurt me….”

 

Her voice, which had started out clumsy, gradually dried up. She could no longer bear the intense emotions that surged like wildfire within her. Lisbell’s features contorted in anguish.

 

“Because he made my life miserable…!”

 



 

“Because he ruined me like this!”

 

Lisbell sprang up and lunged at Madam. But she didn’t get far. The servants nearby grabbed her shoulders and arms, stopping her in her tracks.

 

Yet, Lisbell, as if she had nothing more to lose, started screaming and flailing her limbs at Madam. She had reached the end of her endurance, throwing everything away in desperation. Although she was eventually pinned to the floor, her back against it, Lisbell continued to scream her curses with a tightened jaw.

 

“He ruined my fiancé’s life, and he insulted my mother’s last moments!”

 



 

“It’s all Ulrich Altahart’s fault…. He brought it upon himself!”

 

So don’t blame me, she shouted, saying that he was merely punished according to natural order, that if someone commits a sin, it will inevitably come back to them. But her words never reached their intended target. Madam had already left the room.

 

The sound of the door clicking shut was immediately followed by long streams of tears rolling down Lisbell’s cheeks.

 

“No…”

 

She couldn’t let Madam leave like this. Struggling to free herself from the arms holding her down, Lisbell desperately tried to crawl toward the door. Perhaps because Madam had safely left the room, the grip of the servants holding her down had weakened slightly. Lisbell, as if she only knew how to move forward, crawled on her knees and pounded on the door.

 

“Madam, madam…! Just a moment. Let’s talk again…. Please, listen to me. Madam! You can’t leave like this. You can’t….”

 

There’s no one but you who can save me from here.

 

There’s no one else who would listen to me.

 

“Madam, I, I was wrong. I was angry and misspoke. So please forgive me. Please come back. Please open this door, don’t leave me locked up here. Don’t leave me here… Madam… Madam…!”

 

She pounded on the door so hard that it shook, but as soon as she grabbed the handle, it was snatched away by the servants who rushed over. Dragged back toward the bed, Lisbell could only stare at the door that grew farther and farther away. She watched, hoping that the door would reopen, with a desperate and persistent gaze. But the door did not betray her by reopening.

 



 

As she feared, there was no room for negotiation with Madam.

 

It was something she came to realize over time.

 

After conveying her message, “We will turn a blind eye to your crime if you give birth to the child in your womb,” Madam never visited the room again. She simply sent people to ensure that Lisbell was fed and monitored every moment of her actions.

 

It was around that time that the tormenting morning sickness began.

“Ugh…”

 

Even though she hadn’t eaten anything, her stomach churned, twisted, and retched uncontrollably. The only thing that came up was the bitter bile since there was nothing else in her stomach. She overturned all the food that was served in protest of this situation, but even if she had the will, Lisbell wouldn’t have been able to eat it, so nauseating it was.

 

Exerting energy without filling up with anything left her utterly drained. Lisbell’s days were mostly spent lying down. In any case, it wasn’t much different from before she knew she was pregnant, so nothing had changed significantly.

 

Cough.

 

Lisbell coughed softly, her eyelids fluttering. She saw the sunlight filtering in from afar. Perhaps because of the curtains around the bed, the light didn’t reach this far inside. Feeling as if she was sinking into muddy water, she stared at the area where the sun shone brightly enough to make the dust rise. She reached out her weak hand, but it didn’t reach. It was too far away.

 

So… why am I here?

 

Ah, I shot Ulrich with a gun.

 

Just recalling it made her whole body shudder from the recoil. It was still horrifying. No, the present was even more horrifying. If she had known it would lead to this… she wouldn’t have done something as crazy as shooting him.

 

‘…No.’

 

If she hadn’t left him on the brink of death, by now, she would have been walking into a palace-like wedding venue, dressed in an extravagant wedding dress that didn’t suit her at all. Could she have endured that? She would have pulled out the sharp stems of the bouquet she held tightly and stabbed him right in the heart. It was so horrifying, so terrible. The thought of becoming his bride was unbearably repulsive and nauseating…

 

‘And now…?’

 

Isn’t it still the same?

 

There’s no difference in the fact that it turned out to be a dreadful situation.

 

So, what exactly did I do…?

 

Even after committing the heinous act of intending to kill someone, finishing the sin with my hands soaked in blood, why do I still have to be here?

 

Ah, did I come to hell?

 

Is this hell?

 

If I had known, I should have made sure to kill him. Instead of being scared out of my wits, I should have held the gun steady and put a proper hole in either his forehead or heart. I should have completely… cut off his breath.

 

Would I then have been reported without question, handed over to the authorities, stood trial in the capital, and ended up in a prison? Spending the rest of my life locked in a cell, a place swarming with rats and dust.

 

But what’s the difference between that place and here? Both are prisons. Here is just a bit bigger, fancier, with meals served on time.

 

In the end, is it all the same?

 

The fact that I’ve fallen into hell alive remains unchanged.

 

“…Ugh…!”

 

No, it wasn’t the same. It wasn’t all the same. That was immediately apparent through her physical symptoms.

 

Lisbell, who had been lying down as if she was about to close her eyes, suddenly twisted her upper body. She hung her head over the side of the bed and started retching aimlessly.

 

Her mouth, which had opened wide and was now gasping for breath, was filled with nothing but vile saliva. Her stomach churned as if someone was pounding on her guts. Her energy, already at rock bottom, drained further. Lisbell’s thin arm, which had been clutching the edge of the bed frame, dropped to the floor.

 

“Ah…”

 

Why do I keep feeling so sick?

 

No.

 

It’s not like I’ve eaten anything properly.

 

No.

 

Is it because my condition is bad?

 

No.

 

If not, then…

 

You know.

 

Barely lifting her upper body, Lisbell curled herself up and covered both ears. She pressed her palms and even her index and middle fingers tightly against her eardrums. Even so, it felt like someone kept whispering ominously into her ears.

 

You know it well.

 

It’s just a little nausea.

 

It’s inside your belly.

 

It’s only being affected by your poor mood.

 

His child.

 

There’s nothing wrong with your body…

 

The sprout you must give birth to…

 

“No…”

 

No, no, no!

 

Lisbell, who had been curled up so small she might disappear in an instant, abruptly sat up. She was so terrified that the sound might get louder that her hands never left the vicinity of her ears. She slammed her head hard against the wall while still covering her ears.

 

Bang! Bang! Bang!

 

She intended to keep hitting until the hallucinations stopped, but instead, the more she hit, the louder the sound became. Above the eerie hallucination, someone’s mocking laughter began to echo, gnawing at her skin. A strange rhythm, made by slowly rolling the tongue inside the mouth, accompanied the sneers.

 

“Lisbell, if you think too much for someone as naive as you, this is what happens.”

 

Why was that phrase coming to mind now?

 

“You only make things worse.”

 

Did I… ruin everything again?

 

Did I try to do something, only to end up walking into the darkest depths on my own?

 

Lisbell’s head, which had been staring blankly at the wall as if she might collapse at any moment, gradually drooped.

 

No, there was still something worse.

 

‘I can’t… give birth.’

 

They’ll overlook the crime if I give birth?

 

Nonsense. If that seed grows inside me and eventually becomes a person, it will be the greatest sin of my life. It would undoubtedly become a wretched existence. The child, born between an inhuman father and a mother who receives such awful treatment, would have a future as clear as day.

 

If the child were already born, it would be different, but since there’s still time, I have to stop it somehow. Even if it means cutting open my belly and tearing it out, I’d rather die than give birth to Ulrich’s child.

 

This would be the last responsibility she would bear.

 

As if possessed, Lisbell raised her arm. She then slapped her stomach with a loud thud. Her other arm crossed and rose. And again, smack. Smack, smack. Her upper stomach began to throb as if it were being tugged, but she mercilessly continued to strike herself.

 

She hit and slapped herself at random, but her limits were quickly reached. She was exhausted in no time. It wasn’t the kind of parasite that could be removed with just this. Given that it had survived even the drugs the lady had given her, it was sure to be a tenacious, creepy life form.

 



 

Her lost gaze wandered around the bedroom. Soon after, she spotted a chair. With sluggish movements, she got off the bed and approached the chair. She lifted it up and then slammed it down hard. The loud thud shook the entire bedroom.

 

Perhaps due to her lack of strength, she wobbled after just two attempts. She had intended to break the chair and use its leg, but it seemed impossible.

 

In the end, Lisbell toppled the chair over and tried to use her own body to slam into her belly. She wished her stomach would burst open entirely. She wanted to bleed so much that she would have to be rushed to the hospital immediately. She wanted to use such reckless tactics to escape this bedroom.

 

But before she could carry out her dream-like plan, the door suddenly burst open.

 

“What the…!”

 

“What are you doing!”

 

Two strong men rushed in and grabbed her arms, lifting her up.

 

“Let go, let… let me go….”

 

Her desperate struggles were to no avail. As soon as she was safely moved back to the bed, Lisbell began hitting her stomach again. Terrified by her actions, the servants had no choice but to tie her hands to the bed to stop her.

 

As a temporary measure, they used a tieback, but after she passed out and woke up again, they replaced it with a rope that wouldn’t loosen no matter how much she twisted her wrists.

 

In this house, any object could easily change its purpose. Perhaps, in such ways, she wasn’t the only one who gradually lost her breath under this kind of oppression. If so, this mansion was indeed a swamp that devoured people.

 

Outwardly, it seemed like a flashy paradise, but in reality, it was the opposite. And she, too, would become a sacrificial offering to be devoured. Her flesh would be torn apart, her bones ground to dust, and her internal organs mashed into pulp. There was no doubt she would experience a pain equivalent to that.

 

“Excuse me…”

 

She stirred and called out. She thought she was using all her strength, but her throat was so constricted that only a raspy, metallic sound came out.

 

Excuse me, excuse me. She called out a few more times, but the closed door didn’t budge. It only continued to confine her in solitude. Lisbell tried to cause another commotion, but with her arms tied, she couldn’t move beyond a certain radius from the bed.

 

Bang.

 

Bang, bang, bang.

 

Eventually, she banged her head against the wall.

 

She didn’t think she had hit it that hard, but at some point, the smell of blood suddenly filled the air. Without even realizing it, the skin near her forehead had split, and blood began to flow. As Lisbell stared at the red stain as if it belonged to someone else, the door creaked open.

 

She was once again faced with the servants, who looked as if they had forgotten how to speak. Their faces were those of people who had witnessed something utterly bizarre. It was then that Lisbell realized what kind of misunderstanding they had.

 

Before she could say anything, actions were taken. The rope binding her arms was shortened, and this time, her ankles were also tightly bound so that she couldn’t move at all. She was left in a state where she could do nothing but roll slightly from side to side.

 

Around that time, Lisbell deeply realized that the lady intended to imprison her.

 

Lisbell spent the entire day watching the sun rise and set through the window, and as dusk turned into night, she bit down on her tongue with all her strength.

Once again, she didn’t feel the pain was that severe, but blood quickly filled her mouth.

 

Her vision became hazy and blurred. Even though her eyes couldn’t focus, Lisbell continued to gnash her tongue as if her goal was to sever it completely, panting with the metallic taste of blood. After a while, she couldn’t tell whether she was biting her tongue or the rapidly forming froth of blood.

 

Her consciousness faded in an instant.

 

When her senses finally returned, as if they had been severed and reattached, her mouth felt unnatural. Something was firmly lodged inside. It wasn’t until she sluggishly rolled her eyes and wiggled her tongue—still intact, despite her earlier efforts—that she realized a towel had been forced into her mouth as a gag.

 

So it doesn’t get cut off that easily.

 

At that moment, she made a vague resolution to bite down harder next time. Just then, the door in the distance opened, and for the first time in a long while, Madam of the house made her appearance.

 

The one who had stripped away her freedom and confined her here appeared as flawless as ever, to a maddening degree. She looked so perfect that she could have gone out and been treated with respect by anyone, exuding a living elegance that was like a textbook. Unlike Lisbell, who was bound hand and foot with a towel gagging her mouth, the difference was staggering. Lisbell cursed her own weakness for not fully severing her tongue.

 

“Miss Osborne.”

 

As Madam approached the bed, the servants tidying up around her retreated politely. Madam sat softly on the bed. Her calm, gray-blue eyes brushed over Lisbell’s arms, legs, and mouth.

 

“What is all this?”

 



 

“If you had only behaved, it wouldn’t have come to this…”

 

Her tone was as consistent as ever. Still flowing like water, she was quick to shift the blame onto others. It was your fault for not behaving, she seemed to say, that you ended up in this sorry state.

 

That was wrong.

 

Lisbell was no longer confused. The reason she was in this predicament was that Madam had imprisoned her here without her consent. And if she delved a little deeper, it was because she had shot Ulrich Altahart with a gun—and that, too, was something the man had brought upon himself.

 

Altaharts were all like this. Ulrich wasn’t the only cruel one. After all, where would such bloodlines go? They were all molded by the same family, raised within the walls of their shared blood.

 

“Don’t do anything foolish from now on.”

 

A voice warned her, telling her not to make an enemy of Madam. Who said that? She couldn’t quite recall. Was it someone she didn’t know? Someone she did? It was blurry.

 

“As long as Ulrich’s baby is in your womb, you must not die on your own accord.”

 

Why? She wanted to ask, but with her mouth gagged, she could only stare at Madam. Madam met her gaze for a moment, then reached out. Her neat fingers brushed away Lisbell’s disheveled hair and smoothed down her side locks.

 

“Miss Osborn, instead of continuing like this, why not change your mind?”

 

Ah, why do these Altaharts like to say that so much?

 

Ulrich had told her that several times as well.

 

They kept telling her to change. What? Her thoughts. Why? She didn’t know. They just kept saying it like that. Change. Ah, right. What? Oh, right, her thoughts. Change her thoughts… Does that mean what she’s thinking is inherently wrong? So, she should conform to the superiority they were born with? She didn’t understand. Why…? She didn’t understand. But what was she supposed to change again? Ah, her thoughts…

 

What will change if she changes her thoughts?

 

More importantly, she couldn’t overlook that the Altaharts were abnormal before thinking about changing herself. Someone had once told her this.

 

“All the people in this family are completely crazy.”

 

Who said that? It was a man… No, wait. Was it a woman? What… Hinse? No, that wasn’t the name. I can’t remember.

 

Whoever it was, what did it matter? There was someone who had boldly pointed out their abnormality.

 

Someone’s long fingers had circled near her head.

 

Round and round, round and round, round and round.

 

That’s right. The Altaharts were all strange. Not just that—they were a harmful, unhealthy bunch. They lived with a few screws loose that should have been securely in place.

 

They never considered how unvirtuous they were, instead, forcing others to fit into their standards. Naturally, I would be whittled away. I’d be left as just a torso, perhaps even a stump, with parts of my body bluntly damaged. If that happened, I’d be worn down to nothing, neither this nor that.

 

That’s how things came to this point.

 

“If you have any desires, feel free to ask.”

 



 

“Do you want an enormous fortune so you’ll never have to work again? Or perhaps the ownership of a building on Central Avenue? Or even jewels so rare they’re among the world’s most prized?”

 



 

“As long as you safely give birth to Ulrich’s child, whatever it is, I’ll place it in your hands. If you don’t trust me, we can even draw up a contract.”

 

Lisbell’s lips, forced open by the towel, trembled painfully. She looked like a land animal desperately trying to take a breath underwater. Even though it was obvious she would sink faster as water filled her lungs, she was blinded by the immediate sense of danger and couldn’t realize it… how foolish…

 

No sound came out. Even so, Lisbell kept moving her lips. It was a small movement, but Madam’s eyes caught something in it, her pupils rippling slightly.

 

Soon, Madam rose from the bed.

 

“Take your time to think it over. There’s plenty of time.”

 

Madam turned her back, but Lisbell continued to move her lips, as if still convinced Madam’s eyes were on her.

 

Freedom.

 

Give me freedom.

 

She kept mouthing those words. That’s all she wanted. She didn’t care about an enormous fortune, a grand building, or sparkling jewels. All she wanted was to raise her arms high, bask in the sunlight, and be carried away by the wind to wherever she wished.

 

It wasn’t just for herself. It also applied to the existence that had taken root in her womb, no matter how hard she tried to suppress it—a presence that had become an uncomfortable consciousness.

 

This child, as soon as it was born, would be swallowed whole by this mansion, which was beautiful only on the outside. It wouldn’t even be given a proper name, like Noah, and would be stifled by the smallest of things, withering away day by day.

 

That was a fate as clear as death. The obliteration of one’s personality is a death of a higher order. No matter how much she breathed and lived, it felt no different from dying.

 

So, am I carrying death in my womb?

 

If that’s true, isn’t it best if it’s stillborn?

 

Wouldn’t that be the greatest mercy I could offer this life?

 

But it seemed Madam thought differently. Her offer of compromise was severe. The process by which Lisbell would receive any material reward was predicated on the condition of ‘giving birth to the baby.’

 

Madam was determined to ensure this child saw the harsh light of the world, regardless of whether it blinded it or caused its skin to rot.

 

“Kkh…”

 

A sob burst out unexpectedly. Tears flowed freely. Lisbell wept with her mouth gagged. She wanted to persuade Madam, even with that pitiful sound.

 

Madam, it’s you who needs to change your mind.

 

Please, don’t ask me to give birth to death.

 

Please, return the freedom that your son took from me.

 

She gazed at Madam with eyes full of countless unspoken words. Madam, who had turned away, glanced at the bed. Lisbell heard a servant, who had been cautiously observing, ask in a low voice.

 

“If we remove the towel, she might try to bite her tongue again… What should we do about meals?”

 

“Try to coax her. If she doesn’t want to starve to death, she’ll eat something.”

 

“If that’s still difficult…”

 

“Just remember one thing. The baby in her womb is more important to me than the mother.”

 

“….”

 

“What I’m saying is, as long as the baby survives, it doesn’t matter what happens to the mother.”

 

That was an insult disguised in elegant words.

 

The comment was so blatant that even the servant fell silent. While Lisbell lay bound on the bed, there was no way she could have missed those words.

 

The movement of Lisbell’s lips, which had been faintly moving as if she were barely breathing, suddenly stopped. Her purple eyes, fixed on Madam’s back, soon slid shut. When her vision darkened, her senses became more vivid. She felt as though she was plummeting endlessly.

 

She had long since been abandoned by God.

 

Now, all that remained was to see how far she would fall.

“Whoo…”

 

Victor loosened his tightly knotted tie slightly and collapsed into the chair.

 

His eyelids, squeezed shut from frowning, felt like they were being pricked by needles. It had been so long since he last slept that he could barely remember—maybe three days ago, when he caught a brief nap in the office.

 

The moment he became aware of it, his eyes felt like they were about to pop out of his head. He lifted his arm and pressed his eyelids firmly. When he finally moved his hand and opened his eyes slightly, his vision was blurry. After blinking several times, the shapes in front of him gradually came into focus.

 

“…..”

 

His hand, which had been suspended in midair, hesitated before dropping limply to the floor.

 

Victor swallowed a sigh and stared at the bed with a complicated expression. On it, a man lay asleep, as beautiful as a preserved statue.

 

It was his superior, Ulrich Altahart.

 

‘…Has it been about two months?’

 

Since the sudden gunshot that led to surgery and left Ulrich in a coma.

 

Even in the midst of the chaos where days blurred together, Victor would occasionally fall asleep, only to dream of that day.

 

No matter when he recalled it, the scene was always terrifying. The bedroom, where moonlight shone unusually blue through the clouds past midnight, and the image of a woman sitting in a pool of blood, her face and hands covered in it, with a man sprawled lifelessly behind her.

 

It was as if a fierce light exploded in his mind.

 

Finally… something terrible had happened.

 

The moment he encountered the scene before him, a grim intuition ripped through his brain. And it was just as he feared. Ulrich, lying on the shadowed bed, had a gaping wound in his abdomen, with blood gushing out so profusely that it was impossible to even examine the wound properly.

 

The vivid marks of a violent death.

 

Even though his mind had frozen solid like a stone, his body moved on its own. He screamed for someone until his throat nearly gave out. It was only when a doctor appeared before him that Victor realized he had called for the family physician.

 

While the ashen-faced doctor barked orders at his assistants and the household staff, Victor’s head turned as if searching for someone. Among the people pouring into the room, his eyes landed on a woman sitting motionless.

 

There was no will to resist from the beginning. Lisbell Osborne, the culprit behind this disaster, did not resist being subdued by force. She simply stared blankly at the side, as if she had done what needed to be done.

 

Victor felt a chill so intense it made his hair stand on end as he watched her.

 

‘Was it all… an act?’

 

He wondered if she had changed her mind.

 

He thought his advice had been taken to heart.

 

According to Ulrich, he had said he no longer wanted to suffer and wanted to find peace.

 

Days that had finally begun to settle into calmness seemed to confirm those words.

 

But it wasn’t just Ulrich who had let his guard down. In some ways, Victor had been even more complacent than Ulrich.

 

‘Was she targeting him from the beginning…?’

 

This meant that Lisbell Osborne had steeled herself to this resolution. She had deceived even him, to the point where he thought he no longer needed to keep such a close eye on her… And then she had shot Ulrich.

 

The result was the ghastly scene in the early dawn.

 

Ulrich, who was rushed into surgery, fortunately survived, but he did not regain consciousness. Though the bullet had missed any vital organs, the delay in treatment led to significant blood loss, which caused additional complications. Even the doctors couldn’t predict when he would wake up. All they could do was wait in silence for him to open his eyes.

 

Ulrich’s condition was, of course, kept a secret. Every precaution was taken to ensure that no information leaked out. As his secretary, Victor had also been living a hectic life, working non-stop to fill in the gaps left by Ulrich’s absence.

 

While everyone around him suffered and toiled, Ulrich Altahart slept soundly, his face looking almost annoyingly peaceful. Despite having been unconscious for nearly two months, his naturally superior physique showed no signs of wasting away. He simply looked like someone in a deep, long dream.

 

“Young Master.”

 

Victor called out, half hoping against hope. The silence that followed was his only reply. A foreboding feeling trailed behind the quiet, whispering that Ulrich might never wake up.

 

If that were to happen, what would become of them?

 

Would the role of head of the family, temporarily reassigned, return to his mother? For now, they could manage with a temporary replacement, but what about afterward? The issue of succession was the most pressing matter. Would Gwen’s illegitimate child, sent off to Tukenia, return?

 

“…Ah.”

 

Victor was suddenly reminded of that unsettling early morning two months ago, which he kept trying to forget. It all started with the doctor’s comment after he had leaped out of bed, startled by his mother’s slap.

 

“Miss Osborne is currently pregnant. If she experiences such shocks, it will inevitably have a negative impact on the fetus…”

 

Victor guessed that this revelation had shattered Lisbell’s resolve. The expression on her face as she learned something even she hadn’t known, alongside others, was unlike anything he’d seen. Even if the world were to end tomorrow, he doubted she could replicate that expression. It was an expression of despair so intense that Victor, in his sober state, could barely bring himself to keep watching.

 

‘The Madam… said she would take her away.’

 

After that day, Lisbell fell under the control of Ulrich’s mother. It all happened so quickly that Victor didn’t have a chance to intervene. To be fair, he was already overwhelmed, focusing all his attention on Ulrich’s condition and the business issues that arose in his absence as the head of the family.

 

When he later asked the Madam about it, she simply said that she was handling it. Handling it… He didn’t know what that meant, but given the issue of succession, it likely wasn’t something harsh or merciless. Maintaining Lisbell’s mental and physical health would be essential for the fetus’s growth.

 

‘She did ask me to call for the Madam before… She must have had something to rely on, so she’ll be fine.’

 

Even though he couldn’t help but worry, Victor knew he couldn’t deal with everything at once. He was just one man, after all. No matter how many hands he had, they would never be enough.

 

It had only been two months, but it felt like two years had passed. Each day flew by so fast that Victor barely had time to catch his breath. He was running so hard that he couldn’t take in his surroundings. Lately, the only place where Victor could finally breathe was in Ulrich’s room.

 

‘It might be better than when the Young Master was awake…’

 

With his hands clasped between his knees, Victor stared at the bed with a somber expression. He knew deep down that this was just a rationalization to put his mind at ease.

 

Lisbell was the woman who had shot Ulrich to escape from him. Would she really accept his child so easily? It didn’t seem likely.

 

But what could he do?

 

With the Madam involved, there was nothing more he, as a mere secretary, could do. With Ulrich unable to fulfill his duties as head of the family, Cora Altahart had taken control of the Altahart family once again. Her authority was justified, and there was no one to challenge her.

 

“…How long do you plan to sleep?”

 

Victor knew Ulrich better than anyone, but the anxiety that had settled in his heart wouldn’t easily dissipate. The only way to alleviate it was for Ulrich to wake up as soon as possible.

 

“Please open your eyes, Young Master.”

 

I’m getting tired too. I don’t understand why I, just a salaried employee, have to deal with all these trivial matters. What’s the point of a large paycheck? My nerves are fraying, and I feel weaker by the day. Is that money supposed to be compensation?

 

Victor buried his face in his hands and let out a small groan. He slowly opened his eyes, resigned.

 

“…Young Master?”

 

This time was no different. He didn’t realize he had spoken until after the words left his mouth. But he didn’t have time to dwell on it.

 

Victor jumped up and rushed to the bedside.

 

Just now, Ulrich’s index finger had definitely twitched.

“Young Master, can you hear me? Young Master!”

 

Victor hastily opened his mouth, focusing intently on Ulrich’s breathing. He even leaned forward, closely examining every corner of Ulrich’s face. Yet, just as if he had caught a mirage, everything remained as it was before. Even the slight movement of the fingers, which had offered a glimmer of hope, had now stilled as if nothing had happened.

 

Nevertheless, clinging to the faint hope, Victor immediately called for a doctor.

 

“Did you say his fingers moved?”

 

“Yes. It was very slight, but I’m certain.”

 

The doctor closely examined Ulrich’s condition. Standing behind him, Victor anxiously watched, rubbing his lips. Not long after, Ulrich’s fingers twitched again, showing a lively response. Both the doctor and Victor let out gasps at the same time.

 

“Is he regaining consciousness?”

 

Victor asked, hesitating as he watched the doctor thoroughly inspect Ulrich.

 

“Not fully yet, but there’s a strong possibility he’s partially regaining consciousness. In these cases, the stimulus often starts in areas where normal daily reactions occur, like the fingers or toes. Regardless, it’s a good sign. He might fully wake up in a short time.”

 

Victor’s heart pounded slowly.

 

Finally, could it be?

 

It was the first good news in two months. To Victor, who felt those two months had dragged on for what seemed like two years, the news was immensely welcome.

 

He immediately left the bedroom to find the Madam.

 

“Where is the Madam? I have urgent news about the Young Master’s condition.”

 

“She is in her bedroom. I will guide you.”

 

It wasn’t until he stepped into the guided bedroom that Victor realized it had been a long time since he had been in this space. He thought it was always a place so grand it could leave one feeling small as he moved further inside.

 

The Madam was sitting at a table on the path leading to the terrace, drinking tea. She seemed to be enjoying her tea time, but a pile of documents, daunting even to Victor’s schedule, was stacked in front of her, and her personal secretary was seated across from her. As Victor approached and bowed in greeting, the Madam gestured for the secretary to leave.

 

“Victor, what brings you here?”

 

“I know you’re busy, but I came because I wanted to deliver some news to you personally.”

 

“News?”

 

“The Young Master has shown signs of life.”

 

The Madam’s hand, which had been about to pick up the teacup, paused.

 

“…What?”

 

“His fingers moved.”

 

“Does that mean… Ulrich is waking up?”

 

“Not fully yet. However, the doctor said it’s a good sign. He could regain full consciousness soon.”

 

Victor had imagined the Madam’s face as she received this news. She was a noblewoman through and through, one who understood the importance of dignity. But even such a person had lost her composure when her son had collapsed, spewing blood. The way she had struck another in a place filled with onlookers was proof of that.

 

At that moment, she had lost her reason, even if only for an instant. It was a side of her that Victor had rarely seen, a mother’s true nature.

 

Of course, he hadn’t expected her to react as she had that day, by jumping out of her seat or dropping the teacup she was holding in an outburst of joy. He had only hoped to see some joy flicker across her face. After all, Ulrich’s sudden illness had surely disturbed more than just himself.

 

However, the Madam’s reaction was ambiguous.

 

“…Madam?”

 

Victor spoke, bewildered.

 

Her eyes returned to him as if she had just come to her senses.

 

“Oh, yes. Victor. That is wonderful news.”

 



 

“My son is finally waking up.”

 

“…Yes, Madam. Indeed.”

 

Although he was responding, an uneasy feeling gnawed at him from within. Victor couldn’t shake off the disquieting sense that something was off as he forced a smile.

 

“You’ve worked so hard all this time.”

 

“No, it was only my duty.”

 

“I can’t tell you how relieved I am that someone like you is by my son’s side.”

 

Her voice was tender.

 

But what was wrong?

 

To Victor’s ears, it sounded like an empty shell with no substance. The Madam then smiled warmly, as if hoping to erase that thought from his mind.

 

“I’ll have my secretary look into giving you a bonus.”

 

“There’s no need for that, Madam. As I said, it was merely my duty.”

 

“Don’t refuse. It’s the least I can do for you. If it makes you uncomfortable, think of it as a token of appreciation for the continued care you’ll provide. You’ve helped me with Ulrich more times than I can count.”

 

Victor swallowed hard. The Madam’s eyes softened further.

 

“I hope you’ll continue like this.”

 

“Continue… you say?”

 

“Yes. I want you to keep me updated on my son’s condition.”

 



 

“I’m eagerly waiting for the day Ulrich opens his eyes.”

 

As the acting head of the household, the Madam was too busy, much like Victor, to constantly keep a watchful eye on her son’s condition. The stack of documents before her was proof enough of that.

 

Although she had visited Ulrich’s bedroom daily for about two weeks after his surgery, her visits had gradually decreased, and now she only received reports through the servants.

 

No one found this odd since there was no guarantee that her presence would wake Ulrich, nor did it benefit the family business to waste time like that. In fact, knowing her as someone who prioritized maximizing profits, it seemed more appropriate.

 

Indeed, the emotional reunion between mother and son could wait until Ulrich fully regained consciousness.

 

“Yes, Madam. I will do as you wish.”

 

So, overall, there was nothing particularly strange…

 

‘Why does something feel so… off?’

 

What was this nagging feeling?

 

Even though a strange aura seemed to surround him, he couldn’t quite grasp it.

 

His unsettled mind wouldn’t clear, so as soon as he left the bedroom and rounded the corner of the hallway, he leaned against the wall. His shadow stretched thinly across the carpeted floor. His rational mind knew he shouldn’t waste time like this. Even now, his tasks were piling up. But for some reason, he couldn’t shake the lingering unease…

 

“…Madam?”

 

He called out to her as if in a trance, prompted by something.

 

Back then, the Madam had definitely… frowned slightly.

 

Right after hearing the news that Ulrich was waking up.

 

The expression she showed after that, the one that seemed pleased, felt like a carefully crafted facade. Before rejoicing in her son’s recovery, she had first shown a troubled look.

 

Why?

 

Wasn’t Ulrich’s recovery something the Madam had also longed for?

 

Hadn’t she only resumed her position as head of the household because of Ulrich’s unexpected illness?

 

‘…Wait, hold on…’

 

That position originally belonged to the Madam. The official change of leadership had only happened because Ulrich, exercising his shareholder rights following Gwen’s death, had unilaterally pushed it through. The Madam’s opinion had not been considered in the process.

 

What if the Madam held resentment over that?

 

What if she wasn’t ready to step down from her role yet? From her perspective, she had been betrayed by the very child she had raised so well. While others might think she had passed on the leadership at an appropriate time, it might not have felt that way to her.

 

‘If that’s true…’

 

Suddenly, Victor’s shoulders stiffened. He heard someone approaching from around the corner.

 

He cautiously peeked out. The bedroom door opened, and the Madam emerged. She headed down the hallway in the opposite direction from where Victor was standing. He thought she might be going to see her son after hearing the news, but it wasn’t in the direction of Ulrich’s bedroom.

 

What was down that way again?

 

Damn it. His jumbled thoughts made it hard to think straight.

 

As he hid behind the corner, observing her movements, he cautiously followed her.

 

There was no real need to be this concerned, yet he felt compelled to follow her as if something had possessed him. Each time he was struck with a wave of self-reproach, asking himself, ‘What am I doing?’, the suspicious expression she had made in the bedroom quickly erased it.

 

After a short while, the Madam stopped in front of a door and entered.

‘Over there…’

 

Where was that again?

 

Although Victor spent most of his days here, he didn’t know every nook and cranny of the mansion. This was because the spaces he frequently visited were limited. Unless he had business that required him to visit Ulrich’s bedroom, he usually worked in the office attached to his private secretary’s space.

 

One thing was certain: even Victor, who had been with the household for a long time, had rarely ventured into this corner.

 

“Take Miss Osborne to the private room first.”

 

Private room. Now that he thought about it, that’s what she had said.

 

Was that private room over there?

 

“…Damn it.”

 

Leaning against the wall, Victor rubbed his face with his palm.

 

He had already heard the news that the lady would manage things herself. He should have just assumed Lisbell Osborne was staying there and left, but he couldn’t shake off his lingering doubts. He didn’t know why, but unless he confirmed with his own eyes what he was expecting to see, he felt he wouldn’t be able to sleep properly tonight.

 

Above all, if Ulrich regained consciousness soon, it was clear as day that he would search for that woman. It would be better to act now to avoid more trouble later. Having made up his mind, Victor hid in the corner and kept an eye on the closed door.

 

How many minutes had passed? The door opened again, and the lady stepped out into the hallway. Her secretary, whom Victor somewhat recognized, followed behind her. Since they had been talking when they came out, their voices softly echoed through the hallway.

 

“…Arrange it quickly.”

 

“Yes, Madam. Should we proceed with the purchase under a different name this time as well?”

 

“Yes.”

 

“I will look for a secluded villa as best as possible.”

 

A villa?

 

With his ears pricked, Victor caught the word. There was definitely something going on, he thought, turning his head the other way. The door from which the lady and her secretary had emerged was once again tightly shut, as if on alert.

 

Inside there…

 

He wanted to grab the handle and enter right away, but he couldn’t act so recklessly. If there was someone inside working for the lady, it would be problematic for both sides. There was nothing to gain from raising unnecessary suspicion at this point. Since he had caught onto something suspicious, he needed to be more cautious than usual.

 

After a brief hesitation, Victor turned away. He sought out the butler again and requested a serving of refreshments. Perhaps thinking that Victor was asking due to fatigue from several nights of staying up, the butler prepared it without a word.

 

Holding the tray, Victor crossed the hallway based on his earlier memory. Having roughly memorized the surrounding layout before leaving, he was able to return without much confusion.

 

Standing in front of the door, he took a deep breath. The lady hadn’t returned in the meantime, had she? By the time this vague unease surfaced, he had already knocked. Impulsiveness—it was a sign of how tense he really was. More importantly, there was no turning back now. Watching the door slowly open, Victor braced himself.

 

“What brings you here?”

 

He had been thinking about how to handle the situation if he encountered a familiar face, but in reality, he faced a stranger. Judging by the unfamiliarity of the face, it seemed the person was just a servant. Under the scrutinizing gaze of the servant, Victor remained nonchalant.

 

“The lady sent me on an errand.”

 

“Oh, yes.”

 

Just as Victor found the servant unfamiliar, the servant also didn’t seem to recognize him immediately and relaxed their guard. Perhaps judging by his neat appearance, the servant assumed he was the lady’s new secretary.

 

When the servant reached out to take the tray, Victor dodged slightly and said,

 

“It’s quite heavy. I’ll carry it inside myself.”

 

The servant blinked and then stepped aside, allowing him to enter. Victor flashed a polite smile and crossed the threshold.

 

The deeper he went into the bedroom, the more a peculiar tension swirled within him. He felt uneasy. An indescribable urge to flee, to throw away the tray and run, crept up on him.

 

The most unsettling part was not knowing the source of this feeling. However, a sense of duty as strong as his fear kept him rooted.

 

Nothing is going to happen. As long as he could confirm that the woman was living comfortably in luxury…

 

The bed, shrouded by curtains that made it feel like night even during the day, slowly came into view, and Victor’s feet froze in place. Perhaps it wasn’t just his feet—maybe his heart had stopped too.

 

“You can set the tray down here.”

 



 

“Secretary?”

 

Victor’s eyes gradually lost focus, as if unable to comprehend the reality before him.

 

What… is that?

 

The figure on the bed was grotesque, to put it simply.

 

Her limbs were tightly bound, unable to move, and her mouth was gagged with a towel, preventing her from ever closing it. The restraints that bound her in what appeared to be a torturous manner were alarming, but even more disturbing was the woman herself, who was tied up and lying there.

 

So what… exactly is that?

 

From his memories, Lisbell Osborne had grown increasingly emaciated—from the time she was brought as a hostage to the capital with her mother, to her disgraceful expulsion from the monastery where she had hidden, and finally to when she was captured and brought back.

 

It was like watching a living person wither away, much like how a flower wilts when deprived of water and nutrients. The reason why Victor had eventually advised her to give up was because of this.

 

At that time, he had only felt a vague discomfort. But now… it was as if he had seen something he should never have seen.

 

Is she… alive?

 

Doubt flared within him like wildfire, and soon it reached a dangerous intensity. That was problematic in itself. For if she were still alive in such a state, wouldn’t that be even more cruel?

 

Her eyes were sunken, her cheeks hollowed out as if someone had carved into them. The insides of her arms were covered with unidentified marks, like tiny dots, as if she had been repeatedly pricked by fine needles.

 

Her limbs were so thin that they reminded him of starvation, with skin shrunken around her bones, leaving her skeletal. The only part of her that was full of life, if it could even be called that, was her swollen belly. The grotesquely rounded shape looked so bizarre that it seemed like a parasitic life form growing inside her, devouring her from within.

 

It was beyond discomfort—it was revolting, to the point of inducing a dizzying sense of fear.

 

Unable to overcome the goosebumps creeping up from his feet, Victor took a step back. But then he noticed the servant watching him with a curious look, and he quickly composed his expression. He placed the tray on the table she had indicated.

 

What did I just see?

 

His fingertips trembled slightly as he withdrew them from the tray.

 

So, is she alive?

 

Shouldn’t I confirm whether she’s alive first?

 

Wasn’t the lady… the one who left Lisbell Osborne in such a state?

 

No, if the lady had personally set up such a closed-off space and visited in person, it meant she was directly managing her. In other words, the reason Lisbell had ended up like this was entirely due to the lady’s actions. The very same lady who had spoken of bonuses with such a noble demeanor and smiled so serenely was the one who had orchestrated this grotesque scene.

 

“…Secretary?”

 

Victor, who was suddenly struck by a severe headache, clutched his face. He heard the servant calling out to him with a puzzled tone, but this time he couldn’t respond immediately.

 

This is wrong. No matter what, this is…

 

It was as if he had finally confronted the truth he had been trying so hard to ignore. In other words, it was a feeling akin to guilt…

 

And Lisbell’s expression only intensified that feeling.

 

From the moment he entered the room, she had not reacted, despite the presence of another person. He thought she might be asleep.

 

But she was staring at the ceiling, her eyes open. She didn’t move, and it was hard to tell if she was even breathing. It was chilling to think that she might have already stopped breathing.

 

Just as her hands and feet were bound, it seemed her senses had also been cut off, as she didn’t appear to be functioning as a normal human being.

 

The empty expression on her face was haunting. Even in this bedroom, which was unusually bright for such a cruel scene, it seemed that if a little more light were taken away, she would soon turn into a skeleton and crumble into dust.

 

She looked like a wasteland—devoid of hope, crushed, and shattered, leaving no trace of will behind. The harsh marks on her body told the story of the many hardships she had endured over the two months she had been trapped here. Even worse, she was carrying the unwanted child of a man…

 Victor wiped his mouth, enduring his disgust. He closed his eyes tightly and opened them again to regain control over his frayed mind.

 

A baby.

 

It was the very thing that the lady desired, even if it meant driving Lisbell into such a miserable state. It was the presence inside that womb that sent chills down Victor’s spine.

 

The lady was trying to claim Ulrich’s baby.

 

Why?

 

The answer came more quickly than expected. It was a suspicion he had been mulling over even before he reached this room.

 

If the lady harbored significant resentment over being pushed out as the head of the family by a unilateral decision of the family council, she might see this as her perfect opportunity to reclaim her position by using Ulrich’s baby.

 

The woman carrying that baby was the one Ulrich had shown an unprecedented attachment to. Even if it meant a loss to him, if he wanted to bring the baby under his control, a deal could be struck at any time.

 

No, there was no need to go as far as involving the baby.

 

“Yes, ma’am. Should we proceed with the purchase under a different name this time?”

 

“Yes.”

 

“Understood. I will try to find the most secluded villa possible.”

 

The sudden talk of a villa… Once Victor grasped the hidden motive, it became clear. The lady intended to hide Lisbell, who had not yet reached her due date, in its entirety. Just like the last time, when she sent Ulrich away to a distant country under the pretext of a foreign business trip and discreetly abducted her.

 

“Is it you?”

 

He still remembered Ulrich’s reaction to him during that incident. The sudden push against the wall with a thud, the pain in the back of his head, and the suffocating grip on his collar that left him unable to feel anything else.

 

Ulrich’s true face, stripped of the facade of sociability and manners, was that intense. His usually gentle demeanor became so ferocious that even Victor felt his whole body bristle. The mere thought that it might happen again genuinely terrified him.

 

“Secretary, are you alright?”

 

“…Yes, I just got a bit dizzy.”

 

Victor ran a hand down his arm, trying to shake off the goosebumps that wouldn’t go away. He quickly organized the scattered thoughts that had been settling deep in his mind.

 

He took a deep breath and looked at the servant.

 

“I’ll be leaving now. But I have one request.”

 

“A request?”

 

“Please don’t inform the lady that I was here today.”

 

“…What?”

 

Seeing the servant’s puzzled expression, Victor calmly added as if to hammer the point home.

 

“This is an order from the master.”

 

The servant, initially muttering “the master…” as if in a daze, paled as she realized what this meant. Whether it was out of habit or not, she hesitated, then quickly bowed deeply.

 

“Yes, yes. I will do as you say.”

 

After ensuring the servant’s compliance with a stern gaze, Victor hurried out of the bedroom. The light streaming through the hallway’s skylights crossed his face. Despite the shimmering colors, Victor’s expression was exceedingly grim.

 

It felt as if he had been sentenced, making it impossible to remain in this ambiguous state any longer.

 

Throughout his time as Ulrich’s secretary, Victor had never failed to report the lady’s actions concerning Ulrich’s movements. But he had never hidden this from Ulrich either. His superior was certainly aware of it.

 

Though it seemed like he was merely playing both sides, Ulrich had never issued any warnings regarding this. He probably saw it as a necessary management of family affairs and accepted it without much concern.

 

Victor felt the same. He never thought his actions would harm Ulrich. The lady’s interference was probably just her way of ensuring her son wasn’t doing anything that could harm the Altahart family, and if any issues arose, she would step in before it was too late. In other words, helping the lady was also a way to help Ulrich.

 

But this double game could no longer continue.

 

When Ulrich woke up, the conflict between mother and son, bound by the same blood, would be inevitable. As long as Lisbell Osborne and her unborn child were involved, there was no way to avoid it.

 

This time, the mother and son were bound to clash.

 

If that happened, Victor would also need to choose a side. Whether it was this side or that side.

 

The two strings he had been balancing on were now unraveling in different directions, and to survive, he would have to climb onto one of them properly. Failing to do so would leave him in a precarious position, swept away in the middle.

 

“…Haa.”

 

Thinking of Lisbell, Victor rubbed his face with both hands. It felt like being trapped in a sticky nightmare that he couldn’t shake off, no matter how hard he tried.

 

He hadn’t intervened, even knowing that the lady had taken Lisbell into her grasp… because he thought, at least, it would be better for her than being with Ulrich.

 

After all, she hated him so much that she even fired a gun at him. He thought that being with the lady, whom she once trusted and relied on, would be better than staying with someone she despised.

 

Given his own reasoning, he also assumed that the lady wouldn’t treat her too harshly, considering she was carrying the family heir.

 

But if it meant this…

 

‘If she’s to live worse than livestock…’

 

Wouldn’t it be better for her to stay with Ulrich?

 

She had never lost so much vitality in her face, not even when she was with Ulrich. Just watching her made Victor feel as if he wanted to end his own life. The harsh treatment she was enduring was beyond words.

 

If this continued, she might give birth to the child in her womb, but Lisbell herself…

 

Following the lady’s orders would mean becoming a willing accomplice in her moral murder. Victor had no courage to endure such an intolerable level of discomfort.

 

“Call the doctor, right now.”

 

Victor instructed the servant as he headed towards Ulrich’s bedroom. While waiting after arriving first, the doctor appeared shortly after.

 

Watching the doctor approach the bed, Victor swallowed dryly. The issue of the heir was crucial for Ulrich as well, so if he regained consciousness, things could be resolved somehow. No matter what method was used, it would certainly be better than the sinful deeds the lady was currently committing.

 

There were two things Victor had to do now.

 

First, he must ensure that the lady’s side doesn’t discover that he has learned about Lisbell’s condition in that bedroom.

 

Second…

 

“Doctor, earlier you mentioned that the young master would regain consciousness within a short period.”

 

“Yes, that’s correct.”

 

“How many days do you estimate that to be? A rough timeline is fine.”

 

“Well… If we look at statistics, once an unconscious patient shows any signs of life, there’s a high chance they will fully wake up within a week.”

 

“A week…”

 

The problem wasn’t just waking up. He had been unconscious due to a gunshot wound. After regaining consciousness, he would need time to see if he could move properly, make decisions, and recover to a normal state.

 

“Doctor, do you want the young master to wake up?”

 

“What? Yes, of course. Why would you ask such an obvious question…”

 

Victor, arms crossed, watched the doctor before glancing at the bed behind him. After repeating the dry hand wipe he’d done countless times that day, he lifted his head with resolute determination.

 

“Then please follow the request I’m about to make without question.”

 

The second task was to conceal Ulrich’s recovery progress.

 

“If you do that, I promise to help you secure your position for life.”

 

Victor and the doctor talked for quite some time after that. The conversation, though quiet, ended with the doctor slowly nodding. He seemed to accept the situation more easily than expected, as he had no doubt that Ulrich, the current head of the family, would soon wake up.

 

After sending the doctor away, Victor, now alone, let out a sigh and turned to look at the bed. Ulrich’s face was as peaceful as it had been in the morning. The image of a horribly battered face kept overlaying on top of his, causing Victor to frown as he sat down on the chair beside the bed.

 

“Young master, this is no time to be sleeping peacefully…”

 

Words piled up on the tip of his tongue, wanting to question whether Ulrich realized how many lives were hanging by a thread because of him. As if to echo Victor’s frustration, Ulrich’s fingers on the blanket twitched ever so slightly.

“… then….”

 

“… so, let’s do it this way.”

 

“Understood… then, let’s proceed that way….”

 

Voices settled over her eardrums like dust.

 

Lisbell slowly lifted her eyelids.

 

The ceiling that she had grown so familiar with greeted her, so much so that she could probably draw it without even looking. The delicate engravings on it undulated like waves. Despite being aware that she was awake, her consciousness felt sluggish.

 

How many days… has it been…?

 

It felt like a day, or maybe a month, or even just an hour. Since losing the ability to move her body at will, her sense of time had unraveled, with days passing unpredictably.

 

Every time she woke up from a forcibly induced sleep, her memories were fragmented. Whenever she tried to recall the moments before falling asleep, a severe headache would squeeze her mind. It felt like dozens of needles were piercing her head simultaneously. At the same time, her stomach churned as if she had swallowed a tumultuous sea.

 

As she took a small breath through her mouth, which was held open by a cloth, she felt the inside of her throat dry and rough. Nausea had become a daily occurrence, and vomiting was naturally accompanied. Her throat had long been raw from expelling nothing but digestive fluids, as there was nothing substantial in her stomach.

 

Ah, so…

 

How many days…

 

What day is it today…

 

Her struggling thoughts were abruptly cut off. This had been happening for a while. It didn’t feel like her mind was working properly. Not just inefficiently, but as if it was malfunctioning, creaking before coming to a complete stop.

 

It was strange. Thinking is supposed to be as natural as breathing, a basic cognitive function of a person, yet she couldn’t do it consciously. It felt as if an invisible hand had ripped open her skull and was scratching her brain into a mess.

 

How many days…

 

Has it been…?

 

As her thoughts repeatedly circled around this, Lisbell’s eyes, bloodshot and clouded with dust, rolled.

 

It wasn’t an intentional action, but her mind suddenly froze. The sight of her own bulging belly startled her.

 

Ugh…

 

A faint sound escaped from her mouth, which was held shut by the cloth.

 

She sensed the two people who had been conversing by her side, as if she were a corpse, turning to look at her. But they quickly lost interest, perhaps considering her reaction just another futile resistance, and resumed their conversation.

 

Lisbell didn’t look at them either. She simply stared in shock at her belly, which seemed to have grown even larger.

 

Why is my belly like this?

 

Why is it so swollen?

 

It wasn’t like this before. It was flat.

 

What’s inside? What could be in there to make me like this…?

 

Her broken thoughts surfaced in terror and anxiety, only to fade away. A faint gunshot sound brushed past her ears. It was a distant echo, as if it came from beyond the closed window.

 

Where is that sound coming from…?

 

Her gaze wandered aimlessly. If she followed it, would she find the man? If so, she wanted to ask him immediately. Did you know that something like this is inside me? It was a ridiculous question. Of course, he knew. He knew everything and had even used it to concoct his sinister plans.

 

But where is Ulrich Altahart now?

 

Is he dead?

 

Did I kill him…?

 

I can’t remember… Then where am I? Why am I here? How many days have passed? Why is my belly like this? What’s inside that’s making it twitch? Is it okay for it to keep swelling like this? What if it bursts? Will I… die? Will I die too? But did Ulrich die? I can’t remember well…

 

Someone kept crushing her mind without permission. Her thoughts and concepts couldn’t stand firm, crumbling like sugar. Soon, even that stopped. As if the blood coursing through her veins had ceased, all her bodily functions came to a halt, and she experienced a strange paralysis.

 

Twitch.

 

Only one place moved.

 

Her stunned eyes fell once again. Twitch. The center of her swollen belly, so engorged that veins were protruding, bulged out.

 

“Huh…”

 

A gasp of shock escaped Lisbell’s mouth. Whatever was lurking inside seemed ready to tear through the thin skin and burst out at any moment. It was definitely thrashing about, damaging her organs beyond repair.

 

“Hah, huh… Hah.”

 

She had no idea what was happening. Her belly kept swelling. What had already been larger than her head was now growing like a cunning parasite that had taken over her body. Her already emaciated limbs grew weaker as if deprived of even minimal nourishment.

 

When she regained her senses, her vision was wildly spinning. No one was shaking her. Lisbell herself was thrashing about so violently that her whole body convulsed. Ahhhh, ah. The scream that couldn’t escape stretched out in her throat.

 

“…Get the doctor…!”

 

“A sedative! Hurry!”

 

The footsteps that had been at a distance suddenly rushed toward her. Her arms, weakened and reddened from rubbing against the restraints, were grabbed first, followed by her wildly flailing legs, which were pinned down onto the bed.

 

In the strange, unfamiliar scenery where even familiar things felt alien, something sharp glinted. The pointed end, which looked like a needle, soon found a vein in her arm and sank deep into it. Lisbell’s quivering eyes locked onto it before they slowly unfocused.

 

Come to think of it, yes.

 

Even right before fainting, there was a syringe like that….

 

Before she could fully finish the thought, Lisbell’s head slumped onto the pillow. She had been so terrified that tears, which she hadn’t even realized she had shed, pooled in her sunken eyes like little ponds. As she closed her eyes, the liquid traced a path down her hollowed cheeks.

 

Madame Altahart, who had been watching the commotion from a step away, clicked her tongue softly.

 

“It seems we’ve been using too many sedatives lately… Is the fetus in the womb going to be alright? I’m concerned that there might be other complications.”

 

“Of course, it’s best to avoid administering any drugs to a pregnant woman, Madame. However, given Miss Osborne’s condition, I believe leaving her as she is would be much more dangerous….”

 

The doctor, who was drenched in sweat, barely managed to calm Lisbell down. Although Madame’s expression was not pleased, she eventually nodded, perhaps realizing that there was no other way to resolve this situation than through the use of sedatives.

 

“How is Ulrich? I heard from Victor that he might wake up soon.”

 

“His condition is much the same. Although his vital signs are stable, he’s still not fully conscious….”

 

Victor had given the same answer when he visited her last night. The Madame stood silently for a moment before rising from her seat.

 

“I should see for myself.”

 

There were many things to tend to, keeping her busy, and since Victor, her loyal servant who had never disappointed her, had been by Ulrich’s side, she hadn’t been overly worried. But now it seemed time to check on him herself. She intended to confirm Ulrich’s condition with her own eyes.

 

She had been anxious about when her son, who had been in a coma from a gunshot wound, would wake up, but it wasn’t just parental affection that stirred within her.

 

Hatred existed alongside love.

 

How could he quietly convene a family council and commit such an audacious act behind her back? The shock she felt when she unexpectedly received a notice from her secretary about the council meeting while she was enjoying a rare, leisurely afternoon still weighed heavily on her heart. It was absurd to think that all of this was caused by her son’s obsession with a mere commoner woman.

 

Ulrich had always been the type who couldn’t rest until he repaid tenfold for anything done to him. He retaliated against her for abducting Lisbell Osborne to secure his engagement with the Schwaben family by dishonoring her and stripping her of her position as head of the family. It was, in essence, revenge.

 

Madame thought the situation, especially her unconsented demotion, was incredibly odd.

 

Because none of it made sense.

 

She couldn’t understand how Ulrich, after deposing her and assuming the position of head of the family, would be so intent on marrying a commoner woman, nor could she grasp why he would go so far as to humiliate his own mother just to possess that woman legally.

 

What is strange must be corrected.

 

The news of Lisbell’s pregnancy, revealed at such an opportune time, served as both a good means and a justification. Since it was clear who was responsible for Ulrich’s unreasonable rebellion, he would not be able to maintain any superiority in this conflict. As long as Lisbell Osborne and the child she carried were in her hands, Ulrich would have no chance.

“I will take care of it.”

 

The doctor, who was packing a bag filled with medical equipment, spoke.

 

The lady followed him toward Ulrich’s bedroom. The doctor, leading the way, knocked on the bedroom door three times.

 

“Madam?”

 

Victor, who was sitting at the desk working on documents, jumped up in surprise at the unexpected visit. The lady walked gracefully toward him and gestured for him to relax.

 

“No need to worry, Victor. I’m just here to check on Ulrich. I’ve been too busy to visit for too long.”

 

Unlike the bedroom earlier, which had been intermittently noisy due to Lisbell’s seizures, this room was as peaceful as a flowing stream. It was so quiet that it felt like stepping into an entirely separate space.

 

Ulrich lay beautifully in that warm and cozy atmosphere, unchanged since the last time the lady had visited.

 

“Still no news?”

 

“No, madam…”

 

“And any signs?”

 

“The doctor expects something soon.”

 

The lady, sitting on the edge of the bed, looked at her son’s face, which remained pure and unblemished despite his two months of illness.

 

She slowly reached out, brushing her fingers over his prominent eyes and gently caressing his cheeks. Despite her tender touch, his beautifully sculpted features showed no reaction.

 

This is all for you, Ulrich.

 

I would never do anything to harm the family. The results I achieve will ultimately benefit you. I have no doubt about that.

 

Before my utterly blind son wakes up completely and ruins everything again for that insignificant woman, I must push ahead with my plans without delay. The lady whispered to herself as she withdrew her hand from the face she had delicately crafted like a masterpiece.

 

“You need to get up soon.”

 

“He will, soon.”

 

“Victor, I owe you a debt I can never repay.”

 

“There’s no need to say that, madam.”

 

The lady smiled kindly at Victor, who only ever said things that pleased her, and said she would be leaving. Victor bowed deeply to her as she walked away.

 

The lady, who had finished her business and seemed ready to leave through the door Victor had opened, stopped suddenly. In the next moment, she turned her head and looked back at the bed.

 

“…Madam?”

 

Victor cautiously called out, noticing her action. The lady let out a short gasp, as if she had been unconscious of her movement until she heard his voice. Smiling to reassure him, she then left the bedroom.

 

Click.

 

The door closed, and silence fell heavily. The lady had left, but Victor still had no intention of sitting down. Watching the stillness beyond the door, Victor’s head slowly turned.

 

At that moment, there was a response from the previously quiet bed.

 

“Hmm… I don’t remember anything because I’ve been asleep all this time…”

 

A man sat up, pushing off the covers, and slowly tilted his head from side to side. His muscles made cracking sounds as they stretched, stiff from lying down for so long. Despite the intimidating nature of the action, his platinum hair shimmering in the sunlight and his even more dazzling features softened any menacing impression.

 

“Seeing my mother react like that, I must have really been on the brink of death.”

 

“You endured well.”

 

“I almost laughed because it tickled.”

 

As if to display the smile he had held back while his mother touched his face, Ulrich pulled his lips into a grin, then slowly lowered the hand massaging his neck.

 

“So…”

 

The smile on the handsome man’s face began to fade.

 

“Tell me again. What did you say about Lisbell’s condition?”

 



 

“Administer a moderate dose of the sedative today.”

 

“Madam, by ‘moderate’ you mean…?”

 

The sound of a quiet conversation at her bedside reached Lisbell’s consciousness like a drop of water.

 

Though faintly aware, she had no strength to open her eyes, and given that she knew any effort would likely only reveal an unpleasant situation, she chose not to bother.

 

“As long as she doesn’t wake up during the transfer to the villa, it’ll be fine. She’s asleep now anyway.”

 

“Then should I administer half the usual dose?”

 

“Less than that… A third should suffice.”

 

Perhaps believing she had not yet woken, the conversation continued without disruption. One of the two presences that had been lingering like invisible stains above her closed eyelids vanished. The other remained, moving around as if preparing something.

 

At that point, Lisbell slowly opened her eyes, though only slightly, so that to someone looking down from above, it would still seem as though her eyes were closed.

 

Something caught her eye in the narrow field of vision. It was the syringe being handled by the servant.

 

Again…

 

Why, again…

 

“You just need to ensure she doesn’t wake during the transfer to the villa.”

 

The lady’s request echoed sluggishly in her mind. Transfer to the villa. After a slow process of piecing together the words, Lisbell finally understood what it meant.

 

Transfer… Where? Me?

 

The villa?

 

Where is that? Isn’t this the villa? Marnia Villa? Or is it the capital? The bright light makes it feel like the small room in the monastery… No, no…. Where is the villa…? I don’t know. I don’t know, but I don’t want to go.

 

Instinctively, she clenched her palms. Though she knew her hands were bound by ropes that made it nearly impossible to move, she had no choice but to try something. So, when she felt the slack in the ropes loosen just enough to pull out her wrists, she flinched instead.

 

The servant’s gaze pierced her face. He seemed to be checking whether she had awoken due to the sudden movement. When she remained still, he concluded that she had merely shifted in her sleep and resumed his task.

 

Lisbell’s thumb, hidden inside the pillow, twitched. Her eyelids, which had only been open as wide as her fingernail, opened halfway. She stared at the servant’s hands handling the syringe with eyes darker than those of a corpse.

 

Meanwhile, the lady, as always maintaining a certain distance, watched the situation unfold from afar.

 

From where she sat, she couldn’t clearly see Lisbell on the bed, as her view was obstructed by the servant’s back. Well, even if she woke up late, there was a sedative prepared, and her hands and feet were tied, so there wouldn’t be any major issues.

 

After returning from Ulrich’s bedroom, Lady Altahart hurried to push forward with the plan to move Lisbell to a new villa. She was in a rush to carry it out before Ulrich regained consciousness.

 

All that remained was to ensure that Lisbell didn’t have any seizures during the transfer to the villa by putting her to sleep peacefully. Then, she only needed to endure until Lisbell gave birth.

 

Everything was falling into place. As the lady observed this smooth process, she felt that the dissonance she had sensed earlier, like a cog turning backward, was being resolved one by one. It was the return to the original state she had longed for. The lady quietly smiled to herself.

 

“Madam…!”

 

The door suddenly burst open without a knock.

 

It was the secretary in charge of handling the villa arrangements. Usually calm, he hurried over and whispered in the lady’s ear.

 

“It seems it will be difficult to move Miss Osborne today. An unexpected issue has arisen in the villa acquisition process….”

 

“An issue?”

 

“Yes, and the area leading to the villa will be temporarily restricted today due to a military matter.”

 

“Restricted…?”

 

“If that area is blocked, we’ll have to take a detour, which will delay the journey. I’m not sure Miss Osborne’s condition can withstand that….”

 

It was as if someone had orchestrated these simultaneous disruptions. Everything had been going so smoothly just moments ago. The calm expression on the lady’s face subtly darkened. It was hard to ignore the significant sense of unease. She tapped the armrest of the chair and asked,

 

“Did you confirm which department is handling the restriction?”

 

“Yes, it’s the Miller unit.”

 

“Who’s the commanding officer?”

 

“Colonel Craxon.”

 

The lady sighed softly. Colonel Craxon was one of the connections Ulrich had carefully cultivated. That he had stepped in at such an unforeseen moment led the lady closer to a conclusion she had feared. However, even if that were the case, there was an undeniable mystery.

 

“Then why did Victor….”

 

The lady, murmuring quietly, closed her eyes briefly and then opened them.

 

So, he betrayed me.

 

Victor has betrayed me and sided with Ulrich…

 

“Kyahhh!”

 

A sharp scream suddenly echoed from far away.

 The Madam and the secretary hurriedly turned to look at the bed. At the same time, the syringe embedded in the servant’s hand was abruptly yanked upward. Blood began to stream out of the small puncture wound. The servant, who had fallen backward onto her buttocks, groaned and clutched her hand in pain.

 

And Lisbell, holding the syringe, pointed its blood-soaked needle towards her own neck.

 

The Madam quickly grasped the situation. It seemed that the rope binding Lisbell’s arms had either come loose or she had somehow untied it. Then, she had snatched the syringe aimed at her and stabbed it into the servant’s hand.

 

While she understood the sequence of events, the realization only made her head throb more. It was already overwhelming to deal with external obstacles, but now problems were arising even in this bedroom. And at such a critical moment.

 

“Miss Osborne.”

 

Lisbell, who had staggered back until she was leaning against the wall, fumbled with the towel in her mouth with the hand not holding the syringe. She tugged at the tightly knotted fabric with her fingers, and it slowly unraveled.

 

“Don’t…”

 

Lisbell managed to gasp out a breath, almost like a scream.

 

“Don’t… come closer…”

 

Her voice, weak from the dryness of her throat, sounded like pieces of metal scraping together.

 

The Madam, who had been approaching the bed, paused at the sound.

 

Lisbell kept her eyes fixed on her while moving her hands. One hand was still poised to pierce her neck with the syringe at any moment, while the other hand worked to untie the rope binding her ankles. It was difficult, as her fingers lacked strength and her entire hand was trembling due to malnutrition.

 

“If you come closer, I’ll…”

 

Cough!

 

She couldn’t finish her sentence. Her throat, dry and cracked from dehydration, felt like it was tearing apart with each breath. As her head shook from coughing, the syringe dangerously pricked her neck. A fresh drop of blood formed at the tip and trickled down.

 

“Okay. I won’t come any closer. Just calm down, Miss Osborne. Calm down and put down that dangerous thing.”

 

Exhausted from a few coughs, Lisbell looked at the Madam with a pale face, as if she might faint at any moment. As the standoff dragged on, the secretary behind her flinched. Lisbell’s blurred vision darted beyond her shoulder, and she quickly drew the syringe closer to her neck. The Madam clicked her tongue softly and turned to the others.

 

“Everyone, stay back.”

 

“But, Madam…”

 

“Do not provoke Miss Osborne any further.”

 

Judging by how she was lashing out like this, she might actually stab a vital spot in a fit of rage. If that happened, everything they had worked to achieve would be in vain. Her hopes, and the order that was finally starting to take shape, would all slip through her fingers like sand.

 

That had to be prevented. She couldn’t let Lisbell Osborne die just yet. Even if it meant a meaningless death, it had to be after every last bit of use had been wrung out of her.

 

“Talk to me, Miss Osborne. Didn’t you say you wanted to speak with me before?”

 

Having finally untied the rope around her ankles, Lisbell pressed herself even harder against the wall, as if the idea of being crushed to death by the wall was more comforting than getting closer to them.

 

Lisbell wrapped her bruised ankles inward and rubbed her eyes with one hand. Her vision kept doubling and tripling before merging into one again. Her head throbbed as if someone was hitting it with a blunt object. Even in the midst of all this, the awareness of the round belly she was trying not to look at was driving her insane.

 

“Madam, I…”

 

She was overcome with sorrow at the realization that there was no one on her side in this place. Lisbell had always been alone in this mansion.

 

Betrayed by Altahart, and while opposing Altahart, no one had ever taken her side. Even though it was only natural, she couldn’t shake the loneliness that made her feel like the entire world was against her.

 

Even now, she felt the same. If she let her guard down for even a moment, she feared her hands and feet would be bound again, and she’d be thrown back onto the bed. Then she would be helplessly robbed of her blood and flesh by the grotesque life curled up inside her.

 

Despite her inner cries to be rid of it, the wretched thing stubbornly clung to her. It had to be that man’s seed. Its very existence and breath were so loathsome and repulsive that she wished it would rot away inside her, such a monstrous thing.

 

If she was taken by the Madam now, that monster would come into the world. That must not happen. To prevent that, she had to end it here somehow.

 

But in her current weakened state, defeating him seemed impossible with the Madam’s people constantly watching for an opportunity behind her. The figures looming in her hazy vision seemed ready to pounce on her at any moment.

 

So that was why.

 

“Leave, all of you…”

 

Everyone except the Madam had to leave.

 

The Madam, who understood the short, barely coherent command, turned back to the others.

 

“Everyone, leave.”

 

“Madam…!”

 

The secretary, who had been anxiously pacing behind her, approached and whispered urgently.

 

“It’s too dangerous.”

 

“You need to go handle the villa issue immediately. The problem isn’t just here, after all.”

 

“But…”

 

“And look at Miss Osborne’s condition.”

 

Following the Madam’s instructions, the secretary glanced at the bed. It became clear what the Madam was implying.

 

She had spoken of the danger, but her own claim now seemed absurd, as the figure on the bed appeared extremely fragile. If she had to rely on threatening herself with a syringe, it meant she didn’t even have the strength to attack anyone else. She had been reduced to such a weakened state.

 

“Leave two people outside the door. If something happens, I’ll scream, and they can come in immediately.”

 

“…Yes, Madam.”

 

Reluctantly, the secretary withdrew, acknowledging that while this situation was critical, the villa issue couldn’t be ignored either. Even if they managed to take Lisbell out of here, the process could become complicated if the villa situation wasn’t resolved.

 

The secretary left the bedroom with the servants, closing the door behind them.

 

In the silence that fell over the room with only the two of them remaining, the Madam took a step closer to Lisbell.

 

“Miss Osborne, put that down.”

 



 

“It seems you have misunderstood something about me. I am not trying to put you in danger.”

 

Lisbell blinked slowly. What nonsense is she talking about? If that were the case, why had she been subjected to such repeated torment for what felt like an eternity?

 

“In fact, I’m going out of my way to save you. Do you really not see that?”

 

I don’t know. I don’t know… I don’t know.

 

Lisbell shook her head frantically, confused. As she did, the syringe scraped against her neck, leaving shallow scratches on her delicate skin. Blood quickly began to spread across her neck. The Madam, frowning at the sight, hurriedly spoke.

 

“Ulrich has woken up.”

 

Lisbell’s movements froze at the words.

 

Her eyes, which had been glaring at the approaching woman, became hollow.

 

“What…?”

 

“I said Ulrich has woken up.”

 



 

“My son, the one you shot and left for dead.”

 

“No…”

 



 

“No… No…”

 

He was already dead, so how could he still be alive? I killed him. I, personally, ended his life.

 

“That man, he’s already dead…”

 

“He’s alive.”

 

“I…”

 

“Ulrich is alive, Miss Osborne.”

 



 

“And now that he’s awake, he will surely come looking for you.”

 

Lisbell’s fingers tightened around the syringe. She trembled quietly, and the Madam, noticing this, narrowed her eyes.

 

“Do you think someone as stubborn as he is will leave alone the person who tried to kill him?”

 



 

“If you stay with my son, you will be in even greater danger than you are now.”

 

“Lisbell, this is what happens when someone as naive as you thinks too much.”

 

“So come with me.”

 

“You only make things worse.”

 

“I can protect you.”

 

“In times like this, not thinking at all can be a solution.”

 

Hah.

 

Lisbell felt like she was going mad from the whispers of the two demons echoing in her mind. One was urging her to choose, while the other was urging her to give up. She felt as if she were being crushed to dust between two immovable cliffs.

 

That wretched Altahart.

 

He had already worn her down to a smooth pebble, but it wasn’t enough for him—he wanted to grind her into sand.


Lisbell curled up even tighter.

 

In an instant, the tension that had been holding her mind together snapped. She was too exhausted to continue thinking. The hand that had been gripping the syringe slowly dropped. The woman who had been standing at a distance began to approach the bed.

 

“You didn’t want to be by my son’s side, did you?”

 

Step by step, closer.

 

“You were waiting for Ulrich to lose interest.”

 

Closer still…

 

“You told me that, didn’t you, Miss Osborne?”

 

Smack—the woman struck Lisbell’s hand. The syringe she had been holding flew out of her grasp and shattered on the floor.

 

“Now, Miss Osborne. You’re coming with me.”

 

Lisbell stared at the outstretched hand before her. Just days ago, this woman’s hand had seemed so hateful, but now her mind was blank. As she gave up on thinking, everything began to feel peaceful.

 

Perhaps, just as the man had said, it might actually be true. Maybe she had been overwhelming herself with too many thoughts, bringing unnecessary suffering upon herself.

 

As she refused to think, her thoughts became extreme and simplistic. Ulrich, whom she had nearly killed, had miraculously survived. He had awoken from his near-death state, and although he might inflict even greater pain upon her as revenge, the woman was offering to protect her from that—so she should follow her immediately.

 

As if hypnotized, Lisbell grasped the woman’s hand. The woman helped her down from the bed. Even just placing one foot on the floor felt as heavy as if the ground was splitting beneath her.

 

‘Ah…?’

 

It wasn’t due to her severely weakened state, nor was it the realization of whose hand she was holding.

 

It was the oppressive weight inside her stomach, crushing her as if it would drag her into the ground…

 

“You can atone by giving birth to the baby inside you.”

 

“Miss Osborne, think of it this way. We are willing to overlook your heinous crime in exchange for the birth of the baby inside you.”

 

Ah…

 

“Remember one thing. The fetus inside you is more important to me than the mother.”

 

So this hand…

 

“It means I don’t care what happens to the mother as long as the fetus survives.”

 

…was one that would allow this relentless creature to consume her.

 

It was foolish to have shown even a moment of trust. After all, the woman was still an Altahart. Cruel, selfish, power-hungry people. Corrupt, toxic, and unhealthy beings.

 

She was sick of it all.

 

Lisbell shook off the woman’s hand that was gripping her. But the hand came back like a claw, stronger than before, with a force that was uncharacteristic of a noble lady. It was clear that she intended to drag her out of there at all costs. Lisbell, feeling overwhelmed by the blatant malice of the misfortune that clung to her like a shadow, mustered all her remaining strength to push the woman away.

 

Thud!

 

With a heavy thump, the woman fell back, hitting her head hard on the edge of a table, collapsing immediately.

 

“…Ma’am…”

 

With a gasp, Lisbell, who was already disoriented from her labored breathing, sank to the floor. The woman, who had slipped under the table, lay there motionless.

 

“Ma’am…?”

 

A deeply unsettling smell suddenly filled the air. It was as if the scent that had been clinging to her neck was being overpoweringly layered over by something else. The source was the blood that began to pool around the woman’s head.

 

Memories of the past superimposed themselves. A man who had fallen after being hit by a vase… or was it a woman? No, a man? Who was it? Who…? Overwhelmed by the sharp pain of a sudden migraine, Lisbell clutched the side of her head, groaning.

 

She stared straight ahead, her eyes wide in disbelief.

 

“Ma’am…”

 

Lisbell began crawling toward the table.

 

“Get… get up…”

 

Her skirt, which clung to her knees, became stained red. Lisbell recoiled in terror, her eyes wide with fear.

 

“Why aren’t… aren’t you getting up, gasp, why aren’t you…?”

 

The overpowering smell of blood stabbed at her insides. Thud, thud, thud. Her heart, which had been racing for days, responded as if it was finally about to burst. Gasp, gasp. Her breathing became increasingly labored. It felt as if someone was gripping her lungs and squeezing them from the very depths.

 

“Get up, get up…! Get up! Get up, gasp…!”

 

Cough, choke. A fit of coughing erupted from her. She suddenly felt nauseous. Turning her head, Lisbell vomited bile and then desperately crawled, her eyes rolling in panic as she clung to the floor. The hand she used to scrape the carpet was already soaked with blood.

 

It wasn’t just her hand, though.

 

Here, there… everywhere.

 

She stared down in despair at her hands, which were so red they hid her natural skin color. Her head tilted back, her eyes rolling up toward the ceiling, where no blue sky was visible.

 

Dead…?

 

Did I kill someone… again…?

 

Why does this keep happening? All I wanted was freedom. Not something I didn’t have, but something that was originally mine. Something that belonged to me, not something stolen by force. How could the process of reclaiming it be so difficult and cruel?

 

How far do I have to fall?

 

How deep must I sink before this ends?

 

Knock, knock.

 

A knock came at the door, an unwelcome intrusion.

 

“Gasp…”

 

Lisbell’s dry, cracked lips parted. She hesitated as she glanced toward the door.

 

Knock, knock.

 

The knock came again, as if asking if something was wrong inside.

 

In that instant, memories struck her like lightning. She had shot someone before, and it had been discovered. She had been forcibly confined in a small room after her unwanted pregnancy was exposed, and no matter how much she pleaded, she had never been allowed to leave.

 

This time would be no different. Someone would capture her alive, interrogate her about the woman, and lock her up until she had performed the penance they deemed necessary, all while tormenting her mercilessly.

 

As soon as the realization struck, Lisbell scrambled to crawl away. Her bony knees knocked loudly against the floor as she moved. Her panicked gaze darted around the room.

 

Soon, she spotted a side table against the wall.

 

She wriggled her way under the table, as if wanting to erase her existence from this world, curling up as tightly as possible. Her stomach tightened with pain, but she didn’t care. She hadn’t wanted this child in the first place. If the pressure could make it go away, she would welcome it.

 

Creak.

 

The knocking ceased after only two knocks.

 

The door opened with a faint creak. From beneath the tablecloth, the world looked small and confined, as if more than half of it had been cut away. Lisbell pressed her back against the wall, trying to disappear into the shadows so that no one could reach her, no matter how close they got.

 

She heard footsteps approaching. Lisbell’s blurred vision refused to focus on one spot, her eyes rolling around in a daze. Her hands, clasped around her knees, trembled violently. The pain in her stomach was barely noticeable amidst the intense, spreading tension in her body.

 

The sound of the footsteps continued, flowing like water, then paused for a moment, and then resumed.

 

Lisbell knew exactly where the footsteps had stopped. It was near the woman, who had fallen to the floor, bleeding profusely. The smell of blood became so overpowering that it made her nose sting.

 

Soon, the footsteps grew louder. Lisbell squeezed her eyes shut, then slowly opened them again. She saw the tip of a shoe sticking out from under the tablecloth. The glossy black surface shone like a bright moonlit night.

 

As she became fixated on the sight, the tablecloth was abruptly lifted.

 

Blinding light burst in, almost violently intense. Lisbell instinctively buried her head in her knees, then slowly raised her face.

 

The man who had lifted the cloth bent down to look under the table.

 

Whether it was because of a sudden gust of wind or the man’s hurried movement, his brilliant platinum blonde hair fluttered before her eyes.

 

“Boo.”

 



 

“What are you doing there?”

Lisbell stood dazed, as if she had just encountered someone she never thought she’d see again.

 

But only for a moment. As she gradually regained her senses, she noticed Ulrich’s immaculate appearance, so different from hers. No matter how chaotic her situation was, just like the sky and earth could never switch places, the stark contrast between her disheveled figure, smeared with bloodstains, and Ulrich’s clean-cut suit became apparent.

 

It was more accurate to call it a sense of danger.

 

“I-I didn’t do it…”

 

If he was the one she sensed approaching, he would have already seen the fallen woman on his way here. If so, then the reason he came looking for her, the reason he lifted the tablecloth and peered underneath…

 

“It wasn’t me… I didn’t do it!”

 



 

“Sh-she, the madam, she tried to take me, without my consent, I didn’t want to go, and so… I didn’t… I swear I didn’t!”

 

Her words tumbled out in disarray. Lisbell clutched her head, shaking it violently. She couldn’t make sense of anything, but instinctively, she continued to defend herself. It wasn’t my fault. It wasn’t my fault. It wasn’t my fault…

 

“Lisbell.”

 

For a moment, her breath caught in her throat. It was when Ulrich softly called her name.

 

“Come here.”

 

Lisbell, who had been spewing words in a fevered frenzy like a sickness she couldn’t control, bit the inside of her cheek. Horrified, she recoiled even further.

 

“It’s alright.”

 

Ulrich reached his hand toward her.

 

Lisbell swallowed a ragged breath and shook her head even more vigorously. As soon as her legs gave out, causing her to fall toward him, she hastily pulled herself back in fear.

 

Ulrich’s eyes sharpened slightly at this.

 

“Come here.”

 



 

“I said come here.”

 

His voice dropped, as if frustrated by the situation not going as he wished. It felt like a demand that lashed at her, pushing her forward. Her mind gave up trying to think, and all that remained was a visceral resistance.

 

Lisbell screamed, her voice tight in her throat.

 

“You… you’re going to make me have it too…”

 



 

“This baby… you’re going to make me give birth to this wretched thing too!”

 



 

“You’re planning to tear open my stomach and pull it out, aren’t you?!”

 

That was impossible. If that happened, this being would become a detestable link to the man she loathed more than anything, a bond that could never be severed from this family. Like shackles, like chains, like a black necktie…

 

No, she couldn’t let it happen. She didn’t want to give birth to death. The despair she had felt, like a snuffed-out ember, suddenly rekindled.

 

Lisbell swallowed her sobs and hit her stomach. She hated the solid lump that had grown inside her. If she could make it disappear by striking it, she would hurt herself over and over. Her entire body felt unbearably heavy. It felt like she was carrying a fruit too large to bear in the shell of her own life.

 

“You don’t have to.”

 

Lisbell’s fists, raised high enough to almost touch the ceiling, hesitated.

 

Lies.

 

There was no way.

 

Given the nature of his family, the issue of heirs was an inevitable matter. The fact that he had rushed from Marnia to the capital, the fact that the madam had staked her life on protecting the child while imprisoning her—everything was tied to that.

 

Ulrich Altahart surely knew this. He wouldn’t pretend otherwise. This was just a scheme, a ruse, a ploy to entrap her once again and watch her squirm in discomfort.

 

After all, hadn’t he expressed a desire for this before? That he wanted her to carry his child.

 

So there was no way he would abandon the child now.

 

“If that’s what you want.”

 

Lisbell’s tearful gaze focused on the man in front of her. He crouched, peering under the table, his large frame hunched over.

 

Ulrich still hadn’t withdrawn his outstretched hand.

 

“I’ll take care of it for you.”

 



 

“You don’t trust me, do you?”

 

He laughed.

 

The curve of his eyes, the slight lift of his lips—it was as if his gentle expression was trying to convey some meaning to her. Even before he spoke, Lisbell could feel his intentions piercing her mind.

 

Thoughts…

 

“If you just come out, I’ll do whatever you want, Lisbell.”

 

…were clear.

 

“Okay?”

 

But…

 

“So, come out.”

 

I can’t believe him.

 

This man is as cunning as a snake.

 

“But…”

 

Then why were her lips parting so weakly?

 

“Somehow.”

 

His answer to her cautious question was deceptively simple.

 

Lisbell gazed at him with eyes that seemed to swallow the abyss. She wondered if he truly understood what she wanted at this very moment.

 

She wanted to be anywhere but here. She wanted him to understand that while she had harmed the madam, it was never her intention to kill. She didn’t want to atone, and more than anything, she wanted to rid herself of this unbearable weight in her belly immediately.

 

Such complicated desires—he said he would grant them all if she just came out from under the table.

 

It was laughable to think she would fall for it.

 

Yet, the memories, like pebbles, kept pulling her attention back to him.

 

“Will you kiss me? If you do, I’ll even prepare clothes for tomorrow and arrange a car to take you to the hospital.”

 

“Fine. You even spread your expensive legs for me.”

 

Requests, demands, and the resulting exchange—it had always followed this sequence. Ulrich had surprisingly honored his end of the deal every time. Whenever she complied, he would respond accordingly.

 

So, if she obeyed him this time…

 

Perhaps this time too…

 

The strength in the arms wrapped around her knees began to loosen. Her crouched legs settled on the floor. Ulrich was still reaching out his hand toward her. Lisbell stared at it. The hand that triggered her trauma, the one that humiliated her even in a casual chess game, had once defeated her.

 

The moment before she shot him came to mind.

 

That piercing realization that she could never beat this man.

 

The overwhelming sense of despair had briefly flipped into something else. If this monstrous man could return alive, despite being shot, maybe he could defeat the madam—someone she couldn’t compete with—and completely rid her of this cursed burden in her belly.

 

If it were him, if it were Ulrich Altahart, perhaps he could do it.

 

This man, who had no sense of humanity or ethics.

 

She had clearly lost her mind. Crawling toward Ulrich Altahart, what kind of contradiction was that?

 

Knowing this, she couldn’t stop herself. A mental axe kept chopping away at her thoughts, breaking them before they could take shape. The shattered pieces of her mind clattered around in her skull, sharp like someone’s scornful laughter, tearing her apart from head to toe.

 

As soon as she crossed a certain boundary, a flood of light poured in violently. She felt faint, and when her wrist was seized, her body was dragged out from under the table.

 

Ulrich immediately lifted her into his arms, clicking his tongue.

 

“You’re in bad shape.”

 



 

“Worse than I thought.”

 

He turned his head slightly, looking somewhere. Even in her dazed state, Lisbell quickly realized what his gaze was directed at. A desperate breath escaped her chest. Suddenly, everything turned red. Her mind was drenched in blood.

 

“H-here…”

 

“Hmm?”

 

“I don’t want…”

 



 

“I don’t want to be here…”

 

The iron scent wouldn’t leave. It was strong enough to sting her nose. The stench exposed her fatal mistake.

 

With trembling hands, Lisbell shook as if she were a sinner before the cross. I don’t want to be here, I don’t want to be here, I don’t want to be here… She muttered over and over, and Ulrich’s large hand gripped the back of her head, pressing her into his chest.

 

Her sunken eyes and gaunt cheeks buried into his shoulder.

 

Lisbell’s trembling hand clung to his chest. Blood smeared over his white shirt in a gruesome pattern.

 

Yet, Ulrich walked steadily, as if it were nothing. For a brief moment, his footsteps squelched as he walked. Even with her eyes closed, she could tell where he was headed.

 

Ah…

 

A soft sigh escaped from between her lips.

 

This man was truly… horrifying. The coldness with which he ignored his mother, who lay bleeding just a few steps away, was beyond belief.

 

Lisbell, despite feeling that coldness, could only bury her face deeper into his chest. She couldn’t deny that his indifference provided her with comfort.

 

As if saying that what she had done wasn’t worth the fuss.

 

As if shielding her despair, stained with blood, from the entire world.

 

His pure malice, ironically, concealed her.

 

An unspeakably uncomfortable sense of peace spread through her heart like a disease.

Ulrich opened the door and gestured inward.

 

Victor, who had been waiting outside, entered as though expecting the call, but immediately froze at the sight of the deep red pool on the floor. His face twisted in anguish as he ran a hand down his face, and he signaled a few of the servants to enter the bedroom.

 

While Victor tidied up the room, Ulrich walked out with steady steps. Before leaving, he gave a single order.

 

“I’ll be going to the hotel. Get the car ready.”

 



 

Alstad Hotel.

 

This chain hotel, directly owned by the Altahart family, was currently divided into two branches operating within Laurent.

 

The first branch of Alstad Hotel, built with a large initial capital investment, was located near the Alstad Department Store, also owned by the family. It was a shining example of the Altahart family’s successful business strategy of upgrading inns.

 

The second branch, constructed later, proudly stood in the new downtown area, which was flourishing with development thanks to the construction of a new government building. Unlike the first branch, the second branch operated strictly on a reservation basis, catering exclusively to nobles or high-ranking officials with connections to the family. As a result, despite its grand opening, the second branch was relatively quiet, making it ideal for a private and discreet stay.

 

Although the two hotels differed in business strategy, their internal decor also varied distinctly. Each branch had its own symbolic flower, chosen to create a luxurious yet light atmosphere. In the case of the first branch, it was the pale pink crabapple blossom.

 

The lobby, lounge, dining room, and terrace were tastefully decorated with subtle pink hues, matching the color of the symbolic flower. Artificial crabapple blossoms, which never withered, adorned dining tables, the reception desk, and even the central fountain, adding a touch of elegance that never faded with the seasons.

 

While the first branch exuded a fresh and vibrant feeling, the second branch was dominated by the calm but not overly somber presence of the purple cineraria.

 

Though the management styles differed, the two hotels were unmistakably branches of the same enterprise, as reflected in their identical interior designs. Where the crabapple blossoms decorated the first branch, the cineraria filled the same spots in the second branch.

 

The same could be said of the tea table in the social room, where fragrant tea was placed.

 

Artificial cineraria flowers, lightly placed in a wave-shaped vase, were darkening in the dim light. As Ulrich’s eyes focused on the flowers, he sensed someone approaching from behind.

 

“Sir.”

 

Of course, it was Victor.

 

Victor whispered softly into Ulrich’s ear from behind. Ulrich’s expression was unreadable, making it impossible for onlookers to guess the content of the report. From start to finish, he maintained the same composed posture, and only when Victor finished the report and stepped back did Ulrich’s lips curve into a smooth smile.

 

“My apologies for interrupting the pleasant mood. Something urgent has come up, and I must leave.”

 

Ulrich excused himself with practiced manners and promised to meet again another time before turning on his heels.

 

As he stepped into the lobby, the brilliant light from the chandelier above cascaded down, illuminating the marble floor and the carpeted staircase.

 

Ulrich’s black shoes glided smoothly over the floor, accompanied by Victor’s footsteps. The sound of their two pairs of shoes echoed in harmony as they climbed the long staircase.

 

The atmosphere grew colder as they approached a private area, where only one room existed per floor, heightening the already tense silence.

 

But the stillness was quickly broken. As soon as Ulrich grasped the sleek, gold-rimmed handle and opened the door, there was a loud crash.

 

Ulrich’s gaze dropped. The entryway was already a mess. Shattered glass from a picture frame and a sofa cushion, inexplicably displaced, lay at his feet.

 

He calmly stepped over the debris as he entered the room. Sunlight flooded the spacious room, designed to provide guests with a picturesque view from every window. Every room in the hotel was bathed in the same pristine light, tailored to satisfy even the most discerning guests.

 

Standing in the light was a frail figure.

 

Her body was still thin, so thin that it seemed like she would feel cold regardless of the season. Her skinny frame, fragile in a white negligee, appeared weak, trembling with irregular, harsh breaths. The tips of her bloodstained fingers, grasping at broken objects without fear, came into focus.

 

As the object in her hand flew towards the wall with a loud crash, Ulrich blinked slowly. Watching her stumble and fall, he walked over.

 

“Lisbell.”

 

He softly called her name and embraced her as she collapsed. Blood began to soak into the sleeve of his white shirt as Lisbell clung tightly to his arm.

 

“When… When will it go away…?”

 

Lisbell seemed unaware of who she was clinging to, her eyes wide and frantic. Her pale, ashen face and wide-open pupils, darting about aimlessly, signaled her confusion.

 

“It keeps growing….”

 



 

“It keeps growing! It won’t stop! It won’t stop! Aaaah!”

 

Lisbell screamed, clutching her head as she crumbled in his arms. Her voice, already hoarse from repeated outbursts, was rough and frayed, like a rag wrung dry.

 

Despite her loud, sharp cries, Ulrich’s expression remained calm, and he held her firmly.

 

“Lisbell.”

 

At the sound of her name, Lisbell lifted her head sharply.

 

A glimmer of light entered her pupils. Her fragile form seemed to struggle even with the brightness that reached her.

 

“You… You can do it, can’t you…?”

 



 

“You promised… You said you would make it stop somehow! You promised!”

 

Her blood-soaked fingers gripped his arm tightly, digging her nails into his skin through the fabric.

 

Despite her outburst, Ulrich showed no sign of pushing her away. He continued to watch her with calm, unwavering eyes. It was Lisbell who, feeling betrayed by his gaze, began trembling uncontrollably, withdrawing her hands.

 

Her hands frantically pulled up her negligee, revealing a belly that had grown too large to hide.

 

Even a glance was enough to see the weight she carried. Her fingernails scraped at the stretched skin, and patches of red appeared. It was hard to tell if the blood came from her earlier wounds or new scratches, but it was a disturbing sight.

 

Ulrich let out a soft sigh and raised his hand, signaling to Victor, who handed him a prepared syringe.

 

“I.”

 

Ulrich firmly grabbed Lisbell’s wrist, stopping her from clawing at her stomach. Her five fingers twitched compulsively, as if she wanted to cut out the growing presence within her womb.

 

“I promised I would take care of it.”

 

“Huh, huh… Let go… let go…”

 

Lisbell’s disheveled hair brushed against Ulrich’s chin. He held her close, positioning her arm. There was no need to search hard—numerous needle marks from previous injections made the spot obvious.

 

“So don’t hurt yourself like this.”

 

“It won’t… it won’t stop….”

 

“You need more rest.”

 

The needle slid into the familiar spot, releasing the liquid into her veins.

 

Ulrich handed the empty syringe back to Victor.

 

Lisbell, who had been thrashing in his arms as if fighting an invisible enemy, gradually relaxed. Her head finally drooped, and Ulrich carried her to the bed, accustomed to this routine.

 The body, emaciated overall, with a belly swollen out of proportion, was carefully laid on the bed.

 

There were many things cluttering the foot of the bed. He could see dishes sprawled along with the bedside table. There were traces of vomit here and there. It seemed she had suddenly started another violent episode during a meal. Before he even signaled, Victor called the servant to clean the mess.

 

While that was being handled, Ulrich pulled the pillow from one corner and placed it under Lisbell’s head, then tugged the blanket from where it lay crumpled. After tucking it around her up to her chest, with her arms placed out of the way, Ulrich stood up from the bed.

 

“I’ll go.”

 

“It’s alright.”

 

Victor spoke, sensing where Ulrich was heading, but Ulrich brushed it off lightly and walked toward the bathroom himself. Rolling up his wrinkled sleeves, he took out a towel, soaked it in warm water, and returned to the bed. Sitting back in the same place, he lifted Lisbell’s arm, laid neatly on top of the blanket, and carefully wiped the blood-stained fingers.

 

Victor watched the scene with a subtle gaze.

 

Lisbell’s thin arm looked like it could snap with the slightest force, especially in Ulrich’s large grip. It was a frightening picture, but watching it, one quickly realized how absurd that fear was.

 

There was no hint of threat in Ulrich’s actions as he cleaned the grime off her filthy hands, moving honestly, as if to rid her of these sordid marks. He continued from her right hand to her left. While he calmly cleaned her hands, the servants finished tidying up the room and exited.

 

“The nails aren’t broken.”

 

Ulrich muttered low as he thoroughly examined Lisbell’s cleaned hands, turning them this way and that.

 

Setting aside the bloodstained towel, he walked toward the study connected to the guest room, fetched some basic medication, and returned.

 

Pulling the blanket back, he naturally lifted her nightgown. Victor, instinctively turning his head away, internally chastised himself for his awkwardness and slowly returned his gaze. This wasn’t a new sight, after all.

 

As Lisbell, sedated with a tranquilizer, continued her labored breaths, her small, swollen belly rose and fell like a little mound. The sight of that undeniable proof of life pushed an observer’s emotions into a profound place.

 

Or perhaps it was the countless scars carved into that belly.

 

Ulrich rolled up the nightgown, carefully ensuring nothing inappropriate was exposed, and squeezed ointment onto his fingers. Then he applied it meticulously to each scratch, where her fingernails had ripped her tender skin.

 

The swollen belly was, in every sense, a mess.

 

Fresh wounds weren’t even the worst of it; some had become infected after being repeatedly scratched before healing. Even scars from past torments were vividly etched, refusing to fade. Despite being so brutalized, it hadn’t yet collapsed into ruins.

 

“Shall I call a doctor?”

 

“No need.”

 



 

“Even if you do, they can’t do anything.”

 

After finishing applying the ointment, Ulrich slowly scanned Lisbell’s body. He waited for the medication to absorb before pulling down her nightgown and laying his hand on her belly through the fabric. The feeling of something densely packed inside pressed against his palm, heavy and sluggish. He could feel the faint thud of a pulse, as if it were asking to be recognized.

 

“It’s too late, my lord. The time for inducing a miscarriage has passed.”

 

“Are you saying it’s impossible now?”

 

“Even if it had been attempted within the appropriate time, it’s a risky procedure. Now, with the pregnancy this advanced…”

 



 

“Any attempt could put the young lady’s life in danger.”

 

They had called a doctor as soon as they moved to the hotel, but his opinion had been pessimistic.

 

“No matter how much you wish to avoid childbirth, I cannot recommend such a dangerous operation as a doctor. The risks far exceed what can be avoided. Now that the fetus has grown this much, it would be better for the young lady’s health to carry the pregnancy to term and give birth.”

 

The doctor’s advice was clear: the safest course to avoid putting Lisbell in immediate danger was to calm her and ensure a safe delivery.

 

But Lisbell was desperate to rid herself of the child, even if it meant offering her life in return. Her chilling panic, like today’s episode, suggested as much.

 

“I’ll make sure the tranquilizers are as mild as possible. The more uncontrollable her episodes become, the more harm it does to her body. If she becomes unmanageable, sedate her. It’s for her own good.”

 

The first time Lisbell had thrown herself onto the floor, sobbing uncontrollably, the doctor had been summoned. After examining her collapsed from exhaustion, he had sternly advised them.

 

Since then, Ulrich had personally administered tranquilizers whenever Lisbell showed signs of panic.

 

“Prepare a few more tranquilizers and send them over.”

 

“Yes, understood.”

 

“Also, what about the hospital?”

 

Though he hadn’t specified, Victor immediately understood who Ulrich was referring to. The bitter taste in his mouth made him roll his tongue as he sighed.

 

“She remains unconscious.”

 

“The doctor isn’t lying, is he?”

 

Ulrich let out a small chuckle as he pulled the blanket up to Lisbell’s neck. Victor, unsure whether to laugh or cry at the joke, stiffened his expression.

 

It was a reference to Madame Altahart, who had collapsed, bleeding profusely, when Ulrich had tried to secretly move Lisbell to the villa after he had recovered from his gunshot wound and secret rehabilitation.

 

Though everyone believed she had died, she hadn’t completely passed away. While Ulrich took Lisbell to the hotel, Madame Altahart had been rushed to the hospital and underwent surgery.

 

The situation had reversed completely.

 

Now it was Madame Altahart, in critical condition, who was bedridden.

 

Ulrich folded his arms and reflected on the past.

 

It had been an especially memorable day with the pervasive scent of blood. The first thing he encountered in the bedroom, after entering to retrieve Lisbell, was his mother’s motionless body. The scene around her was, as always, intense. But instead of jewels or elegant garments, it was a dark, destructive pool of blood.

 

“I thought she died instantly.”

 

Ignoring the blood soaking his shoes, he had gone straight to Lisbell at the table. There was no point in panicking over a lifeless body; the dead wouldn’t come back.

 

“Both I and my mother… the Altaharts seem to have surprisingly long lives.”

 

“…The doctor said that while she remains unconscious, there are signs of blood pooling in her head. A second surgery might be necessary soon.”

 

“Should I allow it?”

 

“Pardon?”

 

“The surgery—should I allow it?”

 



 

“What do you think, Victor?”

 

Victor absentmindedly watched as Ulrich gently adjusted Lisbell’s blanket. Should he allow it? Of course… it was the only way. Without it, Madame Altahart might never regain consciousness.

 

Not only that. If the situation worsened beyond what could be managed…

 

“But… sir.”

 

Victor’s hesitant objection vanished as soon as Ulrich’s gaze met his. He realized immediately. This wasn’t a question.

 

“No one disputes that Mother was wise and intelligent. But I’ve often thought her greed went too far. Greed can sometimes lead to disaster.”

 



 

“This might be one of those times.”

 

Victor read the fierce current in Ulrich’s expression, like a flame burning quietly but intensely. His anger, compacted and buried deep, leaked out bit by bit, like a pressure too strong to contain.

 

Ulrich lowered his eyes. He recalled coaxing Lisbell out from under the table that day, soothing her and cradling her in his arms.

 

“Perhaps it’s best to end things now before I have to get involved.”

 



 

“Because of Lisbell’s mistake, this accident was inevitable…”

 

The feeling of disillusionment struck him as he faced the degradation of something he had carefully nurtured all along.

 

It was enough to unsettle him. That discomfort was one reason he hadn’t bothered checking on his mother before leaving the bedroom.

“I think you understand me.”

 

Victor bit his lips. It was a phrase that carried multiple layers of meaning. He stared at his superior with sunken, dark eyes before bowing his head slightly.

 

“I’ll report to you as soon as we hear from the hospital.”

 

In other words, he was urging Ulrich to take his time and think calmly before making any decisions. However, Victor’s attempt to intervene felt pitifully weak.

 

He couldn’t forget the horrible things that the lady had done to Lisbell while Ulrich was unconscious. Therefore, Victor had made up his mind to betray the lady and side with Ulrich. Given all these factors, the path he had to follow was clear, even if it wasn’t to his liking…

 

“And…”

 

Victor’s gaze moved toward the bed.

 

Ulrich was lightly patting his hand resting on his abdomen, as if he hoped she was simply sleeping peacefully. From one angle, it looked like he was stroking the child growing inside her. But to Victor, who knew the details of the past few days better than anyone, it didn’t seem like a harmonious scene at all.

 

“And?”

 

Ulrich, noticing Victor’s hesitation, turned to his secretary. Victor flinched slightly, his lips moving soundlessly before he brushed it off as nothing.

 

It wasn’t something he could ask.

 

“Are you serious?”

 

Are you seriously considering granting Lisbell Osborne’s request?

 

Are you really going to go through with her demand to get rid of the baby?

 

This doubt had arisen because of Ulrich’s recent attitude.

 

“I told you I would take care of it.”

 

Every time Lisbell became unstable, like today, Ulrich would leave such a responsible assurance. Not only that, but he had consulted with doctors several times about a miscarriage, far more than anyone could count. His approach to the matter was serious, not the kind of plot one would expect if he were planning to further devastate her.

 

But then again, there hadn’t been any proactive steps toward fulfilling her request, making it hard to believe that he truly intended to go through with it. It was as if he were gathering information from a distance, observing the situation without taking a clear stance. His actions were ambiguous at best.

 

Victor couldn’t ask because, no matter the answer, he would be in a difficult position.

 

Even though he had betrayed the lady, she was still part of the Altahart household. He hadn’t forgotten how significant the issue of the family’s heir was. Given his position, he couldn’t willingly support the idea of eliminating the potential future of the family.

 

On the other hand, he wasn’t comfortable with the idea of the child being born either.

 

After all, the person carrying the child wanted so desperately for it not to be born.

 

Lisbell was no longer the person she once was. Although she had a gloomy air about her in the past, she had at least seemed capable of holding herself together. Now, however, that was no longer the case… Wanting her to give birth in this situation felt no different from the way the lady had treated her like a mere animal.

 

In short, Victor’s sense of duty as a secretary was constantly clashing with his moral values as a human being.

 

That’s why he was so focused on Ulrich’s attitude. No matter how much Victor agonized over it, the words that came out of Ulrich’s mouth would ultimately be the right answer. His decision would become Victor’s decision, and that decision would shape Lisbell Osborne’s future.

 

Honestly, that was a relief. The more Victor thought about it, the more he realized this was beyond him. He wished his superior would make the call so he could simply follow, shutting his eyes and ears to everything else.

 

But with Ulrich’s vague behavior, it was driving Victor crazy.

 

It wasn’t the first time Ulrich had acted like this, but in the past, Victor could always figure out the answer by observing the situation and Ulrich’s demeanor. However, this time, his superior’s intentions were completely unreadable.

 

And time continued to pass…

 

“I’ll do my best to arrange the afternoon schedule to avoid any issues.”

 

“Sort out what can be handled via phone or written correspondence first.”

 

“Yes, understood.”

 

When Ulrich left his work for the day, he wouldn’t leave the guest room. Expecting the same today, Victor concluded the matter and took a quick glance at Lisbell’s belly before exiting the room.

 



 

Her mind was foggy. That was the first impression she had when she woke up.

 

A thick mist was spreading from the horizon, swallowing her ankles and calves, eating away at half of her body before seeping into every crevice and occupying her brain.

 

“Are you awake?”

 

A muffled voice, as though coming from underwater, landed on her cheek. Lisbell blinked her eyes, struggling to open them, and looked up with difficulty.

 

The man who had left the room that morning had returned without her realizing. His presence, along with the symptoms her body was exhibiting, revealed that the side effects of the sedatives were still at play.

 

Out of habit, Lisbell lowered her hand and touched her belly. Even the brief sense of hope she had felt had faded. The repulsive swelling remained. It stubbornly protruded, mocking the times when her body had been smooth and flat.

 

A slow sigh of disappointment escaped her.

 

If she could, she would have hit her stomach again. Whether with a bottle in hand, the frame hanging on the wall, or, if nothing else, her bare fists.

 

But she couldn’t even clench her fists properly. One of the side effects of the sedative. Her body was drained of strength, and nothing would work unless it was an unconscious act.

 

Why did it feel so unfair and heartbreaking? Maybe because of her unstable state, her emotions surged violently. Instead of gradually rising, they hit all at once like a tidal wave, only to vanish as if they had never been there. Then she would be left feeling like a lonely outsider, unable to adjust.

 

Lisbell finally understood what that felt like.

 

It was the feeling of collapsing, piece by piece.

 

Or, perhaps, it was like going mad.

 

It was evidence that anyone could see—she was no longer normal.

 

Even though she knew the storm would pass and things would calm down soon, she couldn’t shake off her current state of mind. Her emotions were impulsive and intense. The fact that her body wasn’t responding as she wished only made her more furious.

 

She wished her body would just break apart on its own.

 

Even if she wasn’t doing anything in particular, if only there was a way to destroy this body.

 

Lisbell became aware of the man’s hand stroking her long hair, which now reached her chest. She suddenly recalled all the harm this hand had done to her. The things that hurt her the most. The things that tormented her. The things that caused her suffering without her even having to move…

 

Lisbell, who had been staring straight ahead, stiffly lifted her head. Although she was lying lazily on the bed, she saw him sitting with documents in hand.

 

Their eyes met. His sea-colored eyes rippled slightly as he smiled, crinkling the corners of his eyes.

 

“What is it?”

 



 

“Are you hungry? Should I bring you something to eat?”

 

“Do it.”

 

“What?”

 

“Do it with me.”

 

“…Excuse me?”

 

Lisbell slowly lifted herself up, gathering what little strength she had. It was only then that she realized she had been resting her head on his lap. She had seen this scene so many times after waking up that it no longer fazed her.

 

“Hug me.”

 



 

“Hug me.”

 

Her hand, which had been gripping the sheet, slowly moved. It climbed up to his knee, where she had been resting her head a moment ago. Her delicate fingers crawled up to his firm thigh, fragile as if they might snap at any moment.

 

“Hmm?”

 

Ulrich raised an eyebrow, looking slightly puzzled, as if wondering why she was saying such things after just waking up. Meanwhile, Lisbell gradually straddled his leg. Ulrich’s upper body leaned back against the headboard. Her hand, which had been feeling around his thigh, touched the center of his pants.

 

The sound of her fingers tapping the buckle was less of a sensual signal and more of a desperate plea.

 

“We have to…”

 



 

“We have to do it now… right now.”

 

Ulrich, who had been staring intently at Lisbell as she spoke, let out a soft groan as if he had finally understood why she was acting this way. That groan soon turned into a sigh, followed by a short, throaty chuckle.

 

“This is the worst seduction I’ve ever encountered in my life…”

 

While Ulrich went through several stages of reaction, Lisbell dutifully undid the buckle of his pants. She pulled his clothes down to some extent, but the sheer size of his frame made it seem impossible. To make matters worse, his form was starting to grow the moment she touched him.

 

Throwing the documents onto the bedside table, Ulrich rubbed his face and chuckled, as if in disbelief.

 

“The fact that I’m even going along with this is ridiculous.”

 

Before long, his hand slipped beneath her negligee, lifting it up.


A hand naturally slipped down and caressed her lower back. The touch was sticky, as if proudly flaunting whose body it was touching. It was distinctly different from Lisbell’s desperate movements to survive.

 

Unlike her swollen, protruding front, he stroked her thinner lower back and then raised his arms. His hands felt her prominent shoulder blades. Having done this so often, he could discern the shape without looking. Perhaps they were even sharper than he remembered. Given her current condition, it was likely.

 

Every time he moved, wrinkles formed over the negligee, and the outline of her body became visible through the fabric. It was clear where Ulrich’s hand was placed and how it was moving. Soon, his hand shifted towards her chest.

 

“Huh…”

 

When he grabbed her left breast, Lisbell’s eyes flinched slightly. Her tightly pressed lips cracked open, letting out a sound that could only be described as unbearably cute.

 

Ulrich slowly wet his lips with his tongue, never taking his eyes off her face. Despite his intense concentration, his hand never stopped moving.

 

Like usual, he spread his fingers, trying to gather her small breasts. However, before he could grab them roughly, the soft flesh willingly filled his palm. Noticing how it yielded under his touch, he smirked slightly.

 

“Definitely.”

 

“Uh… huh…”

 

“It seems they’ve gotten a bit bigger.”

 

At his quiet, admiring murmur, Lisbell felt as if her mind was being crushed. An inexplicable chill surged from deep within her.

 

She took a long breath, as if experiencing hyperventilation, then firmly grabbed the flesh she had been avoiding. At that moment, as Ulrich scratched her nipple with his fingernail, he let out a feigned sound of pain.

 

“If you grab like that, even the firmness will disappear.”

 



 

“If you want to receive what’s mine, you need to be gentler.”

 

His cajoling words uncomfortably tickled her ears. Lisbell acted as if accepting his cock into her body was her sole purpose. Her lips, which had been making delicate moans, straightened into a line, and she clumsily began stroking his long dick.

 

Ever since his pants had come loose, his half-erect cock swelled quickly under her touch. The veins, prominent and beautifully raised, throbbed gently along with her hand’s movements.

 

“…Ugh…”

 

Suddenly, her negligee was lifted, exposing her completely. Ulrich took one of her breasts, which he had been groping under her clothes, into his mouth. Her round areola pressed against his moist inner cheeks, making a soft sucking sound.

 

The humid breath and his tongue directly stimulated her prominent coral-pink nipple. The sensation felt like invisible fine hairs standing on end.

 

“Harder… mm…”

 

While sucking on her nipple, Ulrich muttered in a slightly slurred voice.

 

Lisbell tried rubbing his cock with more strength than before, but it still seemed unsatisfactory. Ulrich overlapped his hand with hers, guiding the pace. His cock, which hadn’t entered her in a long time, was throbbing with excitement, leaking pre-cum drop by drop.

 

“Ha, ah.”

 

Lisbell gasped, swallowing hard. As Ulrich sucked fiercely on her nipple, he used his free hand to spread her buttocks. Although he didn’t seem to have any intention of touching her entrance, his fingers lingered ambiguously near her perineum, a sensitive area he usually wouldn’t touch, making her skin tingle.

 



 

As Lisbell turned her head, biting her lower lip, her eyes caught the large mirror covering one side of the room. The mirror was so expansive that it clearly reflected the way she and Ulrich were entwined on the bed.

 

Lisbell thought her appearance, rubbing herself against him like this, looked grotesque.

 

Her arms and legs were pitifully thin compared to his, and yet her belly was swollen, pressing down on Ulrich’s firmly erect manhood. Despite not being overly large for a pregnant woman, her small frame made her belly seem disproportionately big. To Lisbell, it all looked disturbingly strange.

 

Only after a moment did she realize that it had been a long time since she last looked at herself in a mirror. The realization of how much her appearance had deteriorated, so clear in the mirror, hit her hard.

 

Not only did she find herself strange, but the man clinging to her, sucking on her breasts and groping her buttocks, pulling her toward him like a child nursing, was equally puzzling. She genuinely wondered if he didn’t find her revolting. Objectively, she looked too worn out to exhibit any beauty or sensuality. She felt like a stiff, weathered piece of driftwood, barely making it ashore after being tossed around in the vast ocean.

 

Everything was disgusting.

 

Herself and the man who was aroused by her.

 

Ulrich’s eyes narrowed slightly as he twirled her nipple with his tongue. Lisbell had suddenly grabbed his shoulder, bending her knees to sit up. By changing her position, she had pulled away from the nipple he had been delicately caressing with his tongue. He looked displeased.

 

For a moment, though, the tip of his cock, which had been bobbing freely, slid into the soft gap between her thighs, nudging its way toward her entrance under her hand’s guidance.

 

“Huh, mm…”

 

The head of his cock bumped against her entrance as if obediently following her hand’s lead.

 

Lisbell slowly lowered herself onto him.

 

“Uh, ha… agh…”

 

The sensation of her flesh stretching as it was pushed open sent chills through her body. Ulrich realized that she intended to skip the foreplay and jump straight to the main act. But there was no stopping her. He merely gazed at her with a look that seemed to dissect her, bringing his hand to his mouth to moisten his fingers with saliva.

 

“If you think you can just shove it in like that…”

 

“Ugh… ahh…”

 

“You should know by now…”

 

“Huh, huhuhk…”

 

“Are you so desperate to tear yourself open?”

 

As he said, she could barely breathe. It felt inexplicably larger than before. In the past, she thought it would go in smoothly enough, but now, the girth of his cock struggled to even halfway penetrate her opening.

 

Seeing her struggling, Ulrich slipped his saliva-coated fingers between her buttocks. As he gently rubbed her tightly clenched entrance, Lisbell’s body flinched violently.

 

“Relax. Let me… put it in.”

 

Even though only the head of his cock was inside, the pressure was intense enough to drive him crazy. Fighting the heat building up in his lower body, Ulrich slowly massaged her delicate entrance. When he felt her tense flesh relax slightly, he carefully pried the entrance open with his finger, allowing the rigid cock to push in a little deeper.

 

Her tense, tightly clenching entrance gradually loosened, allowing his cock to slide in more smoothly. The veins along the cock pressed against her sensitive spots, causing Lisbell’s back to arch involuntarily.

 

“Huh…!”

 

“There you go. What was the rush?”

 

Once fully inside, Ulrich’s breathing became slightly ragged as he felt the walls of her insides squeeze him tightly.

 

Ulrich, now leaning back against the head of the bed, used his fingers to spread her further, letting his thick cock push deeper inside her. Both of them felt it as he buried himself to the hilt.

 

“Aah…!”

 

“Were we always… haah, stuck here? It feels like it should go deeper…”

 

The overwhelming pressure and a strange sense of vulnerability made Ulrich mutter under his breath as his gaze dropped to her swollen belly. It seemed to him that the tightness inside her was somehow connected to that.

 Lisbell couldn’t even properly track where his gaze was heading. Without even getting a chance to steal a proper glance at his face, she turned her waist impulsively. She wanted to thrust as hard as she could. She wished that, as the end of this organ that shouldn’t be touched reached the point where it flickered before her eyes, it would relentlessly scratch at the fragile interior.

 

She wanted to be left with irreparable internal damage.

 

She wanted it to be just painful enough.

 

There was no room for doubt. There had never been a time during intercourse with Ulrich when it wasn’t like this. It always felt like she was being broken, and she couldn’t shake the feeling of being damaged in some unknown way.

 

Even when she experienced sexual pleasure so intense that her peripheral nerves stood on end, the act always carried a sense of incompleteness.

 

“Mm, ugh…! Ha, ha…”

 

Lisbell had no patience to wait for it to come on its own. She began the rough act without hesitation. She wanted it to make a wet, slapping sound, but her body was too heavy, limiting her.

 

All she could do was push with her knees and move her entire body up and down. Even one movement felt like she was struggling to push through water, barely overcoming surface tension.

 

Lisbell soon began to experience tiny spasms in her breath, and instead of taking more of him, she rubbed herself against the inside, brushing her walls. Ulrich, watching her with disbelief in his eyes, suddenly grabbed her waist and pulled her sharply toward him.

 

“Ah…!”

 

For a moment, the round curve of his glans pushed against her tender flesh, driving deep toward the place she desired. Her hips, holding his large organ, trembled. Moments later, Lisbell’s hand reached up to his abs, groping towards his chest.

 

“More, more…”

 

Just once.

 

She felt like crying at Ulrich’s cruelty for stopping after just a single thrust that she so desperately wanted.

 

This wasn’t enough. She needed him to thrust deeper, more painfully. He had to be harsher, more ruthless with her. With this tenacious being, whom she couldn’t separate from on her own, only such brutality could be effective.

 

“More… harder…”

 



 

“Hurry… hurry, do it. Do it like just now… like just now.”

 

Ulrich, who had been watching her intently, suddenly sat up and pressed his lips against hers. All the breaths she had been barely releasing were drawn into him. As a result, her chest felt hollow. It was a cold sensation, so much so that she couldn’t even tell what she was breathing with.

 

As Lisbell curled her fingers, the posture she had been holding collapsed. Her body tilted back. Ulrich, who had laid her on the bed, climbed on top of her and adjusted her awkwardly folded legs.

 

“Even your impatience is cute.”

 

Ulrich, who had settled between her wide-open thighs, began to unbutton his shirt one by one.

 

“It’s been a while. Let’s enjoy this, together.”

 

A scar that looked quite rugged appeared as the front of his shirt gradually opened. It was a blemish left on his otherwise unmarred body, the result of a bullet that had torn through his flesh and muscle, requiring extensive stitches.

 

That scar, just below his heart and in a conspicuous spot, was something Lisbell had personally left on him. Seeing that it no longer seemed to hinder his movement, the scar had healed over without leaving any chance for it to disappear completely.

 

“Hah… ah, ouch…!”

 

Ulrich, tossing his shirt aside, grabbed Lisbell’s ankle and moved his hips smoothly. His organ, fully occupying her entrance, pushed deep to its root before pulling out again.

 

The act, which had initially only stimulated her in a gentle rubbing motion, now thrust deeply, bringing a new heat to her abdomen. As they matched their rhythm, an unmistakable wet sound echoed from below.

 

“Hah… ah, ah…!”

 

“Ha… lift your negligee.”

 

Lisbell obediently followed his command. She thought it would excite him more.

 

It still wasn’t enough. She needed to release Ulrich’s restraint even further.

 

As her body shook from the thrusts, her negligee, which had slipped down to cover half her belly, was pulled up to expose her breasts.

 

Ulrich’s gaze, momentarily softened by the pleasure building within him, fell on her exposed breasts. Even as he maintained his rhythmic thrusts, pushing and pulling through the tight passage, his eyes fixed on her gradually reddening nipples.

 

“Why don’t you touch your own chest? Focus on the nipples. It’ll feel even better.”

 

Lisbell moved her hands, which had been holding onto the lace of her negligee, to her breasts. She gathered the small mounds in her hands to create volume, gently rubbing her nipples with her fingertips.

 

Each time she did, Ulrich let out a low, raspy groan, filled with an uncontainable sensuality.

 

“Rub them harder, like I do. Enough to make the nipple roll inward.”

 

His instructions were precise. Even amidst all this, Lisbell remained acutely aware of the sensation of his length splitting her walls apart as she brought two fingers to her nipples.

 

She rubbed them gently, rotating her fingers before pressing down hard enough that the nipples nearly disappeared into her areolas. Watching her, Ulrich let out a dissatisfied breath.

 

“Hmph… I want to kiss you.”

 

Lisbell realized why he was hesitating. The problem was the large, round belly between them. If he pressed down on her and kissed her hungrily, her belly would inevitably be squeezed by his weight.

 

As soon as she understood, Lisbell reached out with both arms.

 

She pulled him down by his shoulders, and when he was close enough, she wrapped her arms around his neck, preventing him from pulling away. She brought his lips to hers.

 

Ulrich, following her lead, propped himself up on his arms and entwined his tongue passionately with hers. Before their lips met, his faint smile might have drawn a soft curve, but Lisbell wasn’t sure since she hadn’t seen it with her eyes.

 

“Mmph… mm…”

 

His soft tongue coiled around hers, his even teeth nibbling at her. He licked every corner of her mouth, from the palate to the sensitive inside of her cheeks, where his cock had made her flinch with every thrust. Finally, he pulled away, leaving behind a silver thread between them as proof of their passionate kiss.

 

Ulrich adjusted her legs, folding her knees, and thrust into her with a sharp angle. Her body, already slick from the messy act, welcomed his penetration with no resistance. Every time his substantial girth hit her insides, her lower body grew hot and damp.

 

“You seem to be enjoying this. You’re clenching much more softly than before… hmm.”

 

“Hah… ah, ah…!”

 

Their thighs brushed against each other endlessly as her open legs continued to rub against his pelvis. Each time their hips met, the wet sound of their bodies colliding echoed between them.

 

He occasionally wiped the fluids running down her inner thighs with his fingers and brought them to his lips, licking them clean. The ferocious hunger in his actions made it seem like he wanted to bury his head between her legs and devour her, but this was the only way he could satiate that thirst.

 

“Hah, hah, hah…!”

 

Her lower body was being relentlessly pounded. The force of his thrusts grew stronger and stronger. The intensity of the friction as he burrowed into her sent tingles all the way through her abdomen.

 

“Ah, ah!”

 

The climax was fast approaching, like an enormous wave rushing toward her. She knew she wouldn’t be able to escape it, and the anticipation twisted her nerves with tension. No matter how many times she experienced it, the overwhelming sensation was always new, biting into her entire body.

 

His thrusts quickened, mercilessly pounding into her.

 

The soft flesh inside her couldn’t keep up with the speed, clinging tightly to his dick before being pulled away, only to return to its place as he thrust back in. Their intertwined bodies were a vivid testament to the intensity of their coupling, with the pleasure seeping deeply into her waist.

 

His fingers, wet with her fluids, parted her folds and rubbed her swollen clitoris, stoking the pleasure that had already surged through her body.

 

Her walls tightened around him, squeezing his length with a desperate hunger. Feeling the direct feedback from the stimulation, Ulrich let out a ragged breath, thrusting deeply into her.

 

“Hah…!”

 

Lisbell’s jaw snapped upward as her trembling thighs spasmed. Her swollen belly shifted along with her body’s convulsions.

 

The once-narrow passage contracted tightly around him, clenching as though trying to trap him inside. The intense climax gripped her body, leaving her staring blankly at the ceiling as she came down from the peak.

 

“…Not yet…”

 Ulrich, who had stopped his movements with a small frown because her insides were too narrow, slowly raised his head.

 

“No, this is… this is… not….”

 

Lisbell muttered absentmindedly.

 

It didn’t hurt as much as she had thought. What was certain was that the pleasure was more powerful than the pain. That shouldn’t have happened. She shouldn’t be asking him to hug her, asking for something like this, humiliatingly so.

 

“This isn’t it. This, this isn’t it….”

 

What Lisbell wanted was pain. More pain than now. Living pain. That was why she couldn’t be satisfied with such a lukewarm level. Whether it was kindness or consideration, she hadn’t been hoping for such humiliation that was so different from normal sex.

 

“More, more.”

 

Lisbell, staring into space with unfocused eyes, waved her hands. At the end, when his shoulder was caught, she lowered herself and grabbed his forearm. She muttered with a face that couldn’t find her lost soul as she brought it up to her neck.

 

“This time, hard… make it hurt, make it hurt more. Squeeze my neck, my neck. Whether it’s with a tie, a hand, anything…. You were always like that. You’re not like this, you’re not this affectionate…!”

 

Her eyes, which were slit open, were getting wet little by little. Ulrich just quietly watched Lisbell’s actions as she pulled his hand and wrapped it around the nape of his neck.

 

It was too suffocating. She couldn’t stand it, and her insides felt twisted. So in the end, she used both hands and created a picture of him grabbing her neck.

 

“Hold it like this, hold it like this, squeeze it, make it so I can’t breathe….”

 

She tried to get him to squeeze her neck with the tie and with his hands. Every time, a dizzying sense of closure came over her, as if she was trapped in a small box without a single hole. She thought that she had to feel so much pain by suffocating, and only then would she be able to completely extinguish the being that was making her life miserable…

 

Ulrich, who had not responded the whole time, moved his fingers quietly. He groped a certain section of her skin. Lisbell vaguely realized that it was the part that had become scarred from the burn.

 

Just like the scars carved into Ulrich’s body, the same scars carved into her body.

 

The moments when they had tried to kill each other overlapped and came to mind. Lisbell blinked her eyelids at a speed slower than her breathing. The water droplets hanging from her moistened eyelashes flowed down her cheeks.

 

Ulrich’s hand, which had been caressing the long scar that seemed to have been cut on her neck, stopped when he found it. Soon, he came up and covered Lisbell’s cheeks, wiping away the tear stains. He licked the stain on his index finger with his tongue and let out a languid laugh.

 

“If you want.”

 

The body that had been lying in a proper posture turned to the side. He lay behind her, his chest pressed against her back, and pushed his penis, which had slipped out slightly while adjusting his position, all the way to the root. Unlike Lisbell who had reached her climax, the flesh that was still stiff because she had not yet reached ejaculation entered the hole that had become sloppy as it drank water.

 

“Ugh….”

 

Ulrich lifted one of her closed legs and held it in place, then pounded her buttocks. As the position changed, the area where the glans was pressing down slightly shifted. He dug in a little deeper than before, but perhaps because the speed had slowed down, a strange sensation continued to stimulate the nerves. The feeling of her insides being twisted and her toes curled inward.

 

“No, no…. More, ugh, harder… Ah…!”

 

“Harder?”

 

“Ugh, yes…!”

 

“Like this?”

 

He grabbed Lisbell’s pelvis and pressed his lower body against hers. He followed along as if he would listen to anything she said, but the speed of his thrusts was the same, and the force of his thrusts didn’t get stronger.

 

No, rather, it seemed to be slower, more gentle… thrusting. Not to cause damage, but as if he was going to make her melt completely.

 

The more she begged out loud, the more gentle it felt.

 

Ulrich leisurely and steadily drove the stakes as if he was risking his life to make her feel it. The hot sensation spread from the parts that were constantly touching without a moment to stop. The inside of his stomach contracted violently as if it was being squeezed, then released. Every time that happened, he could feel the flesh that smoothly wrapped around his p*nis getting wet.

 

A shiver so thick it made her eyelids shoot open and flowed down her spine. Her feet awkwardly stretched out.

 

This wasn’t it. What she wanted wasn’t something that would burst so slowly.

 

Something violent and destructive, like being hit in a vital spot, so easily surpassing her threshold of control…

Lisbell put her hand on his forearm that was holding her leg. Since words didn’t work, she had no choice but to urge him with actions. Her nails dug sharply into her torn forearm. The white skin was scraped and scratched, and a drop of blood formed in the spot where it had swelled slightly.

 

Despite such desperate signals, he never turned his waist teasing into something sadistic. Perhaps because the position of lying next to each other was uncomfortable, he later sat up and rubbed her lower body with one of her legs over his shoulder, but there was no difference in the way he shoveled.

 

That day, the man did not give Lisbell the sex she wanted until the end.

 



What is depression?

At times, it resembled a desolate green swamp. Other times, it was like a horizon with no end in sight. And at other times, it felt like a sudden shower falling from a clear sky.

In other words, it was an overwhelming surge of the senses.

Lisbell couldn’t clearly define this hollow phenomenon that persistently tried to consume her, but she vaguely understood where it all began.

It started from a very small doubt.

A doubt no bigger than the tip of a fingernail.



The light filling the room was blindingly bright. It was a peaceful morning that had returned in the blink of an eye.

She didn’t know whether it was due to withdrawal from the sedatives she took regularly or something else entirely, but her sleep duration had significantly increased lately. So she assumed the man had already left and she was alone in the room again—but that thought was erased instantly by the warm breath brushing her shoulder.

The one lying behind her slowly rose up. A shadow fell heavily across Lisbell’s face as she lay on her side. Confirming that she was awake, Ulrich gave a gentle smile and brushed his lips against her temple.

As always, he had woken up before her. From afar, the sound of running water suggested he had just gone to wash. It sounded like rain outside. That simple, trivial sound stirred up quite a few memories. For instance, dreams of her mother’s organs being torn out by the beaks of crows…

She hadn’t thought summer was completely over yet. But maybe it was. Suddenly, it felt like the temperature around her had dropped. A chill sharp enough to bite into her bones crept in, and Lisbell curled her feet inward under the blanket.

With that movement, the sound of running water that had been ringing in her ears abruptly vanished. In its place, the distinct clink of a chain extending entered like an auditory hallucination. A strange coldness clung to the area near her ankle, sharp and protruding like a bone.

Lisbell slid her hand under the blanket. She groped around her ankle but felt nothing. So why did she keep hearing it? This sound. Did others hear it too? This sound…

Puzzled, she shook her ankle from side to side.

It rang again.

She stopped shaking.

Still, it rang.

Strange.

She repeated the motion several times, reflecting again and again on her abnormal state, then suddenly gave up as if bored with everything. In the past, she might’ve slapped her own ear out of frustration, but now she was too exhausted—too drained from the lingering sedative—to even muster the strength.

Before long, Ulrich returned. Lisbell stared vacantly at him, loosely wrapped in a robe.

Doubt had a breath of its own. Once it settled deep within, its pulsing rhythm could no longer be stilled. And now, inside Lisbell, that same beat echoed.

To suspect something was always a terrifying thing.

In the past, Lisbell had feared that warped rhythm. And truthfully, she still did, to some degree. Doubt, the seed of depression, had a way of violently blooming, gripping and wringing one’s consciousness.

There was only one difference now:

Lisbell was no longer foolish enough to outwardly reveal such unstable emotions.

Without taking her eyes off him, she spoke suddenly.

“I want to go out.”

Ulrich, who had been opening the mail Victor had delivered early that morning, turned to look at her.

Without a word, he met her gaze, then deliberately placed the mail aside and circled around to the bed. Lisbell had wondered why he took such a roundabout route—only to realize he did so just to embrace her from behind, peppering small kisses on the nape of her neck, worn and frayed with old scars.

A droplet of water fell from his still-damp platinum hair and slid down Lisbell’s cheek. Ulrich gently wiped it away with his finger, as if brushing off a trail of tears, and asked softly:

“Where to?”

“Anywhere…”

Her voice was like a grain of sand—something so small it could easily slip through one’s fingers and vanish if not held carefully.

Ulrich laid down beside her, propping his chin on his hand, idly playing with her gray hair. It had grown longer since she was brought back to the mansion, but still not to his liking. Twisting the naturally curling ends around his finger, he murmured a suggestion:

“Then how about we have our meal in the lounge on the first floor today?”

Lisbell didn’t respond right away, but eventually turned to face him. Ulrich’s smile bloomed like a flower in full bloom, pleased that she had turned to him of her own will.

His fingers gently brushed across the hollows of her eyelids.

“But only if you promise to actually eat properly when we go down.”



“Lisbell, you’ve lost too much weight. No matter how much time passes, you’re not returning to your old self because you keep barely eating.”

“…So I’m allowed to leave this room?”

Ulrich tilted his head slightly, drawing out his reply playfully.

“Hm? Didn’t you just say that’s what you wanted?”

She had, indeed.

But still…

Lisbell moved her ankle again beneath the blanket.

The sound… Could she still hear it?

Or not?

She wasn’t sure.

Ulrich leaned closer, his lips briefly brushing her cheek before pulling away. Maintaining his ever-gentle expression, he rose from the bed.

“I told you, I’ll grant you whatever you want.”



“Come now, get up and get ready. The view from the lounge is different from the one here in the room. I hired a landscape designer to make it beautiful—you’ll like it.”

Ulrich moved around the bedroom as if he had been waiting for this very day. Seeing that Lisbell, despite being the one to suggest it, had no intention of moving, he ended up escorting her to the bathroom himself, helping her bathe. He then called for Victor, instructing him to bring suitable clothes for her to wear.

“Are we going out?”

“We’ll be heading to the lounge.”

Hearing this, Victor glanced over Ulrich’s shoulder. Slouched in a plush wing chair, Lisbell was unmistakably showing signs of pregnancy now.

After a moment’s hesitation, Victor leaned in and whispered so only Ulrich could hear:

“Shall I restrict access to the lounge while you’re down there?”

“No need.”

Ulrich’s swift reply left Victor visibly flustered.

“Pardon? But…”

Even if foot traffic was light, the hotel wasn’t completely devoid of guests. Other patrons were still staying on different floors.

And the first-floor lounge, in particular, was a highlight of the hotel—a glass conservatory with a flowing artificial stream, a scenic space that had been crafted with great care. In all his time managing the space, Victor couldn’t recall a moment it had ever been empty.

Yet Ulrich was planning to take Lisbell there. The implication of choosing such a public space was clear—it was a declaration, a public acknowledgment of their relationship.

“It’s fine.”

Ulrich’s calm response seemed to directly address Victor’s concerns. Watching his composed expression, Victor gave a small, respectful nod. It dawned on him—perhaps this had been Ulrich’s intent all along when he brought up the lounge.

If that was true, then Ulrich truly intended a future with Lisbell Osborne…

“Understood. In that case… I won’t take any special precautions.”

Victor quickly wrapped up the conversation and contacted a nearby boutique to prepare clothing suitable for Lisbell. Ulrich reviewed the selection before she even saw it, picking out a few outfits to dress her himself.

But whatever she wore, it looked out of place. Though some of the clothes covered her stomach well enough, the sleeves and pants were far too long.

“It looks like you’ve snuck into an adult’s wardrobe,” Ulrich said, smiling at her with a lightheartedness that didn’t quite match the absurdity of her appearance. He gently folded the long sleeves back for her.

Lisbell stood still in front of him, expressionless.

After brushing her cheek once with the back of his hand, he took her by the hand and led her toward the door, saying it was time to go.

She didn’t know how long it had been since she last walked anywhere, but her body had clearly weakened. Even going down one flight of stairs left her breathless. For the rest, she had to rely on Ulrich’s arm around her waist, descending step by step with great effort.

The lounge wasn’t far from the lobby. But from the moment they stepped into the open, anyone who caught sight of them turned their attention their way.

At first, people approached, smiling as they recognized Ulrich. But gradually, their gazes shifted to Lisbell, standing quietly by his side like a shadow.

She had experienced something like this before. It was the same in the hallway of the theater where she once went to see a play. But back then, many things had been different—both in how others perceived her, and in the actual circumstances.

“Well, I’m with someone, so I’ll take my leave now.”

Ulrich, caught in conversation, didn’t linger. After a brief exchange of pleasantries, he politely excused himself, clearly indicating that his reason for leaving was the companion at his side—Lisbell—by pulling her closer with the arm wrapped around her waist.

And just like that, the awkward gazes directed at him shifted, as if by reflex, to Lisbell, once again scanning her.

The curious stares varied in nature.

Some were laced with nothing more than pure curiosity. Others, however, carried an air of judgment, making her feel subtly uneasy. It was especially so when their eyes landed on the obvious swell of her belly, which no clothing could completely conceal.

How did she look in their eyes?

Ulrich was still unmarried—did they think she was a mistress he doted on so excessively that he got her pregnant? The mere thought of such an assumption made Lisbell feel sick, and she forced herself to stop caring.

Perhaps because it was still early in the morning, there were only a few guests in the lounge’s dining area. Still, it wasn’t empty. As they entered, just like before, all eyes turned to them. Ulrich handled the incoming greetings with practiced ease, guiding Lisbell toward a table bathed in warm sunlight.

“He’s the president of a major newspaper—‘Osvalley,’” Ulrich said suddenly.

“…Sorry?”

“The man who was smiling while staring at your belly earlier.”

He spoke as he sat down across from her, after seating her first.

“And the mustached man who looked like a desperate dog trying to speak to you—he’s a big name in the trade industry.”



“And… who else was there…”

“Why… are you telling me this?” she asked.

Ulrich smiled, as if waiting for her to ask.

“I thought you might be curious.”

But she wasn’t. Not particularly. She had never really been interested. What puzzled her was Ulrich’s behavior.

The overwhelming attention that followed them the moment they appeared—the way he nonchalantly exposed their affair to such eyes, almost as if asking the world to acknowledge it. This absurd situation where her private life could become tabloid gossip at any moment.

All of it would ultimately backfire on Ulrich.

Of course, he had been prepared to marry her and had even made arrangements for a wedding. But there was still a stark difference between an official announcement by the Althahart family and a media leak turned sensational headline.

And yet, after causing all of this so boldly, how could he remain so unbothered?

Yes, truly… Ulrich was unshaken.

Her belly was still very much visible.

He had told her to leave everything to him—but not a single thing had been resolved. And here he was, acting without the slightest trace of urgency. Meanwhile, Lisbell was terrified by the mere thought of tomorrow. Each new day felt like swallowing fear whole, just to open her eyes again.

That’s why it bothered her.

Not knowing what he was thinking—that was fatal. Most of the time she had fallen into his traps, it was because she couldn’t see what he was already watching.

That’s also why she had stubbornly insisted on leaving the room today. While he no longer bound her by the neck or ankles, she wanted to see if he was still silently keeping her confined. But Ulrich had simply said—

“Didn’t I say I’d give you anything you wanted, Lisbell?”

As if mocking her doubts, he said it so easily. And just like that, he took her out. Into a public space, no less, where she could mix with others. It was a tactic she knew too well to miss. He always used hope and despair like carrots and sticks, precisely and cruelly.

While she was lost in thought, someone approached the table. Maybe Victor had given a heads-up—though they hadn’t even ordered, dishes were served one after another. As plates filled the table, Lisbell looked across at him.

He sat back leisurely, legs crossed, holding a coffee cup. Taking his time, savoring both the drink and the moment.

“Eat up. You promised to eat well when you agreed to come out with me.”

Ulrich gestured toward the spread of food on the table. Lisbell slowly picked up her cutlery. The food smelled and tasted excellent, but the moment she swallowed a bite, nausea hit her. Still, she forced it down. She chewed and swallowed even the steaming hot dishes without pause, as if that alone could prove something.

Her throat felt torn, and her windpipe raw, but she kept chewing like it was a matter of pride. Seeing that stubborn defiance, Ulrich smiled faintly, as though amused, and gently wiped her lips with a handkerchief.

“Eat slowly. You’ll get sick like that.”

After carefully wiping her mouth, he effortlessly took the cutlery from her hands and began cutting her food himself—perhaps pitying the sight. Then, with practiced ease, he lifted the fork to feed her.

Lisbell stared at the fork he held up, then slowly opened her mouth. Ulrich, pleased, didn’t hide how happy he was. He smiled often and even hummed a little now and then.

Like a baby bird, she accepted the food, then glanced sideways. She had sensed sharp stares earlier, and sure enough, two guests at a distant table were whispering as they watched. Judging by their flushed expressions whenever they glanced at Ulrich, the scene must’ve looked blissful to them.

Was that how it looked to everyone?

Even in this wretched state, simply being next to a man carved from stone like him—did it really make her appear serene and beautiful?

“Ugh…”

Suddenly, a wave of nausea surged. Lisbell turned away and covered her mouth. A sharp clatter echoed as Ulrich set down the cutlery and came around the table, gently patting her back.

But his touch only made her sicker. She couldn’t believe this was the same hand that once strangled her, shattered her ankles. That duality was so repulsive, she felt like filth was being poured over her back.

“Wait here for a moment.”

When her condition didn’t quickly improve, Ulrich stroked the back of her head once and left the table. Curling in on herself, she panted for breath, then wiped her lips with the back of her hand and reached for the glass of water beside her.

Her nausea eased the moment he disappeared, confirming it had been his presence triggering it. It made sense. He was utterly revolting. The fact that her reshaped, repurposed self—molded to fit the Althahart frame—seemed “normal” just by standing next to him was so infuriating and absurd, she could weep blood.

“…Ha.”

Realizing she was sitting across from the very man who had caused it all made her let out a laugh—dry and empty. It didn’t last long, her energy already drained. Lisbell turned her hollow gaze toward the window.

Ah…

It was dazzling.

The light had been pouring in since earlier, thanks to the sunny seat they’d chosen.

She wished that light would shatter her into pieces. That the beams would bore tiny holes into her body until she faded away—smaller and smaller, like grains of sand, crumbling gently into oblivion, leaving nothing behind.

Then she wouldn’t have to sit here, fighting the urge to vomit. Wouldn’t be a spectacle for strangers. Wouldn’t have to choke down food she couldn’t even taste…



She knew it was a hopeless wish, yet still, it pained her. Lisbell bit the inside of her cheek hard and turned her head. Just in time to see Ulrich returning to the table. His previously hurried steps relaxed as he saw she had calmed, returning to his usual composed air.

Thud.

Something bumped into his leg.

A little girl, small enough that her head didn’t even reach his waist, had stumbled against him. She fell backward from the impact, and the teddy bear she held—adorned with a red ribbon around its neck—rolled to the floor at Ulrich’s feet.

The sudden obstacle brought him to a stop. After a moment, he knelt and gently helped the girl up. Then he picked up the fallen toy and handed it back to her with a kind smile that masked his true nature.

He even patted her head as she shyly murmured something in return—her voice barely audible.

Lisbell’s eyes were filled with that image—so vividly, so completely. And then, it twisted and twisted until it finally shattered with a crack. The nausea she had just managed to suppress seemed to surge back. Or perhaps it wasn’t nausea at all—perhaps it was something else. Something undefined was pounding in her chest as if trying to crush her heart.

Thump, thump.

Thump, thump.

Thump, thump.

He’s kind…

He smiled gently at the child.

So kind…

He picked up the stuffed toy that had fallen at his feet.

To a child—he did.

…Why?

Thump.

A strange reverberation.

Like something was scratching—or collapsing inside her.

Only now did she realize: it wasn’t her heartbeat. It was the sound of a seed, deeply planted in her core, sprouting into life—the seed of doubt.

Lisbell suddenly jumped to her feet. Ulrich turned toward her at the abrupt movement. She instinctively stepped back, like she wanted to evaporate from his steel-blue eyes that clung to her. Sensing something was off, Ulrich quickly approached the table.

“Lisbell.”

“Ah, I… I…”

“What’s wrong?”

“I… I’m leaving.”

“Lisbell?”

“I have to go… I’m leaving. I’m leaving. I’m leaving! Let go—let go of me! I have to go. I have to—hah—I have to!”

Lisbell violently shook off his grasp, pushing the chair back at random. Her legs gave out, and she fell to the floor, hitting the table and sending dishes crashing to the ground. Shouts of surprise came from all around.

As she tried to crawl away, Ulrich barely managed to hold her back. She thrashed like someone blinded, hitting and pushing against his chest and shoulders. Her screams were soaked with a wet, gasping sob.

“Let go! I have to go! I can’t stay here—I, I… Aagh! AAH!”

Out of her mind, Lisbell shoved her head under the table and screamed. Realizing something was seriously wrong, Ulrich turned his head. Victor, who had been waiting nearby during the meal, quickly came over and handed him a syringe he’d prepared just in case.

Ulrich rolled up her sleeve, found her inner arm, and inserted the needle. Lisbell, wailing and thrashing as if the world around her didn’t exist, began to quiet as her eyelids gradually sank. Not long after, they closed completely, and her limbs fell limp.

“I’ll take her upstairs. Clean this up.”

“Yes, young master.”

Leaving the chaotic mess to his secretary, Ulrich carried her back to the room.

The tranquilizer kept Lisbell asleep until deep into the dark night. When she finally opened her eyes, tears—she didn’t even know had gathered—slid silently down her cheeks. As she moved to wipe them away, a voice came through the darkness.

“Lisbell.”

Instead of replying, she coughed faintly. Ulrich, in a shirt and trousers, came over from the side table, where he had likely been working, and helped her sit up. Then he handed her a glass of water. As she sipped to ease her dry throat, he spoke again.

“You’re in the room.”



“Your condition suddenly got worse, so I gave you a sedative. Do you remember?”

“…Yes.”

She answered in a voice that barely came out. Ulrich took the empty glass from her and gave her a quick glance.

“How are you feeling now?”

His eyes searched her face for signs. But Lisbell didn’t respond. Instead, she looked at him quietly in the dim light.

Ulrich never asked questions. Not once, no matter when or how her breakdowns came, no matter how wild and irrational—he never asked why. Even as he rushed to administer tranquilizers before anyone else could react, he never once asked what had triggered her or what the reason was this time.

Until now, she hadn’t thought much of that silence. But suddenly, it stood out—so sharply, so unbearably—that she could no longer ignore it.

A chill spread through her, deep and cold.

“…The toy.”

“Hm?”

“That… from earlier.”

“What about it?”

“I want it.”



“The teddy bear…”

 Ulrich didn’t say anything—it must have been something he didn’t expect at all. Just for a moment, he ran a hand across his mouth, as if collecting his thoughts, then slowly spoke.

“The teddy bear… is it?”



“Alright. Got it.”

With that gentle response, he softly touched Lisbell’s forehead and cheek. It seemed like he was checking if she had a fever, likely thinking she was babbling nonsense under the influence of sudden heat. Lisbell didn’t bother to confirm or deny. Instead, she slowly lay back down.

“The teddy bear…”

Ulrich murmured to himself, clearly still surprised, then let out a small chuckle. His cool fingers tickled her bangs for a moment before retreating.

She had just woken up, and it didn’t seem likely she’d fall asleep again so easily—but once her eyes closed, drowsiness quickly took hold. She didn’t bother to question what was luring her back into sleep.

A few days later, several boxes were delivered to the hotel. While working in his office, Ulrich moved to another room at Victor’s call and gave a wry laugh at the mountain of boxes stacked before him.

“This many?”

“Since we didn’t specify the purpose to the department store, they sent a variety—gift sets, display pieces, collector’s items… all kinds.”

“Well, more options aren’t a bad thing. Open them one by one.”

Victor joined the staff already unpacking. One by one, the teddy bears, carefully wrapped to keep them clean, were taken out of the boxes. Ulrich looked at the parade of bears with a detached expression, then picked up one with a thin, long red ribbon tied into a bow at its neck—similar to the one held by the girl they had seen in the lounge.

“Let’s go with this one. Store the rest for now.”

“Yes, sir.”

Without much deliberation, Ulrich took the chosen bear and returned to the guest room. The moment he opened the door, a profound stillness washed over him. Without bothering to check the rest of the room, he headed straight to the bed. As expected, Lisbell was lying there, sound asleep.

He had planned to leave the teddy bear by her pillow as a surprise for when she woke—but maybe she was only lightly asleep. The moment she sensed someone nearby, Lisbell stirred under the blanket. As he waited quietly, she slowly opened her eyes.

“Did you sleep well?”

With a warm greeting, Ulrich held the teddy bear up in front of her face. Lisbell blinked slowly, staring blankly at the stuffed animal. Ulrich gently wobbled the bear side to side, just like one would with a child.

“A gift.”



“You said you wanted it, remember?”

Lisbell pulled her hand out from under the blanket and gripped the bear. It was a response, but an uncertain one. Her face showed no joy—so much so that it went beyond indifference and almost seemed like she’d been handed an unwanted burden.

Her hollow, violet eyes eventually turned slowly toward his face.

“Why are you looking at me like that?”



“You don’t like it?”

As he teased lightly, Lisbell stared at him for a long moment, then shook her head slowly. She fiddled with the bear’s thickly stitched black paw a few times, then, as if bored, suddenly pushed it away and buried herself under the blanket again.

Watching quietly, Ulrich tilted his head. He hadn’t expected an overjoyed reaction—but this wasn’t disappointment either. It was a vague, unreadable reaction that didn’t fit any label.

He was tempted to pull her up and demand an answer, but Lisbell had already dozed off again, letting out faint breaths. Feeling strangely unsatisfied, Ulrich gently brushed aside her hair and then stood up.

As he stepped out of the room, Victor, who had been waiting outside, approached.

“Did she like it?”

“Not sure…”

“Sir?”

Ulrich glanced back toward the room and said:

“Move everything that arrived today into the room.”

“All of it… sir?”

“All of it.”

Victor looked baffled but agreed. Afterward, Ulrich returned to his regular work with Victor assisting as usual. The sun that had lit the day gradually dipped lower, and dusk began to creep in like it meant to consume the world whole.

As Ulrich ascended the stairs to return to the room, he thought: by now, the guest room would be filled with teddy bears. What kind of reaction would Lisbell show at the childish display? It would surely be more expressive than that vague emptiness from before.

He imagined it as he climbed the stairs—one step at a time.

Ulrich’s steps suddenly came to a halt. The voice of Victor, who had been following behind and listing matters that needed Ulrich’s attention, also stopped mid-sentence.

Both men’s eyes fixated on the same spot.

In front of the closed guest room door, someone was anxiously shifting from foot to foot for some unknown reason. It was Lisbell’s personal attendant—assigned to assist her with meals, bathing, and other needs. There could only be one reason for someone like that to appear so nervous. Something had happened concerning Lisbell.

Victor, recovering faster than Ulrich, hurried ahead and grabbed the attendant to question him.

“What’s going on?”

“I… um… that is…”

“Is there a problem with Miss Osborne?”

“It’s not… anything major. Just…”

The attendant hesitated, clearly unsure how to phrase things.

A seizure, maybe? No—that couldn’t be it. If it were, someone would’ve already come running to report it. This wasn’t the first time something like that had happened. So what else could possibly make the attendant act like this?

Victor’s pondering led nowhere. Ulrich, who had followed them up the stairs, walked past them without a word and opened the guest room door.

The room was filled with a deep crimson glow of sunset. Inside, there were usually only two sounds: a sharp, piercing voice that seemed to torture her own eardrums, or faint breathing so subtle it was hard to catch unless one paid close attention—like from someone in a deathlike sleep.

But today, what Ulrich heard was an entirely unfamiliar sound.

Rip.

Something being torn apart.

Tear.

A sound like fabric being shredded.

Plop. Thud.

The sound of something bursting or dropping.

Those sounds overlapped occasionally, echoing faintly.

The room was soaked in sunset light so red it could’ve been a sea of blood. Perhaps that was why the sounds, usually easy to ignore, crawled their way insistently into Ulrich’s ears.

Then, something rolled to his feet.

He looked down quietly. It was a torn-off short arm, white stuffing bursting from the tear. It didn’t take long for him to realize—it was part of the teddy bear he had ordered brought into the room today.

Rip, rip.

The sound of fabric continued being torn. Ulrich slowly raised his head.

In the blazing red backdrop, he saw a figure slumped lifelessly on the floor. The stillness of her posture made her look like a corpse engulfed in flames.

Ulrich’s feet slowly moved toward her.

On the way, he saw arms and legs—unclear when they had been torn off—scattered about. Sometimes it was a head. Sometimes it was decorative ribbons or beads. White tufts of stuffing were splattered all over, soaked in the bloody hue of the sunset.

At last, he reached the scorched corpse that only her hands still moved.

At that moment, Lisbell violently yanked at the head of a round teddy bear. With her crude grip, the head tore off with a sickening sound. Despite her frail, thin body, the other hand ripped an arm sideways with surprising force and flung it away without a glance. A pile of similarly dismembered limbs had already formed nearby like a heap of corpses.

Rip, tear, pop.

Those grotesque sounds were all birthed from Lisbell’s hands. There were only a few teddy bears left intact around her. The number of mutilated limbs along the path alone was evidence of her relentless destruction.

After brutally destroying the one in her hands, she reached for the next target—but stopped midway. Her head slowly turned.

Her face was unusually flushed. It wasn’t just the teddy bears that were stained by the burning sunset. She too was glowing in raw, saturated red.

As their eyes met, Lisbell let out a confused, half-finished sound.

“Uh…”

“Why?”



“Why do you… look like that?”

The hand that had halted its massacre began to move again, sluggishly. Without breaking eye contact with Ulrich, her sunset-hazed gaze unwavering, she gripped the belly of a new teddy bear with both hands and pulled forcefully.

“You said you’d do this for me…”

 They sat facing each other in silence, not exchanging a single word. Lisbell, gripping the doll’s belly that stuck out like cotton, and Ulrich, gazing at her, seemed as if they were in a scene frozen in time. It was so still that it felt like they had all died, with each second stretching unnaturally long.

The first to move was Ulrich. He kneeled and aligned his gaze with Lisbell’s, then gently took her wrist in his hand.

“Your hand, is it hurt?”

The hand that might have snatched the doll away instead only checked on her, tenderly, as if signaling he never intended to stop her. Without hesitation, he withdrew.

Lisbell continued to stare at him without breaking eye contact. Ulrich met her gaze boldly and smiled slightly.

“So… do you feel a bit relieved now?”



“If it’s still not enough, I can bring more.”



“If you want, I’ll even move the entire doll store from the department store for you.”

Ulrich smiled slyly, as if saying she could have whatever she wished for. His charm was so smooth, there wasn’t a hint of discomfort. Lisbell, with a blank expression, threw the bear doll carelessly.

“Enough.”

Seemingly drained of all will, Lisbell tossed the bear’s shredded remains aside, climbed into bed, and pulled the blanket over herself lazily, lying down in the same way as before.

Ulrich, heading toward the door, gave orders to clean up the chaotic room.

As others moved quietly and busily in and out of the bedroom, Lisbell remained unmoving, her blanket pulled up to her neck. Soon, the bed tilted slightly. The only person who could get into her bed was one: Ulrich. Lisbell unconsciously closed her eyes.

Ulrich’s hand slithered under the blanket like a silk snake, touching her stomach. The cold touch grazed her skin, and after a few strange actions, he withdrew.

After fixing the disheveled blanket, Ulrich stepped away. The bed, which had been slightly tilted, returned to its original position. Lisbell slowly opened her eyes.

She continued to gaze at the side.

In an environment so comfortable, she could not shake the discomfort in her heart. Cold sweat, like a chill, ran down her back.

Thump, thump. The strange, persistent sound in her chest refused to fade.

She still couldn’t understand the man’s intentions.

Did he truly intend to make her stomach flat again?

The silent mental torment continued, leaving her uncertain and uneasy.

A loud, piercing cry woke her up. As soon as she opened her eyes, she found herself surrounded by pitch-black darkness. There was no light anywhere, just a world colored in black, with no indication of up, down, front, or back.

Another sharp cry assaulted her ears, and Lisbell felt a searing pain, as if her body had been torn apart. Before she could even curl her fingers, she screamed, but no sound returned.

Her twisted gaze fell downward, and she saw something perched on her swollen belly.

Flap, flap.

The flapping wings slowly diminished, and the dark, gloomy head bowed.

The next cry was shorter, followed by the sound of a drop of blood hitting the ground, splashing like rain.

Lisbell muttered a foolish sound, but it quickly faded into nothingness. The crow perched on her belly began tearing into her insides, pecking at her organs.

It was a brutal scene, too grotesque to bear. She struggled against the ropes, but they held her firmly in place. The crow spread its wings wide, seemingly enjoying her distress.

Screaming, Lisbell felt her consciousness slipping away, her pain intensifying, but no one came to help. She watched helplessly as her organs were consumed, her body deteriorating, and the crow grew stronger with every passing moment.

The more she died, the more the crow thrived, and the realization of this tragic fate made her feel powerless and despairing.

Her senses faded, and all she could feel was the overwhelming pain. Through her blurred vision, she saw the crow’s beak glistening with blood as it pecked at something between her ribs.

She realized then that the beating heart wasn’t hers.



Suddenly, she came to consciousness.

 

“Ugh….”

 

As soon as Lisbell woke up from her dream, she inhaled heavily like someone suffering from hypoxia. However, she did not feel full at all. As soon as she inhaled, her breath became rapid as if it was being sucked out through the pores of her body. The feeling of her hair, soaked in cold sweat, sticking to her skin was creepy.

 

After a while, she realized that she was lying down looking at the ceiling.

 

Recently, Lisbell had been unable to lie down in this position. Her stomach, which had grown so large that it seemed impossible to hide it any longer, was pressing down on her limbs like a rock. She could not sleep properly in this position, her stomach would often turn inside out, and she would constantly feel the need to urinate.

 

Although lying on her side would have helped her somewhat, she did not do so and barely sat up with her trembling arms.

 

She looked blankly at the window.

 

It was a quiet night, hard to find natural light, and I was alone in the bedroom. The man had not yet returned. If he had, he would have already slept next to me or done something else. Even though I tried to sit still and focus on the quietness of the room where I was alone, a part of my mind kept drifting apart. A chilling blue energy that I could not shake off with my consciousness suddenly rose up and surrounded my chest.

 

It was unpleasant.

 

Lisbell rarely had dreams. But there was a day when she had a vivid dream like today.

 

A crow had appeared there too. She screamed with all her might, but it did not reach anyone, and the sky and the ground were fiercely black as if covered in black raw materials. On that day, when she had a nightmare that made her sweat as she recalled it, Lisbell had captured the circumstances surrounding her mother’s death.

 

Thinking back, it might not have been unpleasantness but ominousness.

 

Because everything was so similar.

 

The crow’s eyes, which looked back at her while biting her heart, which was smaller than her fist, still had a splendid color. Now, just looking at it made her feel like drowning… .

 

The cold sweat on his body gradually cooled down and an uncontrollable coldness came rushing in. As she looked at the room that had been cleaned up in the gloom that made her want to deny reality, the man’s voice came back to her.

 

“Your hand, isn’t it hurt?”

 

It was a voice that seemed to be worried that she might have been hurt. How hypocritical.

 To be clear, she hadn’t intended for things to go this far.

What Lisbell did with the teddy bear had merely been to jolt him into awareness—to remind him of the promise he had made to her.

He had vowed to restore her belly to its former, flat state.

The reason she crawled out from under the narrow, dark table and approached him on her knees was born from that single, desperate desire.

Afterward, she stopped thinking as much as she used to.

Even so, her head would sometimes feel unbearably heavy, and the threshold for her thoughts to spiral had lowered.

Because she was still alive—still breathing—those inevitable thoughts would occasionally rise up like tiny bubbles, then surge into overwhelming waves that crashed down on her.

Whenever that happened, all that remained inside her was burning impulsiveness, leaving her unable to control her own actions.

Lately, there had been exactly one thing that could send her into such a state.

Lisbell’s gaze dropped downward.

Even standing straight, she could no longer see her own feet.

Her swollen belly blocked the view that should have been wide open before her.

He had promised to make it go away.

If he were truly the man who could do anything in her world, then it should have been gone already.

But it remained, stubborn and heavy, anchoring her limbs to the ground. And so Lisbell was in pain. Her wishes had always been simple, unchanged from the beginning—she just wanted a little comfort. She had even crawled across the floor, bruising her knees, in order to put an end to the pain that bound him. Yet all she received in return was the prolongation of that pain.

Moreover, Ulrich had shown glimpses—at times, in ways she couldn’t help but notice—of something unreadable and troubling.

Lisbell clenched her fists. It was clear that all she had left were impulsiveness and frustration. And putting an end to this dragging, miserable process was something she herself could do.

In truth, there was no need to drag things out. There was a quicker way to reach the peace she so desperately sought.

Silently, she moved toward the window of the guest room.

Outside the square window, pale yellow leaves were quietly falling. She had wondered why it had become so cold all of a sudden—only to realize that it was already the height of autumn. The time between the retreating summer and the coming winter. Whether she had intended it or not, whether she had been conscious of it or not, she had once again gotten trapped in a gap between seasons.

‘…What floor was this again?’

High enough to see the thin branches of the towering trees.
Her gaze slid down to the window frame.
Unlike the windows at the Alta Hart mansion, there was no additional lock installed here.
If she pressed down with a little strength, the window would open easily.

‘So if I fall from here…’

It would end.

‘Whether my head shatters, or my belly bursts…’

If she let go of everything like that, it would all be over.

If she could only leap voluntarily into that unknown, death that held no hesitation—

Then it would end.

But—



Lisbell could not go through with it.

Because—

I would just fail again.

Just as someone once said, she was full of thoughts, but even fuller of fear. Even now, she couldn’t help but imagine what would happen if her attempt at death failed.

What if she only ended up critically injured but survived miraculously? What if Ulrich, enraged by her actions, decided to revoke his promise to her? What if she was left, as she had been before when caught by his wife, unable to move freely and forced to await the day of her delivery?

Would today really be the first time she had been seized by such extreme urges? She had harbored them countless times. Whenever she saw a tall staircase, she thought about hurling herself down it; whenever she saw a dish, she wondered about smashing it and using a shard to slit her throat.

These impulses crept in as naturally as breathing for someone still alive.

And sadly, every single time, she arrived at the same conclusion:

She didn’t have the courage to endure what would happen if she failed. And so, she couldn’t even truly wish for death.

“…Haha.”

A hollow laugh slipped from her lips.

It was absurd.

To think there could exist a fear greater than death.

Wasn’t everything supposed to end once she died? And yet, she kept finding herself staring beyond that end.

Perhaps at the root of it all, there was a damp, heavy despair she had acquired after enduring so many situations. It was the sabotage of defeat, carved deep into her bones.

Having never once tasted a victory against Ulrich, Lisbell knew only this kind of bitter, pessimistic psychology. It awakened her dread, severed her thoughts before they could go any further, and left her trembling.

Shivering uncontrollably from the sudden cold, Lisbell hugged her arms around herself. She stumbled back to the bed and buried herself under the covers, pulling them up over her head. Underneath the blanket, she lay utterly still, like a stone.

Before long, she heard the quiet sound of the door opening. Ulrich had returned from his outing. Even as the faint sense of his presence approached, Lisbell stared blankly ahead, as if she could neither see nor hear him.

“Hm?”

A curious voice sounded from behind her. It was the reaction of a man who, upon stepping into the dark, unlit bedroom, had discovered her sitting ghostlike under a heap of blankets. Apparently, he had assumed she would be asleep again, just as she had been for days now, barely awake long enough to see him.

He loosened his tie with a finger and, abandoning his path toward the dressing room, instead approached the bed and sat down. Then, like someone amused by something he had found, he laughed lightly.

“Why are you sitting so cutely like that?”

Even as he came closer, Lisbell’s eyes, which had been staring into empty space, slowly moved toward him. With a faint, hollow expression, like a person stripped of all emotions, she looked up at him—

and with a voice barely above a whisper, finally spoke.

“…I woke up because it hurt.”

“Where does it hurt?”

“My belly…”

Ulrich looked like he was about to ask something else, his lips parting slightly—but then he shut his mouth. Lisbell did the same.

Whenever this topic came up, an indescribable silence always settled between them first.

With her lips pressed shut, Lisbell studied his face.

Ulrich, at some point, lifted the gaze he had lowered.

“Does it hurt a lot?”

Lisbell gave no immediate response. After a long moment, she shook her head slightly. He kissed her forehead, where it peeked through her hair, and whispered,

“I’ll have them bring you some warm tea. Stay lying down.”

Then he stood and made his way back toward the door.

Even though he had told her to lie down, Lisbell didn’t.

She remained exactly where she was, her eyes fixed on the same spot.

But when Ulrich, after giving his instructions, returned to the bed, she turned to look at him again.

He noticed her persistent gaze and teased her lightly, as if pinching at the invisible thread of her attention.

“What are you staring at like that?”

“…Your eyes.”

“Hm?”

“Your eyes.”

Those eyes that glowed blue even in the dark of the night. He looked like a crow from somewhere, covered head to toe in black feathers, with only his eyes shining so coldly and pale. Recalling that image made the dull, stabbing pain in the lower part of her belly throb heavier.

“My eyes?”

Ulrich, seeming not the least bit displeased by her interest, leaned in even closer, almost bringing his face right up to hers.

“Do you like them?”

Not stopping there, he even chuckled softly. Seeing herself reflected and rippling in his blue irises made Lisbell feel sick, so she tore her gaze away.
Ulrich found even that amusing; he chuckled again and left a soft butterfly kiss on her temple before leaning back against the bed’s headboard.

He tugged the loosened tie all the way off, reached out, and fumbled for something on the bedside table. A sharp metallic sound rang out. He had opened a cigarette case, pulled out a cigarette, and placed it between his lips. The motion of his hand moving naturally to light it stopped abruptly, like a short circuit.

As if he had suddenly realized—Oh, right.

Lisbell instantly understood the cause of that hesitation. She didn’t have to think hard about it. Because in the next second, Ulrich cast a quick glance toward her while holding the cigarette between two fingers.

At the moment their eyes met, at the moment he lowered the cigarette from his lips, at the moment he acted as if it were nothing, casually smoothing things over—

Those three blows struck Lisbell like a brutal, merciless beating.

“…Why aren’t you smoking?”

It felt like she had slipped off a crumbling cliff’s edge. The ground that had been holding her heart up gave way with a crash. From that gaping crack, doubts—sharp as thorns and growing long like whips—sprang up furiously, vicious enough to overturn her insides.

Ulrich, who had been idly focused on the bedside table, turned back to her at the sudden accusation. Lisbell’s face was half vacant, almost dazed.

“Why… aren’t you smoking…”

Her words dragged downward, drooping heavily. It was because her voice had started trembling uncontrollably.

“Lisbell?”

“…Because it’s harmful?”



“To me… no, no—to this baby…”

Her delicate features crumbled all at once. Her breath came shorter, more frantically, more wretchedly.

 Lisbell reached out with a broken expression on her face, grabbing the pillow that had fallen to the floor.

“You…”

By the time she dragged it up to her knees, her expression had already turned terrifying.

“You lied to me.”



“You lied to me…!”



“You lied to me! You lied to me…!!”

Lisbell slammed the pillow down on his forearm. In the violent motion, the blanket she had been wrapped in slid down her body. Her body, trembling uncontrollably from the pent-up emotions, became more noticeable.

Ulrich, who hadn’t reacted to the sudden situation at first, quickly grabbed the pillow as if it were going to strike his face.

“Lisbell, wait.”

“You lied to me…! You… you lied to me, didn’t you…! You did, didn’t you?!”

The force behind her refusal to let this go was overwhelming. Ulrich could already see Lisbell’s face, flushed and out of breath, struggling to hold herself together. Her pupils were wide and trembling, a clear sign that something was seriously wrong with her.

He tried to maintain control of the situation, using just enough force to remove the pillow without causing her further strain. Lisbell, however, continued to swing the pillow wildly, hitting him across the cheek and chest.

“What’s going on all of a sudden?”

“I thought… I thought something was wrong.”



“Why did you laugh like that when you looked at a child? Why did you suddenly embrace me so gently? Why did you stroke my belly like it was something precious? Why… why do you refuse to smoke in front of me… Why… why…!!”

The doubts she had been accumulating exploded all at once. The impact was immense. Every last bit of reason she had was shattered, her mind completely thrown into disarray. Her chest felt like it was engulfed in molten lava, as if betrayal and anger were spilling over, causing her vision to throb painfully.

“It was all… a lie. You said you’d… do what I wanted…! You said you wouldn’t make me have the baby…! You promised me… you promised you’d get rid of it…! You promised!”

She didn’t believe it. She should have trusted the person she should have trusted. Instead, she had trusted the one she should never have.

Her heart, as fragile as glass, collapsed, falling deeper and deeper into darkness. She felt as though her insides had been trampled and torn apart, suffocated by an overwhelming hatred.

“And still… you lied to me…! Again! You lied to me again! Again!”

Lisbell had completely lost her reason. She twisted and flailed her limbs violently, like a beast.

The pillow she had been swinging was finally ripped from her hands. Now, Lisbell used both her arms to attack him. Her nails, which had once dug into her neck and now mercilessly scratched at her swollen belly, tore into Ulrich’s cheek and jaw.

Crimson lines appeared on his fair skin. Despite this, Ulrich’s eyes remained unwavering, as if nothing could shake him. She hated it. His eyes, still pristine and untainted, were the exact opposite of her, who was falling apart.

“I… I’ll…”

In her frantic struggle, Lisbell almost fell off the bed, but Ulrich managed to catch her just in time. Twisting in desperation, Lisbell reached for his throat.

“I’ll… kill you…”

Lisbell poured all her energy into fighting him, but as she pushed against his thick arms, which seemed like solid walls, she resorted to biting him, sinking her teeth into his flesh with a vicious snap.

“This time, I’ll kill you!”

At that moment, the door to the room opened.

The servant, who had been bringing in a tray with tea at Ulrich’s instruction, was startled by the chaotic scene and hesitated, before quickly turning to leave. Soon after, footsteps could be heard running toward the room.

“Let go! Let go of me! I’ll kill you…! I will! You… you lied to me… you… you’re trying to torment me again… you played with me, didn’t you… I won’t let this go… I’ll never let you get away with this!”

“Lisbell.”

As the two struggled, Victor, who had been called for, quickly retrieved a box of sedatives. Lisbell, as if trying to completely destroy her voice, continued to scream with vicious intent, cursing him with every word.

“Why… why is this happening to me… I’ll kill you… I won’t forgive you. I won’t let you go… Everything… everything disgusts me. I hate it…! Why… why are you doing this to me…!”

“Lisbell!”

A hand, veins bulging, grabbed her shoulder tightly.

Victor, who had been hastily filling the syringe with liquid, looked up in surprise and turned toward the bed. It wasn’t just him. The voice was unfamiliar to everyone in the room.

Ulrich’s low, rolling voice, always sweet and pleasant, had never sounded so rough, so firm, as if he were shouting. It was something no one had ever heard before.

Even Lisbell, whose emotions had been torn to shreds, flinched helplessly.

Ulrich held her shoulder tightly, his voice sharp as ice.

“I told you I’d take care of it.”



“Why don’t you trust me?”

His voice was clearly coming from directly in front of her, yet there was a strange sense of pressure surrounding it, making it feel as though it were descending from above. It made her involuntarily lower her head and drop her gaze. It was a highly oppressive, almost delicately violent kind of pressure.

It wasn’t just his voice that was creating this sense of domination.

Unlike Lisbell, who could only tremble weakly, his pale blue eyes were firm and resolute. Even with their soft color, they radiated an unsettling, chilling uniqueness that couldn’t be ignored.

With a single, cutting remark, the entire bedroom froze.

Everyone stood still, as though enchanted, unable to move. The first to break the silence, however, was Lisbell.

“How…”

Her facial features, strained and twisted with too much force, contorted. The furious, overwhelming anger that had driven her to lose her senses faded, leaving only a whimper from the broken, crumpled inner turmoil.

“How… How could this… happen…?”



“It’s already… this big…”

Lisbell’s body, still held tightly by Ulrich, lowered slightly.

“I know… there’s not much time left, but how…”

She could not ignore the feeling of pressure, even in her crouched position. The pain in her stomach was sharp, piercing from the inside. It wasn’t just her own discomfort. There was something inside her, something that clung to her fiercely, unwilling to let go…

“I never… trusted you…”

Through her bitter sobs, the broken tone of her voice came in scattered fragments.

“At that time… I should have just pressed the gun to my head… No, no… in the monastery… I should have hung myself there so I’d never leave… No, even before that… I should’ve just… just died with my mother…”



“I should’ve ended it all back then…”

In the once icy atmosphere of the bedroom, the only sound now was the sorrowful, heart-wrenching cry that filled the space.

Lisbell wept uncontrollably, muttering words of despair, as if she had lost all hope for the future.

Ulrich, his face scratched from where she had clawed at him, looked down at her before pulling her closer. Her body, weakened from the emotional turmoil, followed without resistance, as if it had lost its center of balance. For a moment, it almost felt like she was being dragged like a prisoner.

With her face resting on the man’s legs, Lisbell curled her arms and legs, as if trying to return to the original state of things, and wept quietly.

“I don’t want to give birth…”



“I don’t want to… I don’t want to give birth… I don’t want to… I don’t want to… Ugh… I don’t… I don’t want to…”

Her actions, hugging her now obvious, fully visible belly, as tears streamed down uncontrollably, caused everyone in the room to remain silent. None of them dared to speak. It was more accurate to say that they couldn’t.

Ulrich, who was watching the wretched scene from closer than anyone else, gestured silently. Victor, who had been standing by on one side, noticed and set the syringe down. Then he instructed the other attendants who had been waiting with him to leave the room.

 

Lisbell cried until her throat was raw, then fainted from exhaustion. Perhaps the surge of sorrow that had been pent up inside her finally burst forth, because soon after, a fever took hold of her. It was a cold.

 

Ulrich postponed all his scheduled plans and cared for her for several days. That way, he was always by her side whenever Lisbell regained consciousness, even if only briefly, while suffering a severe fever that made her ramble in her sleep.

 

When she woke drenched in cold sweat, Lisbell would look at him with clouded, cracked eyes and, as if possessed, open her mouth.

 

One day—

 

“Mother…”

 

Calling him that, she voluntarily threw herself into his arms with limbs that creaked as they moved.

 

“Mother, it hurts so much…”

 



 

“My stomach… it’s so heavy… I can’t breathe, I’m dying… Please save me. Please, save me… Mother. I… it’s too hard. It really is… too much…”

 

In that way, she called out to the late Madam Osborne, and on another day—

 

“Theo…?”

 

She searched for her former fiancé, whom Ulrich had once impersonated while hiding in the darkness.

 

“Theo… Theo? Theo. Hey, I’m sorry. I’m really sorry. So please, stop. I’ve had enough. I’m already hurting so much. I… I’m sorry. I’m sorry… okay?”

 

She pleaded for salvation from one and apologized repeatedly to another. Whether it was a fever-induced hallucination or a mental collapse finally breaking through after being driven to the edge, no one could tell, but it was clearly not normal.

 

Yet Ulrich did not reject Lisbell when she mistook him for someone else and embraced him. As if it were the most natural thing, he held her, gently wiping the sweat from her forehead and the tear-stained cheeks.

 

“Stop crying.”

 



 

“I told you I’m weak to your crying face.”

 

She thought she heard him say that in her unconscious state, though she couldn’t be sure. Not just that—he seemed to repeatedly whisper that it was okay, that she needn’t worry, that she should rest easy and sleep well.

 

It was caring, but somehow lacking something. Perhaps that was why his comfort always came across as irresponsibly gentle, pushing her deeper into sleep again and again. Her mind faded into a fog, limbs wrapped tight as if being dragged somewhere. The sensation wasn’t of slowly sinking, but of falling. The feeling of descent now seemed almost normal.

 

And so, Lisbell was bedridden for a full two weeks.

 

When the burning fever finally subsided and her blurry consciousness returned to its place, the morning light streaming in felt incredibly pure. It wouldn’t have been strange if the first snow, the color of clouds, had fallen from the sky at that very moment.

 



 

The bedroom was deathly quiet, but Lisbell instantly knew there was a man lying beside her. She could feel the familiar hand that had been wiping her down, the one now toying gently with her loose, overgrown hair—twisting the ends, then letting them fall.

 

Lisbell didn’t reject the touch. She just stared into the blinding sunlight until she couldn’t take it anymore, and closed her eyes as if fleeing.

 

Then she slowly moved her lips.

 

“I’ll do everything…”

 

The hand playing with her hair froze.

 

“If you want me to stay by your side… I will. If you want me to be your spring bride… I’ll do that too. If you want me to pretend to love you like before… I can do that too…”

 



 

“I can do it all…”

 



 

“So, just this one thing…”

 

Tears, which she thought she had no more of, welled up again, cutting through her chest.

 

“Please, just… this one thing…”

 

Even with her eyes closed, she could feel the wetness spreading.

 

Because, because—

 

“Lisbell, how many times do I have to say the same thing?”

 



 

“I told you. Leave it to me.”

 

Hope had long since turned into a discarded scrap. Even hearing such words from a man who once believed anything was possible in this world, she no longer felt the desire to lean on him. She couldn’t rely on him—she had to accept that.

 

By then, Lisbell clearly realized that what she had tried so hard to hold on to was nothing but blind hope. Even with that realization, she didn’t get angry or lash out like before. Because no matter how much her trust had been shattered, the truth remained that he was the only one she had left to hold on to. Even if it was hope wrapped in lies.

 

In a way, she had begun to surrender completely. Her dreams, her future, her will, and everything else…

 

Ah, it had been a long time since she felt this itchy sensation in her throat.

 

‘No…’

 

It wasn’t her throat. Maybe it was her awkwardly protruding belly, or her twig-thin, dried-up ankles. The itching spread like invisible bugs crawling over every inch of her skin. If she could, she would have scratched herself raw with both hands.

 

But Lisbell didn’t touch a single part of her body. She only curled herself slightly inward.

 

The fact that she didn’t even have the energy left to do such a simple thing made one truth blindingly clear:

 

She was going to give birth.

 

She was—

 

—to this child.

 

Death would have been much better…

 

Day by day passed like fleeting moments, as if the absolute and physical concept of time had finally broken down.

 

A day could feel like a minute, and sometimes a minute like a week. After time had stretched and contracted in such chaotic and arbitrary ways, what came was overwhelming pain.

 

One night, Lisbell woke up screaming, her entire body drenched in cold sweat.

 

Perhaps she had never truly been asleep. The relentless thudding in her belly, like someone pounding her from the inside—thud, thud, thud—never ceased, making restful sleep impossible.

 

Once she became conscious of it, the pain surged out of control. Her stomach felt like it would tear apart. It was as if someone was stabbing near her navel with an awl as thick as an arm, slicing through her flesh.

 

Her mind quickly turned hazy. Lights in the once-dark bedroom flickered on one by one, soon brightening the space like daylight. Her vision stung from the deluge of light.

 

Her body, unable even to breathe properly from the pain, was lifted and carried somewhere. Unlike the guest room she had stayed in through several seasons, the new space felt slightly chilly.

 

She couldn’t think. She had merely been lying down, relying on someone else to move her—and just like that, labor had begun. She screamed as someone touched her belly. It was an indescribably grotesque and horrifying sensation. She didn’t understand why she had to endure such extreme pain, and a fear crept in—that her belly might really explode, and she would die.

 

Hiccups… tears burst out, soaking her face. Someone gently touched her features. In a brief moment of clarity, she saw a long, black necktie hanging down. If she could, she would’ve grabbed it and strangled its owner with all her might.

 

Why did she have to suffer like this? She wanted the one who caused it to feel this unbearable pain too. But she couldn’t even try to reach out.

 

“Ahhh…! Hrrng…!”

 

Somewhere, an impatient voice told her to push harder. Lisbell shook her head reflexively. It was too much. The pain was unbearable. She felt like she was dying. Maybe she already was. Every nerve in her body screamed like it had come unmoored. Her muscles were cramping so badly they couldn’t function properly.

 

“It hurts, it hurts… it hurts… It hurts so much…”

 

The sobs caught in her throat, as if trying to block her airway. It felt like invisible hands were strangling her. Her face turned pale. Cold sweat had barely dried before it welled up again, trickling down her temples. Her face was soaked—she couldn’t even tell if it was from sweat or tears anymore.

 

Then, someone held her chin.

 

Something soft pressed against her lips. Only after feeling the gentle pressure did she realize it was lips. Ulrich had suddenly kissed her.

 

Lisbell, who had barely been sustaining her breath with shallow gasps, lost focus in her eyes.

 

Yes, maybe she was meant to wither and die. The thought had barely formed when Ulrich exhaled sharply into her. Unconsciously, she drew in that breath. Like artificial respiration, he breathed into her several more times before slowly pulling away.

 

“Breathe.”

 



 

“Don’t try to die on your own.”

 

It was strange. It was clearly a different phrase, with a different meaning, but it sounded to her as if he were telling her: Don’t think.

 

That binding brand he had seared into the very depths of her heart…

 

Lisbell stared at him blankly, then with trembling hands, she grabbed hold of his tie. Her hand, skin taut and bony, quivered visibly.

 

The next moment, a firm command to push rang out like a roar, and she screamed, giving everything she had to bear down from deep within. Again and again, she repeated the motion. Her vision blurred with the pain of life itself. Her breath reached her throat—then, with sudden exhaustion, it was yanked away.

 

It was the moment she pushed so hard she nearly passed out.

 

Waaah—

 

Waaahhh—

 

A strange and unfamiliar cry rang out. Perhaps it was the sound everyone in that room, except for one, had been waiting for.

Lisbell’s upper body, which had been propped up nearly upright, collapsed backward with a thud. Hah… She breathed so harshly her chest heaved, blankly staring at the ceiling. Sweat that had gathered at her temples streamed down between her cheeks and ears.

 

It was over. It was all over. And it didn’t just mean childbirth. That being—finally, inevitably—had come into the world. That was why it was over. It was the worst possible outcome, the conclusion she dreaded most. Even the final line she believed she could defend had now been breached.

 

Why was it born?

 

Why hadn’t it been extinguished?

 

Why hadn’t it drawn its last breath in the womb?

 

It was predictable. Because even that was a part of Altahart. A stubborn, loathsome pit of toxic humanity. The very root of evil, nurtured by their tainted blood. Despite all her effort to tear it away, it had clung tenaciously to her womb…

 

“Congratulations. It’s a boy.”

 

So disgusting…

 

“Judging by the cry, he seems very healthy.”

 

So horrifying…

 

“May he grow to be as fine a young master as his father.”

 

A monster…

 

Lisbell stared blankly at the nurse’s arms. The being held there was a tiny, fragile lifeform. So small and delicate, it was a wonder how it was even breathing.

 

Disgusting and horrifying—yet utterly unlike the monstrous image she had always imagined.

 

The newborn, with traces of amniotic fluid still dampening its skin, was swaddled in a white blanket. Its minuscule mouth puckered like a baby bird’s beak, as if on the verge of crying. It curled its fingers the size of an adult’s fingertip, wiggling its tightly tucked legs. Every tiny movement absorbed into her gaze felt unreal, impossibly delicate.

 

The nurse turned slightly to show the baby to Ulrich. Unlike Lisbell, his expression went beyond calm to utterly dry. His gaze resembled that of someone evaluating a tool to be used out of necessity.

 

Then, straightening from his leaning position toward the bed, he approached the nurse.

 

Huh…?

 

The next moment, Lisbell doubted her eyes. It was because of what Ulrich did. He traced a cross over the baby’s body, stopping around its abdomen.

 

The sign of the cross.

 

To him, it had always been a religious gesture of blessing and fortitude to overcome trials—but only when done to himself.

 

Done to another person, it bore a completely different meaning. And Lisbell knew exactly what that meant.

 

A ritual most often seen… at funerals. The sign of the cross performed on someone else signified mourning.

 

“Is everything ready for Portley Church?”

 

Ulrich spoke as he drew his hand away from the baby.

 

Lisbell’s grip on the bedsheet tightened. Her pale, bloodless fingertips reflected the state of her heart perfectly.

 

“…Young Master?”

 

The uncertain voice came from Victor, who had been waiting at the side. As someone close to Ulrich, he clearly hadn’t been informed, and the confusion on his face only broke Lisbell further.

 

“Take the baby first.”

 

Unfazed by the reactions around him, Ulrich simply issued the command.

 

Just moments ago, Lisbell hadn’t even had the strength to sit up—but now she was slightly propped up with trembling arms, the tension in the room unmistakable. She didn’t know why, but a scene from a dream flashed through her mind. A crow clawing through her swollen belly with its sharp beak… The dread it brought was suffocating.

 

“Portley Church… why…?”

 

Lisbell already knew the place. Her mother was buried there. Just hearing the name was enough to fill her nose with the stench of death.

 

As if sensing her fear, the baby—held in the nurse’s arms and being taken out of the room—let out a piercing wail. It was as if it desperately wanted someone to know it was here.

 

That overwhelming vitality terrified Lisbell. She thought she had already burned to ash, but the fire rekindled, peeling flesh from her bones. Her face turned even more ashen. She sat on the edge of the bed, staring at the man’s arrogant smile with growing horror.

 

Ulrich reached out and brushed away strands of hair stuck to her sweaty face.

 

“Such a pitiful soul.”

 



 

“There’s family buried there. It won’t rot alone.”

 

As soon as he said that, Victor’s face hardened. He gritted his teeth and abruptly left the room. Not long after, the baby’s crying stopped. The silence that followed pressed in on Lisbell as if trying to crush her.

 

Just moments ago, that being had been here. The one she had guarded against and despised. The one she had thought of as a stubborn, monstrous parasite—yet when the mask came off, it had seemed anything but monstrous. It had been so small, so inherently in need of care.

 

But now, perhaps it was gone.

 

To be precise—

 

Despite his gentle smile, Ulrich’s eyes were chilling. As if digging into her very organs. Lisbell couldn’t look away.

 

Her lips parted. Ulrich gently grasped her chin and lifted it as he said smoothly,

 

“Why that face?”

 



 

“This is what you wanted, isn’t it?”

 

What?

 

Why…?

 

How could this be what she wanted?

 

“You said so… You said you wanted me to do something, anything.”

 

“You told me to take care of it.”

 

A shiver ran through her body.

 

“Why don’t you trust me?”

 

No. It can’t be.

 

“Lisbell, how many times do I have to say the same thing?”

 

“I told you—leave it to me.”

 

No… It couldn’t be that method…

 

“How…”

 

“However it takes.”

 

That confident method of his… Was this it?

 

Was this how he meant to handle it?

 

“Whether I get rid of it inside the womb, or after it comes out…”

 

He murmured it like a final, chilling blow.

 

Suddenly, her entire body felt clammy. Lisbell’s distant gaze dropped to her lower body. Only then did she truly grasp the state she was in.

 

Due to the childbirth, the sheets were stained with a large amount of blood and cold sweat dried in patches, leaving behind wrinkled creases. Her stomach remained excessively swollen despite the emptiness left behind from what had once filled it. These were all irrefutable realities that most directly proved the fact that she had given birth.

 

An event had occurred that could never be undone.

 

“No…”

 

And that’s why—no.

 

“Th-this is…”

 

This truly wasn’t it. No human should ever commit such an act. Even imagining it was horrifying—something no sane mind could endure. Even if that cruel man could do it, she—at least she—couldn’t.

 

“No…”

 

The end of her heart felt like it was burning in agony.

 

She had thought the pain earlier would kill her, but it turned out she was still alive. Now—this moment—felt far closer to death. Because now, she had no choice but to say the words herself.

 

“Don’t do this… please…”

 



 

“Please! Please…! Please, please…”

 

It only made clearer the fact that she would always have to raise the white flag in front of this man.

 

Why wasn’t she hearing any crying? Why had it suddenly cut off so abruptly? Just imagining the answers brought tears streaming hotly from her eyes.

 

She wanted to follow Victor and run out right this second, but having just given birth, even taking a single step was impossible. So all she could do to stop him was—

 

“I-I was wrong.”

 

—beg miserably.

 

“It was all my fault. I-I said something… I couldn’t be responsible for… I-I’m sorry, I’m so sorry. It’s all my fault. I was just overthinking, I was afraid… so please… please…”

 

That child, the seed of Altahart, had to die. Now.

 

But why?

 

What wrong had the baby done?

 

She couldn’t sever that looping thought no matter how hard she tried.

 

When she saw the life wrapped in the swaddle, she’d been stunned. What had she been so afraid of all this time? She even felt a strange sense of futility. But that thought awoke what should never have been awakened. That tender feeling swallowed the monstrous sense of duty that had once driven her to want to end that life—and now, it made the whole situation unbearably painful.

 

In the end.

 

Again.

 

Lisbell’s lips parted as she clutched her head with both hands, like she was going to vomit.

 

“Aaaaaah…!”

 

What poured out was a wretched scream.

 

It was herself—her own reflection before this cruel, unavoidable reality—that made her scream.

 

“Aaaaaah!”

 

Losing everything and gaining nothing. This cycle doomed to repeat until she withered away. Lisbell realized she could never escape it. The only way to survive now seemed to be smashing her own head.

 

“Ah! Ah! Aaaah!”

 

Her ash-grey hair flew through the air as she slammed her forehead against whatever she could. The despair was even deeper because she knew even this violent flailing would be useless in the end.

 

Maybe—just maybe—it would be better to die.

 

Yes, if only she had died sooner, she wouldn’t be suffering like this.

 

Lisbell, crawling and fumbling, rolled off the bed. From below, where nothing had yet been cleaned, blood had flowed out, leaving cruel traces along the path.

 

Thud. Just as her body was about to fall, something caught her, like cradling her. The strength of the grip filled her with revulsion. It was a vice-like hell from which she couldn’t escape once caught.

 

As soon as she realized that, Lisbell tried with all her might to bite down on her tongue. It was her only remaining option. There was no gun, and the window was too far away to throw herself from—so this was the only way left.

 

She braced herself to bite it clean off this time, to make up for her previous failed attempt where she had only ended up foaming blood. But what her teeth closed around wasn’t the familiar soft flesh of her tongue—it was something long and hard.

 

No. That’s not…

 

Something was wrong. Very wrong. She bit down harder, but the result was the same. The metallic taste of blood filled her mouth, but there was no pain.

 

Only then did Lisbell realize what it was: a man’s fingers, invading her mouth, were what she had been trying to chew through.

 

Ah… even her final act…

 

As her consciousness dulled, something pricked her arm. A tranquilizer spread through her veins, and Lisbell’s body slackened and finally stilled.

 

Ulrich, who slowly withdrew his finger from her slightly parted lips, gently brushed back her sweat-drenched bangs and whispered:

 

“This is why I can’t let you go. Truly, my dear…”

 

My conscience.

 

With that soft whisper, Ulrich placed a kiss on Lisbell’s forehead and laid her limp body on the bed, instructing the medical staff to treat her. The doctors and nurses rushed to the bedside.

 

As they examined her and stitched the torn wound, Ulrich loosened his tie. His finger—covered in bite marks, saliva, and blood—was a mess. He wiped it off carefully with a black cloth and pressed his lips to it, quietly smiling.

 

A moment later, as if all his earlier tenderness had been a lie, Ulrich casually tossed the tie aside and walked out the door.

 

Victor, who had taken the baby from the nurse, looked half in shock. The nurse, standing before him, explained with hand gestures that she had merely followed the young master’s instructions to sedate the baby for a thorough examination.

 

Ulrich pushed between them and took the baby into his own arms. As Victor, finally regaining his senses, hurried after him, Ulrich informed him while walking down the carpeted hallway:

 

“Inform the family.”

 

“…Sorry?”

 

Victor blinked in confusion. Ulrich, who had been walking ahead, suddenly stopped.

 

He slowly turned around—but didn’t meet Victor’s gaze. Instead, he looked down lovingly at the peacefully sleeping newborn in his arms.

 

“My one and only…”

 

Gone was the cold stare from earlier, replaced by a face full of warmth and affection.

 

“…heir has been born.”

 

Chills ran down every part of Victor’s body. Just as his eyes met Ulrich’s raised gaze, he finally understood the source of that dreadful sensation.

 

Perhaps this man… from the very beginning…

 

A gut feeling surged—so twisted and terrifying he dared not speak it aloud.

 

Before Victor’s stunned thoughts could fully coalesce, Ulrich turned and walked away again. Through the skylight above the hallway he was passing, the world outside came into view.

 

Under the high, blue sky, small snowflakes were falling ever so quietly.

 

The first snow of the year.

 

A pure, clear thing—plunging straight into the abyss.
