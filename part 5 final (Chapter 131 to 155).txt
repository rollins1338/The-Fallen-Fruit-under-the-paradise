Chapter 131


“Thank you for saying that. Oh no, my handkerchief…”

Trying to hide his emotions or perhaps out of embarrassment, he rubbed his lips awkwardly, only to notice the damp state of his handkerchief and let out a sigh.

Lisbell responded with a gentle smile, signaling that it was alright.

“You don’t have to return the handkerchief. I’ll take my leave now.”

“Wait, Bell.”

“Yes?”

“Would it be possible for us to meet again later… in the confessional?”

Lisbell blinked, startled.

Could just a few words have been that much of a comfort? At the same time, it dawned on her that Sir Philip must be going through such a hard time with no one to rely on. She hesitated before speaking.

“Well, since I haven’t taken my perpetual vows yet… I’m afraid I can’t oversee a confession.”

“It’s fine. You don’t need to offer prayers or blessings. Just listening is more than enough.”

“That’s….”

“If you don’t want to, I understand.”

“…I’ll ask the priest about it.”

Though she said this, it would likely be approved. Wasn’t Sir Philip considered an esteemed guest of the monastery? Even if it wasn’t for a formal confession, they’d surely allow her to simply lend an ear.

Perhaps sensing this as well, Sir Philip’s expression brightened. Was this really okay? She felt a brief pang of concern, but seeing his face, her doubts quickly dissipated. Lisbell couldn’t quite discern whether this willing heart was truly for Sir Philip’s sake or if it was to comfort her own, scarred past.



“…Could you hang this?”



“Bell.”



“Bell!”

Startled, Lisbell snapped out of her thoughts and turned to her side.

“Huh?”

“This, could you hang this up?”

“Oh, right.”

Lisbell took the laundry Delilah handed her, spread it out carefully, and hung it on the line. She smoothed out the fabric with her palm to avoid creases, gave it two quick shakes, and clipped it to the edge with a peg. The fabric fluttered in the wind that blew past.

Her gaze drifted unconsciously down to the cliffs below, where the wind originated. It was almost a reflex. A quiet chuckle came from beside her.

“Bell, you’re quite the thinker, aren’t you?”

“Huh?”

“Always going to the chapel whenever you have time, or getting lost in thought like this. You seem to ponder a lot.”

Delilah said, humming a tune as she pulled another piece of laundry from the basket.

Lisbell felt slightly awkward, wondering if that’s how others saw her. She couldn’t outright deny it—after all, she often caught herself, almost habitually, gazing at the scenic view beyond.

Of course, there was a reason why she often found herself in such a state.

‘…Too.’

Quiet.

Calm and serene, to the point where even the flow of air could be felt at her fingertips—peaceful, even.

For Lisbell, however, this overwhelming tranquility carried with it an odd sense of unease.

What kind of resolve had she embraced when she chose this place as her new haven? She had prepared herself for the oppressive presence of a man as tempestuous as a violent gale. What would she do if that happened? Would she have to leave? If so, where would she go next? Was there any place better than here? Her thoughts collided, fractured, and split apart, day by day.

But contrary to her worries, ever since joining the monastery, her days had been unthinkably tranquil. Lisbell bit hard on the inside of her cheek. A sharp sting spread. Could this all be a dream? Her body, still haunted by memories of a hellish past, occasionally resorted to such self-destructive actions to confirm reality.

She had longed for such a life, but now that she had it, she felt only anxiety. It was as though she alone was aware of an impending catastrophe, waiting in dread.

‘…Come to think of it, that day was strange, too.’

The day when, despite reaching the storeroom of the tavern, he had suddenly ordered a retreat—this recent memory began to nag at her.

It wasn’t a bad sign.

The abrupt withdrawal then and the unbroken tranquility of her current life seemed to point to a hopeful possibility.

‘Has he… grown tired of me?’

Could it be that the moment had finally come?

Yes, Ulrich was bound to wake up eventually.

She was someone he had no reason to oppress, bind, or obsess over. She had nothing to offer—neither family, personal gain, nor any political or economic advantage.

Perhaps, in the course of searching for her, he had come to this immutable realization. Facing the futility of his actions might have brought a storm of disillusionment upon him, and if so, yes, it was entirely possible he would give up.

Yet, when confronted with the possibility that it might really be over, she found herself bewildered.

Really?

Was this truly how it ended between them?

Was it true that the tiresome thread tying them together had finally frayed?

“…The weather’s nice,” Lisbell muttered suddenly.

“Hm?”

“I said, the weather’s nice.”

“Oh, yeah, it is. Then again, isn’t it rare for the weather to be bad here?”

Lisbell, matching Delilah’s cheerful laugh, reached into the basket and pulled out another piece of laundry. She was still mulling over the oddly liberating thought—like a bad tooth finally pulled—when Delilah struck up a conversation.

“Did you hear? The funds for the new cathedral they were planning to build in the capital have finally been raised. Apparently, Sir Philip made an enormous donation.”

“Really?”

Lisbell responded nonchalantly, holding the now-empty basket, but Delilah nudged her lightly in the chest with her elbow.

“Didn’t he say anything to you?”

“Say anything? About what?”

“Well, you’ve built some rapport with Sir Philip, haven’t you? I thought maybe you’d mentioned something that inspired him.”

“I… I didn’t do anything. I just listened to him.”

Lisbell’s homeland wasn’t here, and as a newcomer to the monastery, she wasn’t devout enough to claim deep faith. Though she occasionally lent an ear to Sir Philip’s confessions, she insisted that her actions carried no hidden intent.

“If he cherishes you that much, maybe you should try asking him for a personal donation.”

“What? That’s absurd. How could I take advantage of a man desperate over his daughter?”

“Oh, come on, I was kidding!”

Delilah, startled by Lisbell’s rare serious tone, quickly laughed and slung an arm over her shoulder.

“Still, this is something Darian should hear and praise you for. Even if you say you just listened, who knows? That might have meant the world to Sir Philip.”

“Maybe…”

“You’re heading to the confessional tonight, right?”

When Lisbell nodded, Delilah patted her on the shoulder, saying she worked hard.

After finishing the laundry, Lisbell had a bit of personal time back in her quarters. As the sky shifted from crimson to gold and finally to a dusky gray, she reflected.

Later, with her Bible tucked under her arm, she made her way to the chapel after dinner.

As expected, her request to oversee the confessional had been approved. It was an exceptional decision—normally, only priests or those of higher rank could occupy the confessional.

This spoke volumes about Sir Philip’s status within the monastery. It was evident they didn’t want to offend him.

As she’d told Delilah, it wasn’t a difficult task. Lisbell simply had to sit quietly and listen to the voice that came through the small confessional window. She wouldn’t offer absolution or lead prayers—her role was merely to be present.

Through the translucent glass, she caught a glimpse of gray hair sticking out from beneath her veil. Since cutting her hair short, she sometimes struggled to keep it neatly tucked away.

As she adjusted the stray strands, she felt a presence on the other side of the confessional.

Lisbell lowered her hand from her veil and quietly opened the confessional window.

The air that wafted in felt oddly cold—despite the fact that spring had already arrived.


“Bell. Are you there?”

Lisbell’s fingertips curled involuntarily.

The beginning was different from usual. From the sound of his voice, the person in the confessional was clearly Philip. When the confessional window was left open, he would not usually address her directly; instead, he would spill out long-winded complaints as if trying to release the burdens weighing on him.

“Are you there?”

“…Yes, Philip.”

She didn’t know why he was confirming her presence, but since she didn’t think it was an important matter, she answered willingly.

Philip seemed to have relaxed upon hearing her response and returned to his usual demeanor before speaking.

They had met like this about five times so far.

Through these encounters, Lisbell had gathered some vague information about his daughter.

Her name was Sawyer Vinchest, and she was only eight years old. Lisbell couldn’t help but wonder how one could be so devoted at such a young age. She was at an age where the days ahead were far more numerous than the days already lived.

Sawyer’s illness was a rare disease that even doctors had never encountered. It was so rare that it required the advanced medical knowledge of more developed countries, and there was so little information about it that relying on religion seemed to be the only way to hope for divine intervention.

“Bell. I have a request today.”

Philip suddenly said this, after previously opening up about his time spent with his daughter.

Lisbell, who had been listening quietly, widened her eyes in surprise.

“A request? What kind of…?”

“Would it be possible for you to pray for me, even if it’s briefly?”

She briefly recalled Delilah’s words, thinking that this moment might have been deeply moving for him.

Lisbell hesitated but then opened the confessional window a little more.

Given his recent donation to the cathedral’s funds, it was clear that he was someone deserving of utmost courtesy. To upset him would result in undesirable consequences for the monastery, and that could, in turn, have a negative impact on Lisbell as well.

It wasn’t actually such a difficult request.

If they weren’t in the confessional, it would be something Lisbell could do freely. She had often seen Sonya or Delilah earnestly fulfilling requests to pray for others who came seeking guidance.

“I understand,” she said briefly, and just as she spoke, a hand slid over the open confessional window.

Lisbell gazed at the hand, squinting. Was he asking her to hold it? She wasn’t sure if it was necessary, but she thought that if it could bring comfort to someone in distress, there was no reason not to do it. So, she reached out her own hand.

“…!”

Immediately, a powerful grip enveloped the back of her hand.

It wasn’t a cautious or careful grip; it was a near-snatch, almost like a sudden pull. It felt like being swept away by a strong wave, and for a moment, she couldn’t breathe.

Now that she focused, something felt off.

She had never truly seen Philip’s hand properly, but the one holding hers was far too pale and delicate for his. Compared to his thin body, the fingers were firm, the joints thick, and the shape was strikingly graceful, almost sculptural. If she were to describe it, she would say it was so exquisitely formed that it seemed out of place on Philip’s body.

Lisbell couldn’t help but think of a stranger as she looked at the hand.

A chill ran down her spine, and she shuddered.

As soon as their hands touched, his grip tightened like a vice. The rigid fingers dug into her, almost as if to forcefully separate her own. The joints of her hand seemed to scream silently as they were forced apart against her will.

Being physically caught only made the discomfort sharper. There was an unfamiliar feeling rising inside her, one she couldn’t shake.

This hand… where had she felt it before?

Her thoughts cleared, and a tingle spread down her neck. This sculpted hand had most likely been on her body before. Pressing against her neck, gripping tightly around her delicate throat, tightening the air passages cruelly.

“Wait…!”

Lisbell tried to pull her hand free from his tangled grip, but no matter how much she struggled or shook, she couldn’t escape.

“Let… let go… please, let go!”

The frantic movements of her body grew more intense as she suddenly stood, causing the chair to topple backward with a loud crash that echoed in the small space.

A wave of unstable vibration spread from deep within her chest. The terror of a deadly poison spread throughout her, consuming her sense of self. It felt as though she were about to die from touching some kind of disease. Lisbell swung her arm wildly in a frenzy, but the strength of the grip made it impossible to break free. Her arm felt like it might be pulled out of its socket instead.

“…Ugh…!”

It all happened in an instant.

The hand that had seemed intent on dragging her into a hellish abyss released her without hesitation. The sudden change in force made Lisbell stumble backward, landing hard on the ground. Her tailbone ached sharply from the impact, but there was no time to focus on the pain.

The door opened. The door to the confessional remained tightly closed, but the person on the other side had stepped out.

The sound of footsteps grew louder, and Lisbell, pale and trembling, slowly pressed herself into the corner, as if she wanted to escape even from the small space. When she realized there was no longer anywhere to run, she scratched the wooden floor so hard that her nails nearly tore.

Knock. Knock.

The sound of the knock echoed through the small space.

Lisbell, feeling as though she would hyperventilate at any moment, clutched her chest. It seemed like she shouldn’t even make a sound, not even a breath the size of an ant’s nail. She consciously suppressed her breathing, hoping that no one would notice she was here.

But, as always, the situation did not go as she wished.

As if the knock had sufficiently signaled the intrusion, the door opened without hesitation. Her trembling eyes couldn’t contain their fear and fell toward the floor, where shadows, like muddy water, pooled at her feet.

“Bell?”

The voice that came next drained the strength from her body.

The sudden relief that rushed toward her felt like a sharp jolt as Philip’s face appeared. The hand that had been clutching his chest so tightly that the wrinkles on his clothes were crinkling slowly dropped.

Lisbell, sitting there as if she had lost all strength, snapped back to reality at the sight of Philip’s face, which was full of concern for her.

Unfortunately, the shallow doubt that had already crept in couldn’t be dismissed so easily.

She hastily ran out of the confessional and threw open the door to the small room where Philip had been just moments ago. The space looked the same, as though everything had been reversed, but there was no one there.

It was empty.

Only then did a deep sense of relief settle deep within her. Yet, the aftermath of the malicious emotions seemed to root deep inside, and an anxious, racing heartbeat continued without stopping.

A sudden dizziness struck. With fear dissipating, panic filled the void, and it repeatedly nudged at her consciousness.

“Sir, I… I’m sorry, but I’m not feeling well today…”

She couldn’t even finish her sentence properly. However, just seeing her pale complexion, Philip could already tell that she was in no condition to continue, and he nodded with a look of concern.

She had no idea how she managed to return to her quarters.

‘Ah, the Bible…’

It wasn’t until she had arrived at her quarters that she realized she had dropped the scripture she had taken with her, like a lost item. There had been no time or mental space to focus on it. If she had, she would have dared to ask Philip, despite the impropriety, if he could just show her his hand once.

‘Was my mind… too far gone?’

Lisbell slumped onto the bed, unable to calm herself, muttering quietly.

The one who had been beside her was indeed Philip, and there was no one in the space he had just left.

If it were simply a misunderstanding, then it could be easily concluded. But that wasn’t so simple.

If it was indeed a misunderstanding, how far did that misunderstanding stretch?

What about the hand that had been wrongfully seen?

That overwhelming strength that had pulled her in—was that part of the confusion and misunderstanding as well?

But that sensation had clearly existed.

The cold, invasive touch that dug into her joints and the feeling of being bound, as though she had been struck by a whip and left immobilized. The strength that had pulled her, pushing the eerie feeling of déjà vu to the forefront, was something she couldn’t mistake. Her instincts screamed that it was unmistakable.

“…Ha.”

A dry, hollow laugh escaped her lips, wilting in the air like a dead flower.

What was this?

Was she losing her mind?

Could Ulrich have already found her and infiltrated this place? She denied it, though, as she had confirmed his absence with her own eyes. But the anxiety and unease she couldn’t shake were driving her into a state of near madness.

Or perhaps, it was nothing.

But if it was, what would she do?

What if he had already found her and was planning something sinister?


Should I run away from here right now?

 

But where to?

 

And until when?

 

It hadn’t even been half a day since she was happy thinking that his fickleness might have caused him to lose interest in her. The fact that her mood could turn as wretched as flipping a palm because of that man’s presence was undeniably unpleasant and unsettling. It felt like evidence that she could never escape from him in the future…

 

‘…again.’

 

She couldn’t breathe.

 

Lisbell, like someone who curses in silence, opened her mouth and rubbed her nape vigorously. The feeling of the shackles that had been fastened here at that time surged up, piercing through her current consciousness.

 

She tried to keep her nails down somehow, but by the time she came to her senses, she had already scratched herself enough to break the skin.

 

The sound of scratching reached Lisbell’s ears, but it felt quite distant. The delicate skin, unblemished by anything, was exposed to the nails, leaving long, stinging scratches.

 

Her body, which had slumped forward as if being dragged, fell over. She buried her forehead into the sheet and rubbed it back and forth, scratching her neck frantically. She knew her flesh was torn and the red blood was pooling inside her round nails, but her senses seemed to be malfunctioning and wouldn’t respond.

 

At least for now, the fear left by the sinister touch was pulsing more vividly than her stern command to pull herself together.

 

“Ugh… mm.”

 

For a moment, it felt like she had caught a chill, and her whole body became cold. The outside weather, which Lisbell thought had become warmer and that spring had finally arrived, felt unbelievably cold, penetrating deep into my bones.

 

Later on, it scratched her arms and legs as if it were contagious. The filthy sensations of the past, when the man’s large and beautiful hands would grip her wrists or press down painfully to spread my calves or thighs, were all awakening. Her throat felt constricted.

 

Why?

 

Why isn’t it coming off even though I’m scratching it?

 

Why does it still feel like it’s clinging to my body…?

 

The clothing that wrapped around her arms and legs became a mess. Even the veil that barely covered her hair slipped down gradually, coming undone with her spasmodic movements.

 

In an instant, Lisbell, who had become a ragged mess, suddenly stopped all her actions, gasping for breath as if she had been stabbed in the lungs.

 

After a while, the exhausted sheep collapsed in front of Lisbell.

 

Throbbing filled her senses.

 

It felt like an invisible blunt object was striking the back of her head, causing a sharp pain. She raised her hand with eyes drained of all strength. Lisbellt was the same side that had been caught in the confessional a moment ago. It felt as if an invisible bug was wriggling and crawling on it.

 

When Lisbell regained her composure for just a moment and saw that even her other hand was scratching with the opposite hand, a laugh that sounded almost deranged escaped her lips.

 

She let her arm drop, which had been held up to my eyes. The bloodstains smeared at the tips of her fingers drew a messy doodle on the white sheet. Even knowing the sheet would get dirty, one part of her mind was hazy. The faint smell of blood tormented her nostrils.

 

Slowly turning onto her side, Lisbell curled up her body. She kept gathering herself until her chest and knees almost touched.

 

With bloodshot eyes, Lisbell stared to the side and then tightly closed them.

 

Thud, thud, thud.

 

This was truly a fear without substance.

 

A fight that made her wonder if it will ever truly end.

 

It was as if she had already become a pitiful defeated soldier, helplessly being swept away, submerged, and devoured.

 

She closed her eyes not realizing when she fell asleep.

 

It might have been that she had become so worn out, that she finally fainted. When Lisbell opened her eyes again, she heard the chirping of sparrows outside the window, which was open just a crack.

 

Without even thinking of brushing aside the messy hair, Lisbell hesitantly sat up.

 

Only then did she see the clothes that had been torn off like peeling skin and her limbs that had been mutilated with ugly wounds. She couldn’t check immediately because there was no mirror, but her neck would probably be the same. It might even be worse. It was obvious that her anxiety would only deepen, so she didn’t bother to check.

 

Next, what caught Lisbell’s eye was the blanket she had spread out and slept on all night.

 

Pieces of flesh had clumped inside her nails, and the droplets of blood that had splattered down left faint traces everywhere. It wasn’t a gushing amount, but the white color of the blanket made it stand out.

 

She had to lift her aching body, which felt like it had been chewed up and spat out by a beast. A groan escaped her lips involuntarily.

 

First, she headed to the communal bathroom and washed her body clean with hot water. The wounds left from last night’s struggle stung in various places, but she only occasionally frowned, not letting out a single groan.

 

She woke up quite early in the morning, and no one came in and out of the bathroom while she was washing up. Nevertheless, not wanting to run into anyone, she hurried back to her room without properly drying her wet body.

 

As she rubbed her hair, which had become even fluffier with moisture, with a towel, Lisbell discovered the blanket with bloodstains still visible.

 

“…sigh.”

 

The traces that fully prove yesterday’s chaos poked at a corner of her heart.

 

The laundry from the accommodation was all collected by the person in charge of laundry around 10 AM, neatly washed, and then hung out to dry on the hillside behind the corridor and the cliff around noon when the sunlight was best.

 

As always, but today Lisbell couldn’t leave it to anyone else because of the bloodstains. If today’s person on duty found the stains while folding the blankets, they might ask if something happened last night or if she got hurt somewhere. This place was sometimes a problem because it overflowed with too much love and recognition.

 

Since she woke up early, there was still time before the official workday began. Lisbell rolled up her blanket and left the small room.

 

Even though spring had arrived, the morning air still felt a bit chilly. Lisbell tightly closed her mouth and headed to the laundry area, putting the blanket into a large tub. She pressed the wet blanket down with her bare feet. For the areas where there were still traces of blood, she scrubbed them with her hands to completely remove the stains.

 

It was time to wash the blankets with such dedication and sincerity.

 

“Bell? Is that you, Bell? What are you doing over there?”

 

The sound of splashing water stopped.

 

She lifted her head slightly and saw Sonya standing there. She wasn’t dressed in her usual attire for the monastery. Judging by the direction she was coming from, it seemed she had gone out after seeking permission from the higher-ups and had just returned at this hour.

 

“I was washing the blanket.”

 

“The blanket? This morning?”

 

“Yes. I spilled some tea.”

 

Sonya squinted one eye as if to say, “Why did you make such a bothersome mistake?”

 

“Sonya, what about you? Are you on your way back from going out?”

 

“Yes. I originally had some plans later, but I got a sudden request, so I came back a bit early.”

 

“Request?”

 

“It seems like an urgent message from the Vinchest family.”

 

Lisbell’s hands, which had been doing the laundry, suddenly stopped.

 

“…Vinchest? Are you talking about Lord Philip’s family?”

 

“That’s right.”

 

“If it’s urgent news coming from their side…”

 

Sonya, too, seemed to have an inkling and let out a deep sigh.

 

“It must be about his daughter.”

 

As expected.

 

Sonya checked the tower clock in the courtyard and waved her arms around.

 

“I really want to help you, but it’s more urgent to deliver this to the priest. I’ll go ahead, Bell. See you later!”

 

Lisbell looked at Sonya’s retreating figure and then glanced down at the tub filled with blankets. The water, which had consumed half of her hand, rippled.

 

Was his daughter’s condition getting worse again?

 

When?

 

Around last night?

 

When she saw him in the confessional, there was no sign of anything unusual about Lord Philip. But wasn’t illness like a sudden event that can overturn a peaceful situation at any time? If the situation changed so abruptly, it made sense that the urgent message to the monastery arrived so quickly.

 

It was around the afternoon when she was able to get a bit more accurate information about it.

 

Suddenly, everyone was called to the special room. Those gathered seemed to know the reason for the day’s tense atmosphere and were busy gossiping.

 

“Why the sudden call?”

 

“It must be because of Lord Philip’s matter.”

 

“Did you say an urgent report arrived this morning?”

 

“Has his daughter’s condition worsened significantly?”

 

“That may be so, but why call us? We’re just apprentice priests.”

 

“Could it be that the funeral has already been held…?”

 

“Shh! Watch your mouth. What if someone important hears you?”

 

“Yes. Just keep those thoughts to yourself.”

 

“It’s not such a grand issue, but… these days, it’s obvious that the higher-ups are paying special attention to Philip.”

 

“Is it because of that? The Temple Fund of the Monastery.”

 

“Or what? If we happen to offend Lord Philip and he asks for the donation to be returned, it would be troublesome in many ways, wouldn’t it?”

 

The whispers and gossip, each with their own story, never ceased. But soon, the closed door opened, and Darian and the priest appeared.


“Is everyone here?”

Darian, standing before the gathered people, spoke in a grave voice.

Lisbell hadn’t particularly felt it during their first meeting or while overseeing her mother’s funeral, but Darian possessed the inherent dignity of someone in charge. Even now, it was unmistakable. As if to prove it, everyone fell silent, closing their mouths and turning their attention to Darian.

Darian made eye contact with each of them one by one, then briefly glanced at the priest behind her before getting to the point.

“I apologize for calling you all together while you’re each fulfilling your duties. This morning, we received urgent news from the Vinchest family. Those of you who are already aware, know that Lord Philip, a cherished brother of our monastery, has a daughter who has been suffering from a chronic illness since childhood. Although she has somehow managed to survive until now, it seems she had a severe seizure last night.”

The atmosphere in the room grew cold as if a mouse had died. Even though some had vaguely anticipated the bad news, hearing it confirmed from an official source felt quite different. Lisbell fell silent, quietly clasping her hands.

Seeing the somber atmosphere, Darian nodded slowly, as if trying to offer some comfort.

“Although the doctor was urgently called, the prognosis is not good. Lord Philip has requested that we send a few of our priests and nuns to his estate to be by his daughter’s side. He wishes for them to pray earnestly for her.”

“Darian, I have a question.”

Someone from the back row raised their hand.

“Yes?”

“Exactly what should those chosen to go to Lord Philip’s estate be doing?”

It seemed that others had the same question, as they all waited silently, watching Darian. After a moment, she moved her lips slightly and elaborated.

“According to the doctor’s additional opinion, the next few nights will be critical. If she can survive this, she may recover for a while, but it will be a difficult time. Lord Philip hopes that the monastery’s esteemed members will visit his estate and pray with all their hearts for the Miss.”

It sounded simple, but it wasn’t quite so.

What if one of those chose to stay the night, only to have the girl succumb to her illness, her breath finally stopping?

Lord Philip wasn’t just a devout believer; he also played a pivotal role in the country’s major social projects, acting as a financial pillar for the construction of the temple. His daughter’s death would certainly cause a great deal of uncomfortable repercussions. That tension seemed to hang in the air, and Darian also seemed to have anticipated that no one would volunteer willingly.

She clarified that the decision on who would go would be made by the higher-ups, and quickly moved on to wrap up the meeting.

Then Darian suddenly spoke.

“Bell. I’d like you to stay behind for a moment.”

Unexpectedly called out, Lisbell nodded toward those leaving the guest room and stayed behind.

Once the door was closed, Darian approached her.

“How have you been adjusting to life here?”

“It’s still difficult in many ways, but… I’m trying my best to adapt.”

It seemed like the right answer, as Darian gave her a gentle smile.

“For someone saying that, it seems you’ve been doing quite well.”

“Really?”

“Lord Philip specifically requested for you to come to his estate.”

Her response didn’t provoke laughter. Instead, Darian was expressing satisfaction that Lisbell had performed her duties as a nun admirably. She had been worried when Lisbell was admitted into the order on her recommendation, but now, seeing how well she was doing, Darian appeared somewhat proud.

Lisbell, on the other hand, felt confused.

Not only had they met in the confessional, but now this? Was she truly a source of great comfort to him?

She couldn’t completely disregard what had happened the night before either.

The hand that grabbed her. The force pulling her. The dizziness as her nape was caressed. Even just briefly recalling it sent a sense of unease that had yet to be fully processed, clutching at her heart once more.

“Is… is it really a place where I am needed?”

Lisbell struggled to speak.

“I think it might be better for someone with more experience to go, for Lord Philip’s sake.”

“Even if Lord Philip specifically wants you to go?”

“I’m grateful for his reliance, but… I’m also afraid I won’t be able to repay him properly.”

Darian seemed to be lost in thought for a moment, but then, as if she understood Lisbell’s feelings, she nodded.

“That’s right. Even though you’ve been chosen, we can’t disregard your own wishes.”



“I’ll explain the situation to them, so don’t worry too much.”

Darian whispered with a gentle tone and a warm smile, indicating that Lisbell could leave.

As Lisbell stepped out into the hallway and began thinking about her next task, she suddenly recalled the Bible she had left behind in the confessional yesterday. Since she had some free time, she decided to go retrieve it.

However, she couldn’t shake off the lingering unease in her heart.

Despite being specifically chosen and relied upon, was it really the right thing to go and comfort someone whose daughter might die tomorrow?

One… the panic from yesterday wasn’t something she could easily move past.

The fragmented memories still left her in a haze. The fear was so strong that it prevented her from even wanting to revisit it. The protective instinct of a father toward his ailing daughter was touching and pitiable, but Lisbell didn’t have the mental capacity to focus on that alone.

Yes, it was the right thing to do.

Who was I to worry about anyone else, or think about comforting them in my situation?

Finally, after sorting through her wavering thoughts, she arrived at the confessional. Upon confirming that no one was inside, Lisbell cautiously opened the wooden door.

As she remembered, her struggles had caused the chair to topple, and the Bible placed on the stand had flown to the corner of the floor.

She expected it to be left in that state, but to her surprise, the Bible was neatly placed back on the stand as if nothing had happened. A small piece of paper was resting on top of it. Lisbell entered the small space and picked it up.

“I apologize if I startled you.”

Written briefly, with “P.Vin” marked at the edges. From the notation, it was clear who had left it.

Philip Vinchest.

Lisbell stood frozen, clutching the small piece of paper.

It was like a stone she had consciously ignored, now swelling into a massive snowball, settling heavily in her stomach.

It was impossible to overlook his genuine compassion, which she had tried to dismiss for simply feeling uneasy. The feeling that reminded her of her own past, when no one cared about her, tugged at her heart.

With the paper tightly gripped in her hand, Lisbell turned and hurriedly ran back to the guest room, where she had just spoken with Darian.

The question that had been haunting her was clear.

Could she live with not regretting her decision?

If, in the days she had ignored it, Philip Vintchest’s daughter, Soyer, were to die—if she failed to provide even spiritual support, if Lord Philip were to be hurt by her neglect, could she bear that without regret?

No, she would never forget it.

Just like she could never let go of her mother before she was buried in this monastery.

Turning away from someone who needed help and causing them pain would ultimately return that pain to herself. From the moment they met, it felt like she was facing a reflection of herself, and that connection made it impossible for her to turn away.

Some might think it was outdated, or perhaps a naive, angelic thought. But this was who she was.

Raised in the warmth of her mother’s nurturing arms, she learned that generosity and care were virtues of an intellectual being. She had grown up understanding that this was natural and right. She wanted to live by this ethical belief and never forget it.

“Darian.”

Breathing heavily, she quickly knocked and entered. Darian was still there, handling some paperwork. Surprised by her sudden entrance, Darian’s eyes widened.

“Bell?”

“I’m sorry for changing my mind so suddenly.”



“Would it be all right if I went to Lord Philip’s estate?”

Darian, looking slightly surprised, soon smiled gently.

“All right. It won’t be an easy task, but I trust you will handle it well.”

Her words, spoken with solid trust, settled warmly in Lisbell’s heart.

Lisbell didn’t want to betray that trust.


The car carrying three people came to a gentle stop.

As one of the doors opened, the air brushed against their faces, slightly different from the one they had experienced at the monastery.

The monastery beneath the jagged cliffs, reminiscent of a delicate landscape painting, had a fresher and more vibrant scent. On the other hand, this place carried the scent of daily life, the kind of smell that could easily be named as “the smell of people.”

It was both welcoming and, deep down, unsettling.

“You’ve come.”

As soon as they got out of the car, a voice, wet with emotion, greeted them. Lord Philip had come to the garden to welcome the guests.

It had only been two days since their last meeting, but his face looked much more worn. Without even asking, it was easy to guess that he had stayed up all night by his daughter’s side, who had suffered a sudden seizure.

Lord Philip extended his hand to each of the people who got out of the car: the priest Meteo, the nun Miriam who had been dispatched with Lisbell, and finally, Lisbell herself.

Before Lisbell could take the hand that was extended to her, she flinched. Fortunately, it wasn’t obvious, and Lord Philip shook her hand warmly, gripping it tightly before letting go.

Lisbell lingered her gaze on the back of his hand as he pulled away.

It felt different, indeed.

Visually, and tactically.

It was not the same hand she had touched at the confessional. Lord Philip’s hand was much drier, rough with areas that seemed to have been worn down by hardship.

It was a relief that it wasn’t the hand that had grasped her Achilles tendon so vividly, but she couldn’t let her guard down.

So, what had she actually felt back then?

Was it just a mistake?

Was it because of her bad condition at the time?

Or was it the disoriented aftermath of a sense of relief?

She didn’t have time to dwell on these thoughts. Lord Philip, seemingly moved by the visit from the monastery, dismissed the servants and took it upon himself to guide them. There was nothing strange about his courteous demeanor; after all, he had sent a carriage for the dispatched people to ensure they arrived comfortably and quickly.

As Lisbell walked at the end of the line, she looked around the corridor inside the mansion. Miriam, who had been ahead of her, was looking around with audible admiration. But Lisbell didn’t share that sense of awe. It was a very magnificent and elegant place, but having already seen the Altahart Mansion, she couldn’t help but notice the differences.

“I am very grateful that you came,” Lord Philip said. “Before you go to the guest room, would you mind meeting Sawyer first?”

“Yes, of course.”

Lord Philip and the priest exchanged a brief conversation, and they were soon headed to his daughter’s room. When they arrived, Lisbell couldn’t help but swallow in nervousness.

The bedroom felt almost empty, or rather, devoid of any sign of use. To be precise, there were no traces of it being lived in. The geometric patterned table with silver foil, the winged chair with a soft pink cushion, and the other furniture were neatly arranged as if they had never been used.

But there was one area that was clearly in disarray—the bed, which occupied most of the room.

Sawyer Vinchest was lying there.

Seeing the child in person for the first time, Lisbell only felt one thing: pity.

The child, who was supposed to be eight years old, was much smaller than expected. Though dressed in fine pajamas, her limbs were so thin that it was obvious she was frail. Her small face, on the other hand, was swollen, probably from crying all night due to pain.

The sound of Sawyer’s labored breathing echoed around the bed. Lord Philip approached the child’s head and spoke softly.

“Please forgive us, Sawyer has just fallen asleep and couldn’t greet you.”

“It’s alright. I heard her seizures were severe. Has she calmed down now?”

“She suffers from intermittent symptoms whenever she’s conscious, so we gave her a sedative, and she’s now asleep.”

Lord Philip then expressed his hope that the priest and nun would take turns guarding his daughter’s room. Since the main purpose of coming to the mansion was to watch over Sawyer’s condition and pray for her, the situation was quickly settled.

Before evening, it was decided that the priest would remain in charge, and Lisbell and Miriam naturally withdrew. Lord Philip seemed to have something else to say, so he instructed a servant to guide them. A maid who had been standing off to the side approached them and told them to follow.

It was as they were heading to the guest room on the second floor that a slight opening of a door caught Lisbell’s attention.

Perhaps because it faced the west, the room gave off the feeling of early dawn, with a soft, almost ethereal atmosphere. While sunlight flooded the garden and courtyard outside, this particular room seemed unusually pale in comparison. Inside, Lisbell noticed an object that blended perfectly with the background.

A chessboard.

It looked as though someone had been in the middle of a game and had to leave abruptly, as the pieces, black and white, filled the squares.

She only caught a glimpse of it as she passed by and didn’t linger any further.

The guest room Lord Philip had prepared for them wasn’t very bright, but it was undoubtedly luxurious. Moreover, it seemed that he wanted to give each person their own private space, as Miriam had a room of her own across the hall.

As Lisbell sat down to catch her breath, she heard a knock. It was Miriam, the same person she had just parted from.

“This room is so fancy, I can’t stand it. Bell, can I stay here with you?”

“Sure. Come in.”

Miriam had told her that she came from a rural mountain village. After spending time in the monastery’s modest lodging, with an old bed pushed against the wall and a worn wooden table, stepping into such a spacious room—large enough to accommodate at least fifty people—was undoubtedly overwhelming for her.

If it had been herself two years ago, Lisbell would have felt the same.

But now, after having tasted so many different aspects of wealth, Lisbell had become accustomed to the variety of the world. From the almost paradisiacal Marniya to the power-laden capital city, and the vibrant and colorful Lorant, there was no longer much that could unsettle her.

In spaces occupied by Ulrich, where his traces remained, there was a sharp and oppressive sense of power that almost felt like it was rotting away. Having experienced him firsthand, Lisbell didn’t find herself overly awed by visiting Lord Philip’s mansion for the first time.

“I’ve never been in a place like this before. Our monastery’s chapel was fancy, but this is something else.”

“Well, it is a noble’s mansion.”

“Bell, you’ve been really calm since earlier. Have you been to a place like this before?”

Just as Lisbell had observed Miriam, Miriam seemed to be scrutinizing her as well. Caught off guard by the question, Lisbell paused for a moment and then faintly smiled.

“No, I haven’t…”



“It’s my first time too.”

She had experienced such things, but they were memories she wanted to forget.

Everything related to that man was so chaotic and painful that she wanted to sever it all, to cut it off completely. If she could, she would erase it from her consciousness entirely. The anxiety she had felt a few days ago only made those memories more unbearable.

The fact that such horrible memories had been etched into her mind, restricting her like a chain around her neck, made her tongue stiff with frustration.

Lisbell swallowed once more and sat down in the wing chair. Miriam approached and quietly sat next to her, whispering.

“By the way, did you see earlier? Lord Philip’s daughter. She looked worse than I expected.”

“Yes… It’s really sad to hear that they had to sedate her to get her to sleep.”

“When Lord Philip was coming to the monastery every day, I wondered how desperate he must have been. Seeing his daughter in person, I can understand why. She’s still so young.”

The image of the frail girl, lying almost swallowed up by the large bed, flashed in Lisbell’s mind. She couldn’t help but feel a strange, almost painful sensation stir in her chest.

It reminded her of her mother.

As Miriam had said, before coming to the mansion, Lisbell had also wondered whether Lord Philip was asking too much, perhaps expecting more than was reasonable. Religious influence wasn’t something that could be imposed on individuals at will, and although she might seem somewhat unspiritual, Lisbell had doubts about whether the prayers of the faithful could truly heal someone suffering so deeply.

In a world where scientifically proven medicine existed, it felt almost naive to rely on such unscientific hopes.


But when she actually saw his sick daughter, Lisbell realized that such doubts could not even be considered. While medicine was being relied upon, it was not enough to ease the heart.

She had been receiving adequate medical support from Ulrich through a contract that involved her body, and while there was nothing more she could do, Lord Philip, on the other hand, had the position and wealth to at least place his hopes in religion.

If there was anything he could mobilize before his daughter’s breath truly left her, he would have done it, even if it were prayers whose efficacy was unproven.

Knowing the desperate longing of submission all too well, Lisbell couldn’t simply turn a blind eye to it.

With her eyes lowered, Lisbell murmured quietly.

“Let’s pray that Lady Sawyer can make it through the night.”

“Yes.”

After exchanging some casual conversation with Miriam, the sound of a knock interrupted them.

It was the servant who had previously escorted them to their respective rooms.

“I will escort you to the dining room for dinner.”

Though they were essentially commoners, the servant’s attitude was particularly respectful, likely due to the fact that they were guests personally invited by the master of the house. Lisbell, now feeling a bit uncomfortable, descended to the first floor with Miriam.

At the dinner table, Lisbell had expected it would just be the two of them, but there was someone already present—Lord Philip, whom she had parted from earlier in Sawyer’s room. She looked around, wondering where Father Meteo had gone.

Lord Philip, seated at the head of the table, mentioned that after the two of them finished eating, Father Meteo would join them for dinner. It seemed that, as had been arranged earlier, one of them was always meant to stay by his daughter’s side.

“Thank you both, and especially to you, Bell, for agreeing to my stubbornness,” he said, alternating his gaze between the two before focusing on Lisbell.

“Bell. I am especially grateful to you.”

For a brief moment, his gaze held an ambiguous meaning before he gestured to the dishes, urging them to begin eating.

Lord Philip personally served Lisbell by placing a dish in front of her, dismissing the servant who had approached with the new food. It seemed like he was concerned about her reaction to his shocking behavior in the confessional earlier, so Lisbell smiled slightly in appreciation.

During the meal, light conversation flowed, mostly about Sawyer. Eventually, the conversation ran out, and a silence settled over the table.

As Lisbell took a spoonful of the clear chicken soup Lord Philip had served, she suddenly had a thought and asked.

“Lord, is chess one of your hobbies?”

“Chess?”

“Yes. I think I saw a chessboard in a room with the door slightly ajar earlier.”

Expecting a response that would match the casual nature of her question, Lisbell was taken aback when Lord Philip seemed to respond as though he were hearing of an entirely unrelated topic.

“Well, I wouldn’t say it’s a hobby. When I was single, I played a few times at a social club, but I never really found it enjoyable, so I haven’t touched it since I got married. That’s why there aren’t any chess pieces in the mansion.”

“Huh? But I saw a chessboard earlier…”

“A chessboard? Well, I’m not sure… maybe you’ve mistaken something.”

No chess pieces at all?

Then what was it that I saw?

Lisbell felt a strange chill for a moment, as though she were playing some sort of foolish prank. But Lord Philip quickly moved on to a different subject, as though he genuinely believed she had made a mistake.

Lisbell, now confused, stopped chewing her food.

For a moment, an uncomfortable sensation lingered.

It felt as though her fingers had just brushed against a thin sheet of paper, cutting through her.

…Again?

Am I mistaken again?

The unease, which she could not swallow calmly, caught in her throat, and she couldn’t help but feel unsettled.

She forced herself to take another spoonful of soup. The flavor was rich and the taste exquisite, yet strangely, it felt as though she were eating sand.



After finishing their meal, Lisbell and Miriam made their way to Sawyer’s bedroom. As they walked, Lisbell cast uneasy glances around.

The chessboard kept swirling in her mind.

Did I really see it wrong?

But was it possible to mistake a square chessboard with pieces for something else?

It had flashed by so quickly, but it was clearly a chessboard.

In fact, if it had been someone else, she might have been able to lightly pass it off as, “Yeah, I guess I saw it wrong,” but Lisbell had a memory that she couldn’t do that. There had already been a misunderstanding once, one that she couldn’t figure out and couldn’t resolve.

 

The beautiful hand she had encountered at the confession.

 

Lisbell quietly rubbed the back of her neck hidden behind the veil. The unidentified cold air that had dug in again stimulated her wounds sharply.

 

If possible, she wanted to go back to the room she had seen earlier and confirm that what she had seen with her own two eyes was the chessboard, but it was realistically impossible. She had been guided by a servant earlier, so she didn’t know the exact location of the room that was open, and it was also urgent to exchange places with the priest who had been keeping watch with a hungry stomach while they were eating.

 

She gave up faster than she thought.

 

Lisbell arrived at Sawyer’s bedroom without being able to find out the truth. After a brief conversation with the priest, the two of them now stayed by Sawyer’s side.

 

While the two took turns reciting the prayer of rest in their mouths, the servants often approached the bed to check on the young lady’s comfort.

 

In the meantime.

 



 

Lisbell, who was holding the scripture, raised her hand and rubbed her eyes.

 

At some point, her eyelids became heavy. They closed against her will, as if a solid rock had been placed on them. For a moment, she thought she was falling asleep, but it was a little different. Rather than the temptation of sleep, it felt like her whole body was being spurred on by her unwillingness.

 

She shook the scripture in her hand a few times and cleared her dizzy eyes several times, and then something fell to the floor with a thud.

 

“Ah… Sorry.”

 

The strength in her hand completely disappeared and the Bible fell. Because it was quite thick, the sound of it falling was quite loud. Lisbell noticed the eyes gathering here and there and offered a formal apology. Even in this situation, her eyes were spinning and it was hard to maintain her posture.

 

“Bell? What’s wrong?”

 

Miriam on the other side asked Lisbell, whose complexion had changed from a moment ago. Lisbell, who had bent her legs to pick up the Bible, realized that her body was in a state where she could collapse, so she covered her forehead. As she closed her eyes tightly, she felt her nerves lose strength one by one as if they were all loose. It wouldn’t be strange if she fainted right away.

 

“Miriam. Sorry… I don’t think I’m feeling well.”

 

“What? Really?”

 

“Uh, um…”

 

Miriam quickly turned around the bed and came over, realizing the seriousness of Lisbell’s condition, who couldn’t even put together a sentence properly.

 

“Why are you acting like this all of a sudden? Did you have some trouble while eating?”

 

“I don’t know… uh. But if I keep going like this… I’m just going to be a nuisance…”

 

Even though she was standing still, it was hard to keep her wits about her as if someone was grabbing her hair and shaking her back and forth. Miriam looked around in confusion as she whispered in a tone that seemed to be flowing intermittently, then whispered softly.

 

“Bell, you go back to your room first and rest. As I said, if you collapse first, it would be a big deal. There are two of us, so it wouldn’t be a big problem if only one of us remained. I’ll tell the priest later.”

 

Lisbell nodded her head in gratitude for Miriam’s consideration and left the bedroom with slow movements.

 

When she returned to the room she was guided to, she was almost crawling in. Lisbell barely made it to the bed and collapsed.

 

What was the problem?

 

The meal?

 

Did she maybe have food poisoning? However, it was far from the symptoms of poisoning. Or maybe a medicine she took… However, she herself didn’t remember taking anything like that.

 

She blinked her eyes a few times, but her consciousness quickly dispersed. Her vision suddenly blacked out with an unknown number of shivers.

 

And when she came to her senses again, it was already well past night.

 

“… Hmm.”

 

Lisbell barely opened her dry eyelids, which seemed drier than the desert.

 

An unfamiliar ceiling greeted her.

 

She stopped as she moved her arms to rub her eyes. She hurriedly raised her upper body, which had been frozen in that state. The blanket covering her shoulders slid down.

 

A bright beam of light pouring down from the open curtains illuminated her naked body, which was not covered by a single thread.

 

Naked…?

 

She had no memory of sleeping naked the night before. The discomfort that her body had acquired first covered her entire body with goosebumps. Her hands, which had begun to tremble, lifted the blanket that had flowed down to her navel.

 

A silent gasp formed on the tip of her tongue.

 

The inside of her thighs were soaked with an unknown liquid.

 
“What is this…?”

 

She hurriedly pulled off the blanket. It wasn’t just the unknown, viscous substance on her thighs.

 

The flesh on the inside of her thighs was mottled with reddish bruises. Just looking at this area, it was in such a terrible state that it looked like she had a horrible skin disease. As if she had been savagely bitten by a wild dog.

 

She, who had been looking down in shock, quickly covered her mouth with her hand. Holding her breath tightly, Lisbell suddenly lifted her head.

 

Her violet eyes, filled with fear, turned as if unable to find their composure. However, contrary to her worries, the bedroom was exactly as she had seen it yesterday. It still displayed an intricate neatness, as it was a room reserved for guests, while maintaining its formality and dignity.

 

The only one who had become horrifically strange in this room was me.

 

Lisbell hurriedly got out of bed.

 

“Ugh…!”

 

As she pushed off the ground with his foot, it felt as if someone had kicked her in the back of the knee, and she collapsed forward.

 

She lay sprawled in a pitiful state, gasping for breath.

 

It felt like dark storm clouds were gathering behind her, unseen. Believing that if her sky were covered by them, it would truly be the end, Lisbell crawled slowly.

 

When she finally reached the bathroom, she gagged and heaved up the contents of her stomach. As the stomach acid surged back up, her throat felt as if it were being stabbed with a burning knife.

 

Her eyes, which had been shaking for a long time, stopped moving. Her fingertips, as pale as her complexion, brushed over the bodily fluids that trickled down her thigh, making a faint sound.

 

Just her imagination…?

 

Again?

 

Was this also her delusion?

 

“No…”

 

That can’t be.

 

How could this be called a delusion?

 

The lingering creepy sensation on her body, the gruesome marks left on her pale skin, and this unpleasant residue on her fingertips.

 

It was all real.

 

Something had really happened to her!

 

Even amidst all this, it was utterly absurd. Even after pushing her to the brink of confusion, she still couldn’t find that person no matter where she looked.

 

The panic she experienced a few days ago and the anxiety that she couldn’t help but feel from time to time were all a real nightmare personally delivered by that man. It wasn’t her who was imagining things; it was him who was causing such things.

 

Even going so far as to use such methods that didn’t reveal himself until the very end.

 

Lisbell mustered all her strength to steady her trembling legs. She turned the faucet and jumped into the torrent of water. She scrubbed so hard and painfully that her skin felt like it was peeling off. She scrubbed every inch of her body, leaving no trace behind.

 

Under the hot water, her delicate skin turned red, but she didn’t care. By the time she felt that rubbing wasn’t enough, she instinctively used her nails. The barely healing scratch was once again torn open without any satisfaction.

 

When she turned off the faucet that had been pouring water for quite a while, an eerie silence enveloped the bathroom. Lisbell raised her hand and slowly wiped her face. The dampness dripped from her palm with a plop. The sensation of the droplets crawling down her skin was enough to induce a strange chill.

 

“Clothes… my clothes.”

 

Lisbell hurriedly rushed out of the bathroom and frantically searched for her clothes.

 

She found them behind the bed. Without even thinking of drying herself with a towel, Lisbell shoved her arms and legs into them haphazardly. She knew the buttons were mismatched and ugly creases were forming in the clothes, but she couldn’t stop. Lisbell acted like someone incapable of normal reasoning.

 

The cloth covering her shoulders became damp from her thoroughly wet hair. Still, she was steadfastly buttoning her clothes.

Knock knock.

The sound of knocking roused her consciousness in an instant.

To say it knocked might have been an understatement—it felt as though her brain had been physically struck.

Every nerve was on edge, bristling like needles.

Lisbell turned toward the door with an unnatural, puppet-like motion. Though she had no mirror before her, she was certain her face had gone completely pale.

Knock knock.

The knock resounded again, this time like a hammer blow.

Frozen in place like a statue, Lisbell finally moved toward the door with halting steps. Just as she reached for the doorknob, her pupils dilated. Her temples throbbed, as though a foreboding presence was rushing toward her from the distance.

She pressed her dry tongue against the roof of her mouth.

Exhaling slowly, she opened the door impulsively, almost without thinking.

“Bell. You’re awake? Sorry to come so early, but—what’s wrong with your face?”

It was Miriam.

The tidal wave of tension that had crashed over her ebbed away like a retreating tide. The heightened sensitivity in her mind deflated abruptly, leaving her feeling weak.

Lisbell stood still for a moment, then clutched her forehead as dizziness overcame her.

“I… didn’t sleep well. What’s the matter?”

“Didn’t rest well last night? Actually… the priest said we need to return to the monastery right away.”

The hand rubbing her forehead froze.

“Right away? Why? Did something happen at the monastery?”

“Well, to be precise…”

Miriam glanced around nervously, as if wary of eavesdroppers, then lowered her voice to a whisper.

“We need to leave. Lord Philip has issued an expulsion order.”

Lisbell’s hand clenched tightly around the doorknob.

…What?

She thought she must have misheard, but Miriam’s expression remained unchanged, confirming what she’d just said.

On Lisbell’s already pale face, a flicker of bewilderment surfaced. Just yesterday, she’d been greeted with such a warm welcome—what could have caused this sudden reversal overnight?

“An expulsion order?”

“We need to go. The priest is waiting. Do you have anything else to pack?”

Miriam’s urgency made it clear that something serious was going on. Flustered, Lisbell hurriedly followed her out of the room. By the time they reached the front entrance, a car was already waiting.

As soon as they got in, the car started without delay. Unlike the warmth of the previous day’s reception, the send-off was cold and unceremonious.

The car ride back to the monastery was steeped in silence. Of the three passengers, Lisbell was the most perplexed. There had been no time to process what had happened before she was dragged away.

After some hesitation, she leaned toward Miriam and whispered, “Did something happen to Miss Sawyer?”

“No. I stayed with her until dawn, and she was fine the whole time.”

Lisbell had wondered if something had happened to the young lady’s health, causing the lord to become unbalanced, but it seemed that wasn’t the case. Then why? The lack of clarity only deepened her confusion. She turned to stare out of the window, her thoughts churning. Beneath her long skirt, she couldn’t ignore the sensation between her legs. Was it a relief that she’d left the estate? If she’d stayed there any longer…

No. She didn’t know.

She truly didn’t know.

What in the world was going on?

What had caused her body’s strange state the day before, or the fluid and marks she’d found on her inner thighs that morning? Why had Lord Philip’s attitude shifted so dramatically overnight?

‘…Ulrich Altahart.’

Could it really be… that he was here, somewhere near her?

Fragments of speculation, unconfirmed and nebulous, swirled in her mind. The car eventually arrived at the monastery. The priest who greeted them instructed the two women to return to their quarters. Frustrated though she was, Lisbell complied.

The day passed in a haze, the plans for it disrupted and left in limbo.

It was as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the land in shadow, that the priest came to Lisbell’s room.

“Bell, Darian has asked to see you.”

A chill ran down her spine.

It felt as if an ominous gun barrel, teetering all day, had finally taken aim squarely at her.

Swallowing nervously, Lisbell followed the priest.

Darian was waiting in the same private room they had used two days prior—where Lord Philip had first introduced her. Though the setting was familiar, the atmosphere was far heavier now. It was suffocating in a way it hadn’t been before.

“Bell, given the gravity of the situation, I’ll get straight to the point. What happened at Lord Philip’s estate?”

“What? What do you mean…?”

“A formal complaint has been lodged by Lord Philip. He claims you committed a deeply offensive act last night.”

“…What?”

The absurd accusation left her stunned. If she hadn’t braced herself, she might have collapsed under the weight of the sudden dizziness. The image of Lord Philip smiling warmly at her the previous evening flashed in her mind, only to dissipate.

“I pressed him for details, but he refused, saying he found it too distasteful to recount. He suggested I ask you directly. Bell, I need you to answer truthfully.”

Lisbell instinctively shook her head.

“I didn’t… I didn’t do anything, Darian.”

Her voice trembled, stretched thin by anxiety.

She knew exactly what kind of questioning would follow such a statement.

“According to Priest Meteo’s report, everything was fine through dinner. He mentioned that you separated afterward. Where were you, and what were you doing?”

Ah…

Another sigh escaped her, laden with despair.



She was innocent and upright.

She could place a hand over her heart and assert it with conviction.

Not once had she considered, much less attempted, anything that might offend Lord Philip, who had looked upon her with pity as if seeing his younger self. She had never harbored any malicious intent to harm him.

But now, the words she was about to speak felt like they would undermine her resolute will and drag her into deeper trouble. Darian’s sharp gaze seemed to scold her silent lips mercilessly.

Lisbell’s eyes dropped weakly to the floor. She couldn’t bring herself to meet that gaze.

“Well, I… last night, the truth is…”



“After dinner, I wasn’t feeling well. I informed Miriam and rested in my room.”

“Do you have anyone who can corroborate that?”

“…No.”

“What did you do after returning to your room?”

“I fell asleep.”

“And that’s all?”

“Yes.”

Darian covered her mouth with her hand, seemingly lost in thought or at a loss for words.

Standing there, Lisbell felt as though she were a criminal on trial, her chest tightening painfully. Her senses were paralyzed, unsure where to look, what to say, or how to act.

It felt as though she was being slowly driven into some unknown abyss.

A hard, shallow breath rose from the depths of her lungs.

“Is that really all? Do you have no other memories?”

“That’s… all. Nothing unusual happened. I mean, I fell asleep and… but I’m sure that after falling asleep…”

“Is it possible that you unintentionally did something that might have upset Lord Philip? Think carefully, Bell. This is a serious matter for you as well.”



“Lord Philip has included a petition alongside the formal complaint, requesting your expulsion from the monastery. As you know, Lord Philip is a guest we cannot afford to overlook at the moment. The stronger his claims, the harder it will be for us to protect you.”

Darian’s long statement struck Lisbell’s mind like a bolt of lightning.

Expulsion from the monastery.

A guest they couldn’t afford to overlook.

Protecting her would be difficult.

“…Ah…”

She was utterly dazed.

Now she finally understood.

Since when?

Since when had the foundation of her world started to crumble like this?

She didn’t know much, but one thing was certain: someone was trying to force her out of this place, even resorting to such insidious pressure.

And that someone was undoubtedly…

“So, before I joined, didn’t I ask?”

Darian, who had been staring at the wall with a troubled look, turned toward her. Their gazes, however, didn’t meet. Lisbell’s empty, half-dead eyes were fixed beyond Darian’s shoulder.

“How far can faith protect me?”



“At the time, you told me that if I so wished, no one could remove me from here. So why has that changed now? I felt a sense of stability in this place—a stability I thought I would never feel again. That alone made me happy. But now, why… why am I being cast aside again?”

The bitterness of being stripped of her autonomy and reduced to a pawn in someone’s base desires reared its head, fueling her sense of injustice.

“It’s not me. I swear, I’ve done nothing to insult Lord Philip. This must be that man’s doing…!”

Her voice, rising like an impassioned denunciation, was abruptly cut off, as if severed by a blade. Even her lips, poised to spill more, froze. Instinct demanded it, and rationality followed a moment later.

How far could she go?

If it would prove her innocence, Lisbell would have stripped bare before Darian without hesitation.

She wanted to scream that her body had undergone inexplicable changes the moment she collapsed into bed in the guest room, that it was not Lord Philip but herself who had endured some unspeakable act in the night.

But she couldn’t.

“A celibate body.”

She had fallen victim to the very rules she had rationalized her way into breaking.

Even though she had washed away the fluids, there was no immediate way to erase the bite-like marks left on her skin. To Lisbell’s experienced eyes, those marks were unmistakable signs of a passionate encounter with someone.

She couldn’t speak.

If she did, she’d be expelled for violating the rules.

“Bell?”

Darian’s concerned voice called her name as Lisbell, who had been vehemently defending herself, suddenly fell silent as if her tongue had been cut. But Lisbell couldn’t hear her. The chilling cold that gnawed at her limbs made it feel like all the blood was draining from her body.

“…I don’t know.”



“I don’t know… either.”

Trapped in a dreadful state of uncertainty, the only words Lisbell could muster were irresponsibly vague.

With a sigh, Darian told her that she would speak with Lord Philip again and sent Lisbell away.

The long corridor was swallowed by the night, its ambiguous darkness consuming everything diagonally. The shadows pooled heavily, feeling especially damp and oppressive tonight. Lisbell’s steps seemed to sink into the void as she walked.

‘How…?’

Her footsteps echoed in the silent night.

‘How can I stay here…?’

Without revealing her flaws.

Without falling into that man’s grasp.

How?

Whenever she tried to think through the situation, her mind would blank out completely. An ominous sense that any attempt to resolve things would only lead to further disasters gripped her by the nape, refusing to let go. Even if her body escaped, her mind felt shackled, endlessly bound to someone’s cruel domain.

“You’re so naive…”

Flinch.

It was as if someone were mocking her weakness. A man’s derisive laughter, sickeningly sweet in tone, lingered in her ears.

“I can do as I please.”

“Do you really think so?”

“Lisbell, you overthink for someone so naive. That only ever makes things worse.”

Slap.

Lisbell slapped her own left cheek forcefully.

The unsettling hallucination ceased.

But only briefly. Her resistance seemed to provoke it even more.

Ha-ha.

A cruel chuckle filled with mockery and disdain clawed at her ears, as if the voice were looking down on her with contemptuous amusement.

Ha-ha-ha.

It felt like a venomous insect crawling through her ears, writhing its legs grotesquely.

“Shut up…”

Slap! Slap! Slap!

She slapped both her ears repeatedly as her pace quickened. Her cheeks burned from the sharp sting of her blows, yet she felt nothing but cold. It was as though she’d been plunged into the depths of a freezing winter.

“Shut up. Shut up. Shut up… Shut up, shut up…! Shut up!”

Why won’t it stop?

She knew it was a hallucination, yet it wouldn’t fade away.

Lisbell found herself running through the corridor. The endlessly stretching passage felt oppressively claustrophobic tonight.

How strange.

This wasn’t Marnia. It wasn’t the Altahart mansion, nor was it Ulrich’s extravagantly decorated bedroom.

And yet, the laughter that had always dragged her into darkness refused to stop following her.

“Huff, huff…”

She ran until her throat tasted of blood. Leaning against a pillar, Lisbell wavered like a straw doll before collapsing to the ground.

Her body alternated between cold and heat. Her ears and cheeks, reddened from her impulsive self-inflicted blows, ached, while her overworked lungs felt like they were about to burst. Yet her hands and feet were numb, as though frostbitten and decaying.

Feeling the contradictory sensations, she looked up in a daze. For the first time, the moon came into view, dispelling the surrounding darkness. The moonlight was so bright it felt like her eyes might go blind. Staring into the blue luminescence, Lisbell finally faced the truth she had long avoided.

‘…It’s over.’

This place could not be her salvation.

Even if she survived this ordeal, could she guarantee there wouldn’t be another? How many more dishonorable accusations would she have to endure? How much longer before her very presence became a burden? If this cycle continued, would her existence itself not eventually turn into a sin?

Lisbell couldn’t bear to let it go that far.

She didn’t have the strength.

The brief time she had spent here had been precious and comforting, like fertile soil on barren land.

The wind howled.

The veil covering her head fluttered weakly like a surrendered white flag. She gripped it and slowly pulled it off, the gesture one of resignation.

The wind blew harder.

The spring night’s breeze, sharp and relentless, teased her unevenly cut gray hair, making it dance. Somewhere nearby, the sound of fabric flapping accompanied the gusts.

“What a waste.”

Step.

What followed was the sound of measured footsteps.

“There’s no internal rule saying you have to cut your hair.”

The wind stopped abruptly.

The moment she became aware of it, Lisbell’s world was overtaken by the overwhelming presence of the speaker.

…A hallucination?

Again?

Lisbell slowly raised her hand, intending to escape through self-inflicted pain as before, but her body refused to obey. Her instincts had already recognized that what was happening was not merely a sensory illusion.

This wasn’t a hallucination.

“Why would you cut such beautiful hair…?”

The deep, languid voice curled around her ears like a liquid, now resonating directly behind her.


A chilling shiver ran down Lisbell’s stiffened nape, like icy beads crawling over her skin.

Something brushed the ends of her hair.

Was it just the playful teasing of a gentle breeze?

No, it wasn’t.

“This is all mine. Who gave you permission?”

Fingers.

Without even needing to look, Lisbell could vividly picture the delicate, refined fingers of the man who now entwined strands of her unruly gray hair in his grasp, idly twirling them. Though his gesture was lighthearted, the air around them seemed to freeze further. The veil clenched in her hands crumpled miserably as mounting tension made her grip tighter and tighter.

Lisbell was all too familiar with what those hands could do. For now, they moved with an unsettling ease, but she knew how abruptly they could turn savage, how suddenly they might seize her hair in a brutal grip.

And those hands—graceful yet massive—could easily encircle her neck, suffocating her with a single motion. She had experienced that choking grip often enough to know the terror it brought.

Her mouth filled with sticky saliva, a physiological response to the unbearable tension. Yet, she couldn’t even swallow it, so acute was her fear.

Though she desperately hoped otherwise, the likelihood of escape seemed slim.

Her stiffened neck creaked as she slowly turned her head.

And when she finally looked back, Lisbell felt as though her very heart had been pierced.

“Hello.”

The man’s sculpted face smiled serenely under the radiant moonlight that poured down upon him.

“I’m back.”

His voice carried the tone of someone who had wandered long and finally found his cozy cradle. The deliberate, melodic drawl in his words hinted at an intimate eagerness, like someone ready to throw himself entirely into that cradle.

This wasn’t an illusion. Nor a hallucination.

The voice, the demeanor, the overpowering presence that smothered her in its terrifying tranquility—it was all unmistakable.

Unfortunately for Lisbell, he was exactly as she remembered him.

In a clumsy attempt to rise, she tripped over her feet and fell.

But even then, she couldn’t stop moving, desperately crawling backward.

She knew all too well how futile it was. Such feeble resistance wouldn’t even take her beyond his shadow, let alone out of his sight. Still, when faced with the calamity now standing before her, her mind had shrunk to the level of a mere insect, seeking escape by any means, however pitiful.

Meanwhile, Ulrich leisurely rose from his seat, watching her retreat with a composed gaze. His trench coat fluttered gracefully in the breeze over a perfectly tailored suit.

His platinum hair, far richer in luster than her dull gray locks, shimmered as he ran a hand through it.

The oppressive intensity of his gaze, which bound her like chains, disappeared momentarily as his hand covered his eyes. That brief respite allowed Lisbell to stagger to her feet, bracing herself against the ground.

Clenching her teeth, she bolted in the opposite direction.

“Hah…! Huff…!”

She hadn’t even run far, yet her lungs already burned, as though they were collapsing under the strain. This wasn’t merely physical exhaustion. Her chest felt as though anxiety itself were simmering within, intensifying with each beat of her heart.

She crossed the long corridor and burst into the grand chapel ahead.

“Please, please…!”

There were two ways to lock the chapel doors: with a key or by using the latch at the top of the frame. The keyhole was at waist height, but the latch was positioned far higher. With no key on her person, she tiptoed frantically, reaching up with trembling hands to grasp the latch.

“Please… just…!”

The latch, which was usually within easy reach, now felt as distant as a flower on a cliff. She knew it was her panic clouding her judgment, but she couldn’t calm down. Her erratic heartbeat and suffocating dread made any semblance of composure impossible.

In stark contrast to her frantic efforts, the man approaching behind her walked with leisurely grace. He neither hurried nor faltered, exuding the serene poise of a swan gliding across a lake. She could vividly picture him beyond the chapel doors, his coat swaying gently as he advanced with unsettling ease.

“…Ah…!”

Finally, she managed to grab hold of the latch. She just needed to turn it now—just one motion, and a temporary barrier would separate them.

But before she could secure it, an overwhelming force suddenly shoved the door open, throwing her backward.

What had been tightly shut flew wide as if it had been nothing more than paper.

Ulrich slowly lowered his left leg, which had just delivered the devastating kick. The brief display of brute force gave him an air of lawlessness, but just as quickly, his polished demeanor returned, his posture resuming its calculated elegance.

Yet to Lisbell, who knew his true nature, he remained nothing more than a harbinger of darkness.

“Ah… hic…!”

Tears of despair welled in her eyes as she choked on her own gasping breaths.

Lisbell, unable to withstand the force of the door slammed open by Ulrich’s kick, was flung backward, collapsing onto the floor.

She needed to escape, to find another path, but her ankle seemed injured from the fall—she couldn’t put much strength into it. In the end, all she could do was crawl across the chapel floor, desperately trying to put distance between them.

The wide-open door groaned as it slowly swung shut again, plunging the chapel into a dim, shadowy gloom.

“Of all places, why hide in a church?”

The sharp, deliberate sound of his footsteps echoed in the silence—click, click.

That sound alone carried the weight of something dreadful, like darkness itself striding toward her. Lisbell instinctively sought out the nearest source of light.

“As much as I dislike meddling with religion, even I have my limits,” he mused, his tone light but sinister.

Flickering candlelight glimmered in the distance.

It came from the altar. A sacred area forbidden even to most priests unless explicitly permitted. Only the abbot and vice abbot were allowed to access it, where ceremonial relics were kept alongside rows of candles encased in glass domes, ensuring their flames never extinguished.

Lisbell crawled desperately past rows of pews and finally reached the altar’s steps. Just as she grasped the edge of the first step, a hand clamped down on her ankle.

“Still, I guess it’s fine. After all, we’ve finally reunited.”

Her efforts to reach the altar were for nothing; she was dragged back across the floor.

“Lisbell, why do you keep running away?”

“Agh…!”

“It’s been so long. Don’t you think that’s a bit cold of you?”

“Let go, let go of me… let go!”

“Or should I call you Bell? That fits the mood better, doesn’t it?”

Her struggles became frantic as she tried to shake off his serpent-like grip. But her wide, terrified eyes met his face as he loomed over her, a crooked smile tugging at his lips.

“Ah, that dumbfounded expression of yours….”



“It’s been so long. How exciting.”

Ulrich tightened his hold on Lisbell’s ankle, dragging her closer.

Her heel brushed against the open coat he wore over his perfectly tailored trousers. The polished fabric shifted under her skin, transmitting the sensation of something rigid and alive beneath. His excitement swelled, unrestrained, against her exposed ankle.

Disgust surged within her, boiling over.

“Stop it! It’s disgusting—so disgusting!”

“Disgusting?”

Ulrich let out a sharp laugh, as though she’d just said something utterly absurd.

Even as he chuckled, his hands moved deftly. He stripped off her shoe and sock, exposing her bare foot. Without hesitation, he pressed it against the bulge in his trousers, grinding it against him with obscene force.

“Ah… I feel like I could finish just like this,” he murmured, his voice laced with lewd satisfaction.

Despite the pressure her foot applied, his arousal only seemed to grow. He groaned softly, savoring the sensation.

Lisbell clenched her teeth, then lashed out with her free leg, kicking with all her might. The movement was wild and frenzied, driven by sheer desperation.

Her heel struck his face with a dull thud, jerking his head to the side. His grip on her ankle weakened, and she seized the chance to wrench herself free. Scrambling to her knees, she crawled up the altar steps.

Something, anything—she needed a weapon.

Her frantic gaze darted around until it landed on a golden candlestick. She grabbed it tightly, but as she turned to defend herself, she was yanked backward with brutal force.

Her knees scraped harshly against the floor as she collapsed, losing hold of the candlestick.

“Ugh…!”

Before she could recover, a hand seized her arm, spinning her around.

Light filtered through the stained glass, painting her surroundings in cold, pale hues.

“That hurts.”

“Ughhh….”

“Is it okay for a nun to resort to violence like this?”

A faint smear of blood glistened on Ulrich’s split lip.

Yet he seemed utterly unfazed, brushing his hand carelessly across his mouth. The disinterested look on his face, coupled with the way he narrowed his eyes in mock pain, made it painfully obvious he was putting on a show.

Lisbell could only watch, paralyzed with rage and dread, as he loomed closer once again.


And as if he had no intention of hiding it, he immediately curved his eyes into a sly smile.

“Well. You wouldn’t be able to become an official priest anyway.”



“Why that expression? You know it better than anyone.”

Ulrich’s hand touched Lisbell’s face. She flinched at the motion of him cupping her cheek. His thumb pressed down firmly on her soft skin as he lowered his face.

The distance between them became dangerously close, and at that moment, his voice struck down like a sharp blade, disturbingly lighthearted.

“I already own this body.”



“Isn’t it too filthy to be offered to God?”

His delicate fingers touched the center of Lisbell’s collarbones, then traced downward over her clothes, stopping just at the curve of her navel. The long, deliberate line he drew resembled the foundation of a cross. His cunning touch exposed everything she had desperately tried to conceal.

As expected…

There was no way out of this.

Even if she somehow covered up the incident with Sir Philip this time, Ulrich had an absolute weapon.

The truth that Lisbell had no choice but to hide upon joining the monastery. The one thing she had dismissed as nothing but violence—but in reality, it could not be categorized so simply.

Within the confines of this narrow monastery world, what she had done with him was considered a sin. Whether she had consented or not, once a body was tainted, it could never regain its former sanctity.

Even so, having her own corruption defined by his words tore at her heart. Had she wanted it? No. It had all been driven by the man’s base, vile amusement.

“What did you do… to Sir Philip?”

Memories she had buried resurfaced like shattered glass, making it impossible to suppress the question.

Ulrich smiled brightly, as if genuinely delighted that she, who had always avoided and ignored him, was finally speaking to him. The joy in his face was so pure it almost seemed moving.

“Nothing worth calling a crime. I simply proposed a tempting deal for his sick daughter.”



“If he helped me a little, I would arrange for her treatment at the royal hospital in Rekem.”



“You may not know, but Lekem’s medical advancements are far superior to those in this country.”

Of course. A hospital capable of making even corpses appear alive—what couldn’t they do?

Lisbell swallowed the surge of nausea and took slow, steady breaths.

“What… did you make me take yesterday?”

“Yesterday?”

His eyes rolled slightly as if searching his memory. Soon, he let out a soft ‘ah’ and smirked, his eye corners folding lazily.

“A sedative. It happened to be in that mansion.”

Without warning, Ulrich’s hand slipped beneath the hem of her black skirt. His fingers kneaded her knee, making Lisbell recoil inward, trembling. The memory of her retching violently that morning flashed through her mind.

“I needed you to sleep soundly.”



“I wonder if the marks I left are still there…. I sucked on them all night, so my lips are still sore. To be honest, I was so hard it hurt—I almost just put it in, but I don’t really enjoy rushing things.”

As his words dragged on, Lisbell discreetly scanned her surroundings. Though his vulgar remarks made her mind reel and nausea stir again, she endured it, focusing on locating the fallen candlestick she had dropped earlier.

Once she had identified its position, she took advantage of the moment when his attention wavered and swung her foot at him once more.

“……!”

But Ulrich had anticipated this. He effortlessly caught her ankle before her kick could land. Her foot, still clad in its shoe, stopped just beside his cheekbone.

Frustration boiled within her, only for her breath to suddenly catch in her throat.

His gaze bore into her.

His pale blue-gray eyes gleamed, glossy and dark, like glass doused in water. The look he gave her was that of a mischievous delinquent with a particularly wicked thought.

“Disobedient legs…”

Ulrich adjusted his grip on her ankle, making Lisbell thrash, desperately trying to pull away.

But he was faster.

Like a thick, merciless tide, his chilling eyes shone with predatory hunger.

The grip on her ankle tightened. Not just to a threatening degree—but to the point of sheer terror. The sensation sent chills down her spine, and a faint, incoherent sound escaped Lisbell’s lips.

“Ah…?”

“It’s better if you can’t use it.”

Crack. Snap.

Something twisted out of place.

Before the sound even registered, the pain did.

Agonizing, overwhelming pain flooded her senses.

“Aaagh!”

A wretched scream ripped through the air, echoing across the chapel’s walls. Tears burst forth instantly, and her vision wavered. She couldn’t even close her mouth; her entire body shook uncontrollably.

“Hah… haah, agh, aah…!”

Lisbell’s struggling grew more violent, verging on convulsions. Her vision spun and distorted, the sheer intensity of the pain clouding her consciousness. It was unlike anything she had ever experienced.

By the time he finally let go with a touch sickeningly gentle, she collapsed onto the floor, writhing in agony.

“Ugh… haah, ahh….”

Her sobs spilled out in ragged gasps, overtaking even her breath.

She couldn’t tell what had happened to her ankle. She wanted to look, but the very thought terrified her. If she lifted her skirt and saw the damage—if it was so ruined it could never function again—she might break completely. But the pain alone already told her it was that severe.

‘Why….’

Curled up, gasping through the shock, Lisbell stared blankly into the void.

‘Why is this still happening…?’

She had believed it was over.

She had thought, with certainty, that it had ended.

She had convinced herself that he had finally faced reality and put an end to his wretched whims.

What was the sky like that day?

The moment she had felt truly severed from him, the weather had been perfectly clear. The breeze had been light and crisp, brushing against her nose and filling her lungs with a fresh, gentle warmth.

“Hic…”

That was the first time she had realized how peaceful an ordinary day could feel.

She had never fully appreciated how precious normalcy was—how happy it was to bask in the sunlight when she wished, to feel the wind when she desired. She had taken those things for granted, only to have them ripped away.

And just as she fully grasped that the peace she had believed was within reach had now become an unattainable dream—something inside her snapped.

“Why me…?”



“Why, hic, why… why…! Why does it have to be me?!”



“There must be plenty of women looking for you! I’m not the only one—there are dozens, hundreds alone who would line up for you! You could have any one of them! So why… why this fickle obsession, why… why does it have to ruin me? Why won’t you leave me alone? What the hell did I do to deserve this? What crime did I commit to suffer like this…?”

In a one-sided relationship like this, seeking justice was meaningless.

Because it was, by its nature, utterly one-sided.

There was no right answer.

A relationship dictated by someone’s capricious whims—a standard as fleeting and unstable as idle curiosity—was nothing but a vicious cycle of destruction.

And the most terrifying part was the creeping realization that she might be the only one rotting away in this endless spiral.

That thought settled deep in her gut like a heavy stone, filling her with a stark, paralyzing fear. At times, she felt a surge of injustice, only to be swallowed by sheer terror. Anger burned through her, bitter and helpless, as if her very flesh were being torn away.

She sobbed uncontrollably, her gasping cries breaking apart into choked breaths—until suddenly, a hand reached out and cupped her cheek.

Her body jerked violently, as if her very heart had been seized.

“If that’s what you wanted, you shouldn’t have looked at me like that in the first place.”



“You shouldn’t have looked at me with those eyes.”

“Wh… what….”

“I think I might be in love with you.”



“That’s why I came to find you.”

Each word fell with quiet precision, clipped and steady. And at the end of his sentence, Ulrich smiled—like a sunflower turning toward the sun.

Radiant.

Overwhelmingly bright.

And beneath that light, Lisbell felt, with suffocating certainty, that she had truly been abandoned by God.

 If the pain creeping up from her ankle had been even slightly weaker, she might have let out a hollow laugh, unable to resist the numb shock spreading through her entire body.

How was this any different from the ridiculous premise she had once scoffed at in her mind—the one she had declared to her fiancé, Theodore?

‘I must leave him because I love him.’

It was an utterly incomprehensible notion.

And because she couldn’t understand it, everything about it felt grotesque.

“Love…?”

She had once spoken that word to this man’s face. But never in this way.

Back then… it was because he had felt less like a person and more like a slab of ice, something no human warmth could ever melt. Overwhelmed by his cruelty, the word had escaped her lips in a desperate breath.

And what had Ulrich’s reaction been?

He had laughed at her for even mentioning love, as if spitting on the very idea. Then he had forced her onto the table, lifting her skirts with absolute ease, as if crushing her dignity was no more than a passing amusement.

And yet now, that same man spoke of love.

Claimed to love her.

At some point, Lisbell’s tears had stopped falling. She gazed up at him, utterly hollow, as if someone had reached inside her and stolen her soul.

“You…”

Her throat was tight, but she couldn’t even swallow. It felt like staring into something beyond the limits of human comprehension.

“Do you even… remember what you just did to me…?”

“Hm?”

“My ankle… just now… y-you… you broke it….”

Love?

He called this love?

Was what he understood as love something entirely different from what she knew?

The love Lisbell knew was like the first snowfall of winter—pure, clear, and white.

But what he spoke of was something else entirely.

His was suffocating, an all-consuming blackness with no exit, no escape.

White and black. Opposites so extreme that calling them the same was laughable. Suspicion surged inside her, choking her. As she struggled to form the words, Ulrich merely tilted his head with innocent curiosity, then hummed as if in thought.

“Well, you brought this on yourself.”



“I thought you were asking me to break it completely.”

His voice was so smooth, so effortlessly deceitful, that anyone listening without context might actually believe her to be at fault.

Unfortunately for him, Lisbell was not someone so easily fooled. But all she could do was gulp down her horror and stare at him in mute disbelief.

No matter how many times she tried to wrap her head around it, the result remained the same. She couldn’t understand. Her mind moved too slowly, her thoughts lagging behind. All she could do was curl in on herself, desperately trying to retreat from his shadow.

Something moved toward her, blurring in her unsteady vision.

Before she could flinch, Ulrich’s finger traced down her pale cheek.

Wiping away her pitiful tear stains, he glanced at his damp fingertip—then brought it to his lips and licked it.

And smiled.

“Let’s go back to Lekem together.”



“I’ll make you a beautiful bride of spring.”

…A bride?

A spring bride.

No.

No, that wasn’t right.

She had once dreamt of being a bride—but in late summer, not spring.

And that dream had long since vanished, evaporating into nothing before she could even grasp it.

Lisbell no longer wished for such things.

That was why she didn’t immediately realize what was happening—that this man, who called his twisted emotions love, was now uttering words akin to a proposal.

A bride.

His bride.

The bride of this man with those pretty, sickening eyes.

Her head felt like it was about to split open. Or perhaps it was her insides being twisted and wrung dry. The sheer, violent revulsion hit her both physically and emotionally.

She had to get away.

Right now.

With every ounce of strength she could muster, Lisbell forced herself upright, inching backward toward the display case lined with shining candlesticks.

“No….”

She crawled backward on her hands, but even that was difficult.

Any slight movement sent unbearable pain lancing through her ankle, as if her very bones were being shredded apart. Cold sweat drenched her forehead, her back—every inch of her body.

And yet, she moved.

Because if she didn’t—if she stopped—she wouldn’t be able to endure it.

“No… No, no. I don’t want this… I hate it…!”

What had started as a feeble shake of her head escalated into a near-hysterical rejection. She was shaking so hard that she was on the verge of screaming.

Then, a hand seized her hair.

Her head was yanked back by an overwhelming force, and piercingly cold blue eyes bore down on her.

“Why?”



“Why do you hate it?”

His voice held genuine confusion.

“I don’t understand. Shouldn’t you be happy, Lisbell? I’m no longer treating you as a mistress—I’m making you my lawful wife.”



“And just think, how many women in Lorant dream of marrying me? You won. You should be celebrating… shouldn’t you?”

The sheer arrogance in his voice was suffocating, a twisted self-righteousness that dripped with malice. It was as if he truly expected her to weep with joy, overwhelmed by his supposed generosity.

“Celebrate…?”



“You’ve tormented me, humiliated me, crushed me… You even did this to my leg, a-and now you… y-you call this love? And now you expect me to—?!”

“I told you already, you brought this upon yourself.”



“And besides, is it really such a big deal? It’s not like I severed a nerve and left you crippled. Just rest for a few days, and you’ll be fine.”

Ulrich smirked, his gaze laced with condescension. The sheer transparency of his malice sent a chill through her bones. He spoke as if his actions could never be considered cruel, as if he truly believed he was in the right.

“Or wait—”

His grip on her hair tightened.

Her scalp burned as if her skin was being ripped away, her face twisting in agony. Fresh tears spilled down her cheeks.

“Are you still hung up on Theodore?”



“My, my. I didn’t take you for someone so… pathetic, Lisbell.”

He laughed coldly.

Even hearing Theodore’s name come from his lips felt like an unforgivable sin.

Because of this man, she had lost Theodore—her love, her future, everything.

Perhaps this was an even greater insult than the twisted love Ulrich had tried to claim just moments ago.

Lisbell glared at him with seething hatred.

Ulrich only smirked, as if something amusing had crossed his mind.

“Come to think of it… how was your little reunion with your ex-fiance?”

Lisbell’s hands clenched involuntarily.

Ulrich finally released her hair, instead brushing his fingers over the back of her head in a disturbingly gentle gesture. Lowering himself to meet her gaze, he studied her reaction with quiet amusement.

“He’s still the same. Ever the responsible man.”



“Almost… painfully so.”

His words weren’t idle chatter.

There was a deliberate weight behind them, a veiled meaning that sent alarm bells ringing in Lisbell’s mind.

Not just his words—the timing, the phrasing, the way he spoke of responsibility and pity—it was all too deliberate.

And the way he spoke about Theodore… as if he knew him better than she did.

A terrible realization clawed at her mind.

Memories of her visit flooded back, scenes flashing through her head like scattered puzzle pieces.

She had gone there to see Theodore.

And what had she found?

A woman at his side. A woman whose stomach was softly rounded. A woman who did not bother hiding her disdain toward Lisbell.

Jane.

There was no proof.

But instinct took over.

Lisbell’s trembling fingers shot forward, clutching the fabric of Ulrich’s coat.

“What… did you do?”



“What did you do to Theodore?”



“Tell me. Tell me right now!”

“Lisbell, you keep saying such unpleasant things. ‘Did’ something to him?”

Ulrich effortlessly pried her fingers off his coat, leisurely intertwining his own hands before bringing them to his lips.

Then, with mocking gentleness, he pressed a kiss to her bloodless, trembling knuckles.

“All I did was ensure that Motier could settle down with someone new.”



“Since I took his future wife away, well… consider it my way of making amends.”

Lisbell’s lips parted in shock.

Her frozen eyes took in every inch of his face, her mind reeling.

“Are you saying… you sent Jane?”

“Jane?”

He rolled the name around his mouth, as if it was unfamiliar. Then, with a brief chuckle, he mused,

“Ah. She must have changed her name.”

“Actors do that sometimes, you know. They’re so used to playing different roles that they change their names to fit the situation. When we signed the contract, she was Solah Hines.”


Ah, now she finally understood the vague sense of deja vu she felt when facing Jane. It was the same shadow she had occasionally encountered from Julian Scott during her time at the Althahart estate. That inexplicable, shell-like feeling, the sense that something was artificially crafted, had been emanating from Jane.

In other words, Jane was really…

“…Why?”

Lisbell’s stiffened lips trembled with effort. Ulrich, who had been gently biting her fingertips without causing her pain, softly lifted her eyelids, making her gaze meet his.

“Why… are you doing this?”

Why are you… really doing this?

“Why… what does Theo have to do with you…?”

His brows twitched.

Even though she was consumed with anger, there was still a part of her that felt she needed to lash out at his shameless face. Her chest burned with so much heat that her eyes were aching.

“What did Theo ever do to you…?”



“What kind of crime did he commit to deserve this… Why, why…! Why?!”

Tears poured out uncontrollably. It was a storm of sorrow. If her ankle had hurt so much earlier, now her heart ached so badly that it felt like it might break. Perhaps, this single blow was worse than any suffering she had endured so far.

She had worked so hard to keep this misfortune, which she had unknowingly swallowed, from spreading to Theodore. She had endured parting from him, hurting him, and even becoming nothing more than Ulrich’s plaything, all to protect him. Despite all that effort, why did this outcome have to be inevitable?

Why…

Theodore, whom she had met again, at least seemed happier now than when he had been dragging out the broken engagement.

Jane, the woman who had used a false name to approach him, seemed to feel a deep responsibility for him, and she would now work with him to build the stable future they had both dreamed of.

And Ulrich Althahart, that b*stard, had employed this woman to manipulate him.

Wasn’t that a sign that she had ruined Theodore’s life, becoming part of the destruction herself?

No matter how beautiful the relationship might seem, if beneath it all, Jane Hines was only pretending to love Theodore, it was nothing but a lie. It was most likely a contract motivated by money, and in the end, Theodore’s entire life was being toyed with.

Despite deciding to leave him, despite betting everything on it, Theodore’s life had already become tainted. The fact that she, Lisbell, could never be involved with anyone else felt like a curse, and it was impossible to deny that she had become such a horrible person. She couldn’t hide the internal wounds that seemed to be festering deep within her.

The bottled-up resentment was now directed squarely at the true culprit.

Lisbell cried out like a young beast, pushing and hitting at Ulrich’s chest and face with all her might. But her ankle was too painful, and with tears welling up faster than her anger, she collapsed exhausted, her strength drained.

“Ugh…!”

A scream burst from her lips.

The pain in her ankle suddenly intensified, and Ulrich’s hand clamped down on the area, as if to force her to feel it.

Lisbell’s body, leaning against the display case, slid downward. Ulrich grabbed her messy hair and pulled it sharply back. Shards of rainbow-colored stained glass fell wildly, scraping her retina painfully. She winced instinctively.

The voice that followed was soft but, strangely enough, sharp.

“When I confessed, you didn’t shed a single tear.”



“You’re reacting way too strongly to this, don’t you think?”

It was almost as if—although this was an unsettling thought—she was acting jealously. As she muttered in response, Lisbell froze, her breath caught. She had unknowingly grabbed the candleholder that had rolled away earlier. Without thinking, she swung it at the side of Ulrich’s head. The sound of impact was sharp and strong. The sudden blow caused Ulrich’s grip to loosen.

“Huff, hhh…”

Lisbell crawled desperately to escape his hold.

“Ha…! Ack! Ugh…! Hhh…”

But it was no use. Her ankle was caught, and she was dragged back. The pain from the already broken area felt like it was being torn apart again, and Lisbell lay there, her dazed eyes blinking open.

“Ha… Looks like you’ve really turned into a cat while I wasn’t looking. You’re scratching like crazy…”

Ulrich, now on top of her, restraining her with his weight, muttered irritably. Blood trickled down his ear, and as she noticed, the smell of iron-filled blood seemed to hit her all at once.

“Not sure what I should do to make you calm down. Should I find some shackles?”

Even though there was no satisfaction in the physical result, Ulrich seemed completely unaffected. His tone was still that of a gentleman, and he even made it look like he was leisurely searching for non-existent shackles.

A large hand gently covered Lisbell’s eyes. Instinctively, she twisted her body, resisting, but Ulrich clicked his tongue in disapproval.

“Ahh…!”

The hand that had urged her into the darkness released, only to be replaced by his tight grip on her hair, pulling it so hard she thought it might tear. Her tears overflowed, too much for her to shake it off.

Finally, when she managed to unwrinkle her brow, she found Ulrich’s icy blue eyes fixed on the nape of her neck. The harsh, biting gaze sent a chill down her spine.

Soon after, he grinned, and from his charming smile, a terrifying energy seemed to emanate. It reminded her of the moment when he had grabbed her ankle earlier. An unsettling, indescribable unease swelled up in her chest.

The soft sound of fragile glass breaking rang out. A faint, flickering light passed by in the direction of the search. It vanished from the retina, and only then did Lisbell realize it was the flame of a candle burning in the shape of a long teardrop.

“What is it…?”

“Heh, ugh…”

“What’s so inferior about me compared to Theodore?”

The elegant flame tilted, shaped as smoothly as her own figure. Completely absorbed in the heat of the flame, she didn’t even notice the slight oddity in the angle of the object. It was only when—

“…Ugh! Hah!”

A hot sensation rose from her neck. The melted wax dripped and stuck to her skin, causing a mild burn. Even without seeing it, the scar would have been horrific, and once again, she couldn’t touch that spot.

Her delicate body, pinned beneath his solid frame, struggled violently as if fighting against an illness.

What was he doing? Even as Lisbell thrashed wildly, Ulrich easily restrained her, continuing to drop hot wax. Plop Plop. The candle wax, melting with a sizzling sound, fell in long teardrop shapes onto her neck.

The movements filled with resistance slowly died down. Her vision blurred, multiple images stacking before merging into one. It was almost too much—her face first went pale and then turned blue. Cold sweat ran down her temples like tears.

A sharp cough escaped from her mouth as her voice cracked from the strain. Her throat felt like it was turned inside out, and it felt as though her lungs had flipped. After a while, no sound came out at all.

On the brink of losing consciousness, Lisbell scratched the floor with her nails. Her hand trembled uncontrollably for a long while, and finally, Ulrich casually tossed the candle aside.

“Does it hurt?”



“Then why would you make me feel this disappointed…”

She couldn’t tell anymore. Could such a bitter, pitiful voice really be feigned?

There were only two possibilities. Either she no longer had the strength to distinguish between them, or the man had such deeply sincere emotions she couldn’t relate to or understand…

As Ulrich’s hand, now empty of the candle, moved up toward her neck, Lisbell instinctively tensed her waist. She squirmed as if trying to hide from the encroaching darkness, but Ulrich easily stopped her and began peeling the hardened wax off her skin, one by one. He then adjusted her posture to ensure he could see her clearly.

His loose and warm breath brushed over her collarbone.

“It looks like it’ll leave a mark…”

As he said this, Ulrich grinned in a seductively soft tone.

“It’s fine, it’ll look beautiful.”

Ah, only then did Lisbell understand what he intended.

If she had even a bit of strength left to strike, she would have scratched at her throat until her skin necrotized, severing her nerve endings and shattering her bones with her nails, tearing away the suffocating sensations.

The inability to do so was tragic.

It was truly an endless tragedy.


With vacant, rolling eyes, she took in the cross of the church.

It felt entirely different from when she had observed it while seated. Back then, she had been overwhelmed by an aura of mystery, often lost in reverence. But now, seeing it up close, it seemed nothing more than a simple structure, making her former reverence feel foolish.

If God was truly there, was He watching this unfold?

And if so, was He merely standing by, refusing to intervene?

The glimmer of light she had once felt in the tavern by the harbor was fading. The moment she had been certain that divine hands had graced her and granted salvation—one by one, those fragments were shattering into pieces.

So this was how a soul crumbled so hopelessly.

He said something, but she barely heard him. He was speaking of rituals, marriage—something along those lines—but it felt as if he were speaking in an unfamiliar tongue, the words slipping through her mind like mist.

Lisbell merely blinked vacantly. Even as tears blurred her vision repeatedly, she kept staring at the cross-shaped structure before her.

Before long, even the cross faded from view. In its place, the face of a man filled her sight. He had been speaking but now furrowed his brows, perhaps realizing he had been talking to himself all along.

But it was only for a moment. As if it did not bother him in the slightest, he merely chuckled and leaned down to press his lips against hers. Her lips must have been chapped and broken in every possible way, yet he kissed her without hesitation, as if his tolerance for disgust was boundless.

As her lower lip became soaked with his saliva, Lisbell remained dazed.

This man had now blocked her view of God.

Was that why God could no longer see her?

Even in the very end, she did not want to admit that she had been abandoned by the divine. If she did, she felt she would truly be swallowed into an inescapable abyss.

Perhaps… she already had both feet submerged, sinking into its suffocating depths.



She could only tell that she had been asleep for a long time.

The lingering echoes in her faint memories carried different scents. During one moment of consciousness, she detected the sharp scent of medicine. In another, the salty air of the sea. And in yet another, the thick, suffocating stench of smoke.

As if she had traveled far, led only by these unrelated scents. The realization struck her only after she was fully awake.

The insides of her eyelids, which had been shut for so long, felt parched, as though all moisture had been sucked dry. Even with her blurred vision, she instantly recognized where she was.

Because this was the worst place she could possibly be.

The familiar wallpaper and framed pictures, the placement of the table, the precise dimensions of the window frames—every detail was seared into her memory, whether she liked it or not. Everything screamed that she had returned to a living hell.

Lisbell scrambled to rise, thrashing her limbs.

“Ahh—!”

Her frail limbs missed the edge of the bed, and she tumbled to the floor. As she tried to put weight on her ankle, a searing pain shot through her, and a sharp cry tore from her throat.

Her panicked gaze dropped to her right ankle. It was wrapped in layers of bandages, so thick they made it look nearly twice its original size.

Belatedly, she noticed a similar discomfort around her throat. Her fingers trembled as they traced over the wounds. Bruises and injuries covered her body from top to bottom.

She couldn’t believe it.

This wasn’t a nightmare.

It wasn’t some twisted, fleeting vision.

Lisbell tried over and over to rise, desperate to flee this room. But her limbs felt unbearably heavy, and her injured foot refused to cooperate. She couldn’t even stand without grabbing onto something for support.

“Ugh… ngh…”

Just as she gritted her teeth and forced herself upright, her gaze landed on an object she hadn’t noticed before.

A chessboard.

The very same one she had glimpsed before—inside that eerie, cold room, bathed in a pale blue hue.

She knew all chessboards had the same shape, size, and pattern, but the chilling sensation running down her spine whispered otherwise.

This was the same one from Sir Philip’s estate.

No mistake.

She wasn’t imagining things.

And if that was true… then this reality was inescapable.

A creeping panic clawed at her throat, pressing down until all she could think was that she needed to get out of here. Now.

“What are you doing?!”

A voice, filled with shock, suddenly struck her ears.

Lisbell flinched violently, her breath catching as she turned toward the source.

She recognized the man entering the room.

Victor Loisden.

Ulrich’s secretary.

Lisbell’s pupils trembled.

This confirmed it.

If he was here, that meant Ulrich was here.

Which meant… she was back.

Back in the detestable Altahart mansion.

Victor hurried toward her, his voice edged with concern. “You shouldn’t be moving yet! Your right ankle, and your throat—”

“Let go of me!”

Lisbell violently shoved away the hands trying to support her. Victor paused, momentarily startled by her forceful resistance. She clutched the shoulder he had touched and collapsed back onto the floor.

“Why… why am I here?”

“…You’ve been moving around for so long. Now that you’ve finally arrived, you need to rest.”

“This mansion… the Laurent’s estate?”

“Yes.”

Victor, who gave a solemn confirmation, gave up on trying to lift her back onto the bed and instead placed the tray in his hands onto the side table. Lisbell, staring at the door he had entered through, suddenly spoke as if possessed.

“Let me meet with the madam.”

Victor, who had been turning the empty cup and medicine to a more visible position, turned to look at her. Lisbell was too busy hastily spilling out her words.

“I—I made a mistake last time, but I had no choice. I didn’t have enough reason to trust and follow her back then. So if she was deeply offended by what happened before, I can apologize. If she wants me to kneel, I’ll do it willingly. Just please, call her here. Let me meet with her. Or at least relay my words to her…”

“…What do you intend to do by meeting her?”

Victor’s sudden question barely left his lips before he grabbed his forehead with a sigh.

“No, don’t answer that. I didn’t ask because I was genuinely curious.”



“What I mean is… It won’t change anything.”

Lisbell, who had been fixated on the door as if it were her only goal, slowly turned her head toward him. Her bloodshot eyes, ringed with a faint, watery haze, must have been difficult to meet, as Victor averted his gaze this time.

“Ms. Osborne, I don’t know what you’re planning, but if something like this happens again… Honestly, I can’t guarantee what will happen then. This time, it ended like this, but next time, you might get hurt even worse.”



“You should know his nature by now… Once he sets his mind on something, he never backs down.”

As she listened to his words, which were somewhere between persuasion and protest, the moisture in Lisbell’s eyes gradually dried up. Her now dull, murky gaze reflected the cold stillness overtaking her mind.

She had a vague idea of why he was saying this.

Ever since Ulrich had begun his madness, Victor had been unable to completely hide his discomfort whenever they encountered each other. Though he followed his superior’s orders without question, it was clear he found the situation distasteful.

So, this message was likely meant as a warning—to stop making things worse and protect herself.

But to Lisbell, who was lying here in this miserable state, it was nothing more than an infuriatingly complacent remark.

A warning coming from someone who, unlike her, was free to move as he pleased, unrestrained by any chains. A piece of advice to “stay put” from someone who could leave whenever he wanted—no matter how well-intentioned, it was impossible for her to accept without resentment.

“I’ll deal with the consequences. Your moral dilemmas aren’t my concern. If you’re worried about your status or position, you can blame it all on me. Say that I was stubborn, that I threw a tantrum. Just—please, let me see her….”

“That’s what I’m trying to tell you. It’s pointless. The young master convened the last quarterly board meeting and officially removed the madam. He is now the undisputed head of the family.”

Lisbell’s eyes widened in disbelief.

“…What?”

“He is no longer just the young master—he is now the master of this household. The madam no longer has the power to stop him.”

Only now did she realize—Victor’s quiet, careful words weren’t mere persuasion. They were a warning.

A warning to abandon her foolish hopes, because no matter what she did, nothing would change.


“Still… still.”



“Still, there must be some way… there must be… there has to be… there must be, right? Otherwise, what am I supposed to do? Do I really have to become that man’s bride? To hold a wedding I don’t even mean and live my life trapped here?”

“There must be something… a way, somehow, right? There has to be… there must be… or else, what will happen to me? What will I do…!”

Lisbell desperately crawled and clutched his pant leg.

“Th-the monastery. That’s right. I… I officially joined the monastery. I made a vow and registered there! So, what you’re doing… this is kidnapping! It’s an unjust act! If the monastery finds out, they will take immediate action…”

“You left the monastery several days back. By now, you’ve likely been classified as someone who committed a serious crime and disappeared, probably even formally expelled. Even if that’s not the case, I’m sure the young master has already taken care of it.”

Victor answered with a sigh, carefully pulling her hand off of him.

“I’ve brought the medicine, so don’t forget to take it.”



“I hope you recover quickly.”

With that, he left the room without looking back.

Lisbell, who had clung desperately to his pant leg, was now left in the dust, unable to keep up with his pace. Despite her efforts, the door slammed shut, leaving her overwhelmed by a deep sense of failure.

“Hey! Over here… come back! Just once, come back and talk to me again… Hey… Loisden! Hey!”

This time, she couldn’t stay quiet.

How did I escape from here before?

How did I get out of here?

After being dragged here, wounded beyond recognition, she was now being told not to even try to escape. That was like telling Lisbell to bury herself alive.

She desperately wanted to rise, but her body stubbornly refused to cooperate. Lisbell dragged herself to the side table near the door. She grabbed the glass sitting on it and hurled it toward the door.

Crash!

The glass shattered with a sharp sound, pieces scattering across the floor. Some of the larger shards rolled all the way to her knees. Gasping for breath, her chest heaving, she stared at the door.

“Why, why isn’t he coming…?”

No matter how much she waited, there was no response. Lisbell’s eyes, filled with resentment, began to soften as she let go of her frustration.

“Why isn’t he coming? Why, why isn’t anyone coming? Why…!”

Someone, anyone, please come.

Don’t leave me here alone in this space.

Anyone, please get me out of here right now…

“Uhh, uhh… Ahh…”

Lisbell collapsed to the floor, crying as though she had lost all hope. Pressing her face into the damp carpet, she replayed where things had gone wrong. But she still couldn’t pinpoint what had gone wrong. No matter how much she tried to think back, she couldn’t understand what she had done wrong.

One mistake, though, did come to mind.

“You’ve now reached a point where even the mistress can no longer stop him.”

Should she have quietly followed Madam’s wishes back then?

Should she have left for Ducas instead of running away?

If she had, would she have been at peace by now, without worries?

Could she have been free?

It was a pointless reflection. No matter how much she thought about it now, the past couldn’t be undone. Just like she couldn’t erase the journey to Marnia to see her mother, the conflict with the mistress remained the same. Knowing this, tears kept flowing from her chest, as if they were pouring from a deep well.

“Why! Why, again… why, why, why…!”

Hoping that it was all a dream, she slammed her forehead against the floor, but nothing changed. The only thing that spread was the painfully real sensation of physical pain. It was clear it wasn’t a dream. Despair, thick as mud, filled her chest, burning away her mind.

Ah, I…

Yes, I…

I am destined to wither and die in this paradise.

Forever trapped here.

Without anyone ever knowing that fact.

I will fade away, and eventually, I will be nothing but a dying ember, giving up on revival, turning to ash.

A breath, pushed up from her abdomen, flowed through her parted lips. It was so bleak that she had the impulse to crush it all, to destroy everything.

Just like always, she would break alone. After losing her mother, after Theodore’s remaining life was shattered, she too would reach the point where she must abandon herself.

That man, the one who caused all this, would lose nothing at all…

‘…Why?’

It’s unfair, right?

‘Why?’

Why must it be only me who ends up like this?

Her tightly clenched fist trembled for a moment. Raw anger planted a thought in her heart that mirrored the direction she was heading.

Lisbell, who had been motionless, as if she were trapped in a tragedy, slowly began to lift her upper body with sluggish, laborious movements. The sunlight illuminated only a sliver of her face, still calm, even with moisture on her eyes, nose, and lips. Her eyes, though focused, seemed unfocused, not knowing where to look, landing instead on the shards of glass scattered by her knees.

I don’t want this.

I don’t want to die here, withered away.

If I’m going to end like this, if I’m going to refuse to let it end like this…

Her trembling hand grabbed a piece of glass. As she wrapped her palm tightly around it, the sharp edges of the broken glass scraped her skin, drawing blood. The liquid, dark with pain, dripped onto the transparent shards, turning a cruel shade as it mixed with her tears.

Lisbell raised her arm, swinging the shard diagonally. When she slammed it onto the floor, blood burst from her palm in a spurt.

But strangely, it didn’t hurt.

Once, then again, she swung her arm over and over. With each swing, the shard shattered, unable to withstand the impact with the bare floor.

As she opened her palm, the shattered fragments, no longer in their original form, fell to the ground with a soft sound. Her hand was also scratched and bleeding, but the result, though somewhat self-destructive, solidified her resolve like a seed planted deep within her.

The best defense is always an offense.

So, in other words, I must strike Ulrich Altahart first…

Hatred settled into her chest like frost, creeping coldly, filling her. The winter of decay enveloped her. Every corner of her heart became twisted, breaking in ways she could not fix.

Something she had long fought to protect seemed to erode alongside it, but it was okay. She was already in tatters. No matter how much more she was broken here, it would no longer matter.

Her swollen, bruised face slowly turned away.

She saw the mirror adorning the side of the room.

Her messy, tangled short hair, her face drained of color, and her eyes—though still clear—appeared as though they had been ravaged, their imperfections unhealed, decaying.

It was the gaze of someone resigned to their downfall.



The spring sun was gently warming the air.

Her bare skin, exposed to the sunlight, felt prickled, as if it had been pierced by countless thorns. Lisbell, lying with her back turned to the bright window, wiggled her left ankle.

Clink, clink.

The shackles on her barely functional ankle made a stubborn sound as they followed every little movement. She moved her foot like a child playing a game, but there was no playfulness on her face. Her face, devoid of expression, seemed as if someone had drained all its life.

Swish, swish, swish.

The chain connecting the shackles made a scraping sound as it swished through the air, cutting it like a whip. But it still felt better than when it had been around her neck. Though, truthfully, whether one was better than the other seemed a trivial matter.

Perhaps Ulrich had wanted to place it around her neck again, but hadn’t done so, likely because her neck was still healing from the burns.

She didn’t know how long she had been neglected after being burned that day, but every now and then, her bandages oozed with fluid. The new skin was regenerating more slowly than expected, and the healing process was taking longer. Even though her palm, which had been badly treated while clutching shards of glass, seemed nearly healed, it was clear the recovery was slower than anticipated.

“I’ll make you the beautiful bride of spring.”

The realization that those sinful words might be delayed was due to these very injuries.

At the time, she had thought that as soon as he dragged her to Laurent, she might be led directly into the wedding hall. But the fact that he didn’t seemed to indicate that even he recognized how wretched Lisbell’s appearance had become.

Though her swollen ankle might be covered by the wedding dress, the wound on her neck, which was still leaking fluid, would make it impossible to present herself at such a joyous occasion.

Wearing a dress that hid her neck on such a bright spring day would surely invite unwanted stares.

This delay was Lisbell’s only hope.


Swallowing back a groan, Lisbell staggered toward the mirror. Her body was wrapped in bandages from top to bottom, and the one relatively intact foot bore a dark shackle.

Perhaps because shock had its own stages, she barely reacted as she looked at her pitiful state with indifferent eyes. She raised a hand to her bandaged throat and, having done this several times already, skillfully unraveled it. The cloth, damp in places with pus and fluid, unwound and fell away.



The torn and swollen flesh beneath was festering from within, refusing to heal. It was clear that it would take a long time before the wound even began to close.

Lisbell dug her nails into the wound, scratching furiously. There was a reason why even rest and medication did nothing to help her heal. Whenever she was alone in her bedroom, she would touch, prod, and rip at her wounds like someone who had lost their mind. A burning sensation, as if living flames were wrapped around her throat, flared to life.

It hurt. It hurt, and it kept on hurting. In this moment, pain was all she could think about.

“Ugh… Hngh…”

Unable to endure the searing agony, she wobbled before collapsing onto the floor.

Her trembling hands fumbled for something to hold onto before eventually grasping the fallen bandages. Slowly, with unsteady fingers, she began to rewrap them around her throat.

She imagined the moment Ulrich would remove them tonight, his brows knitting together in irritation at the worsening injury. The thought, sharp like a thorny path, brought her the faintest sliver of relief.

She didn’t know how long this method would work, but she had no other choice. She had chosen self-destruction. Ulrich, after all, was the type of man who would drag her to the altar even if her throat was in this state.

Before that happened, she had to—

Clutching the side table for support, she forced herself upright. Like a newborn fawn taking its first steps, Lisbell struggled forward, inching toward the window bathed in the fading afternoon light.

She grasped the curtain and gazed through the clear glass. The barren winter branches had begun to regain their vitality, and the brittle, withered grass was now tinged with a fresh green hue. Buds, prepared for their grand display, painted their tips in shades of yellow, pink, violet, and sky blue, ready to bloom at any moment.

As those flowers patiently embraced the changing seasons, Lisbell, too, thought—thought, and thought again. She reflected on the hatred that had consumed her ever since she lost the two people she had truly loved, after they were ripped away from her.

“I didn’t realize it before, but Lisbell is terrible at acting.”

At the end of her contemplation, she wanted that confident declaration to turn against him, to rip him apart.

Just as he had humiliated her with his deceit, just as he had turned Theodore’s life into nothing more than a cruel stage play, she wanted him trapped in a web of lies, utterly unable to escape.

For that, Lisbell planned to begin a quiet performance with him as the sole audience.

It couldn’t be too sudden, but it also couldn’t be too late.

She would lull Ulrich into complacency and then strike.

Before his patience wore thin and he dragged her to the altar by force.

In this temporary reprieve, Lisbell resolved to wear a tear-stained smile.

With a sharp flick, she pulled the curtains shut and stumbled back to bed, collapsing onto the mattress. She was sure she had closed them properly, yet somewhere, light still leaked through, spilling onto the sheets.

Like a spring rainstorm, the sun’s piercing rays poured in.

It was so blindingly bright that it made something inside her ache.

Curling up, she crawled deeper into the shadows, hiding herself as best she could.



She dreamt of misstepping and plunging straight into a blazing inferno.

The scorching heat climbing up her throat had seeped into her unconscious.

She woke when she felt something cool, like a night breeze, repeatedly stroking her forehead.

The moment she struggled to open her eyes, a hand seized her chin.

“You didn’t take your painkillers, did you?”

It seemed Ulrich had just returned to the mansion, still dressed in his outdoor attire. Lisbell only blinked in response.

That was all he needed to confirm the answer. Without another word, he slid a hand behind her back and forced her to sit up.

It was only when beads of sweat trickled down her temples that she realized a fierce chill had overtaken her body. Her trembling hands clutched at the blanket.

“You probably skipped your meals, too. Let’s start with that.”

Ulrich rose from the bed, likely intending to call for someone.

Lisbell, watching his retreating figure, murmured softly.

“Bring me some alcohol, too.”

“…What?”

He turned back to her, looking as if he had misheard.

Lisbell met his gaze with an unwavering, unreadable expression, pressing her silent request into his mind.

After a pause, Ulrich let out a scoff and shook his head in disbelief.

“You shouldn’t drink on an empty stomach.”

“It hurts.”



“That’s why I just want to drink and fall asleep quickly.”

“You might as well take a sleeping pill instead.”

“I don’t want medicine.”

Ulrich didn’t bother to hide his curiosity.

Ever since he had brought her back from Saint Allante Monastery, she had barely been more than a living corpse. A conversation lasting this long was rare, and it had been even longer since she had insisted on something so stubbornly.

And of all things, she was asking for alcohol—something she usually barely touched.

So she still had some of that strange defiance left in her. Then again, considering she was asking for liquor, she must be in quite a bit of pain.

With a thoughtful hum, Ulrich turned away from the door and instead returned to the bed.

Loosening the tie around his neck, he perched on the edge of the mattress, a meaningful smile tugging at his lips.

“Kiss me.”



“Then I’ll give it to you.”

Their dealings had always been like this. Whenever Lisbell asked for something, Ulrich would demand a price—not anything extravagant, but just enough to make her degrade herself in some way. And he relished the humiliation it brought her, as if savoring a fine delicacy.

“You know how this works, don’t you?”

He stuck out his tongue slightly, gesturing toward it with his finger.

“I only count it as a kiss if you use your tongue.”

He had made such proposals before, but back then, Lisbell’s mother had been held hostage. Now, after an entire season had passed and she had lost everything, she had fallen completely into his grasp.

Given what he knew of her nature, she wouldn’t comply easily.

His anticipation made the side of his head throb—the very spot where she had struck him with a candlestick before. The wound had been stitched up immediately and had since healed without a trace, yet for some reason, it still felt tight and sensitive.

How would she react?

Would she twist her expression like a crumpled piece of paper? Turn her head away in utter disgust? Or maybe she’d clench her fists and charge at him, swinging in futile rage?

Just imagining the possibilities delighted him. The laughter that bubbled up from within was dry yet genuine—proof that he was finally starting to feel the reality of her return.

Lisbell’s gaze was calm.

In the past, she had been unable to hide her revulsion, her irises trembling violently around her pupils. But now, she looked as hollow as the ruins left after a storm had passed. Too still—like the eyes of someone already dead.

Then, she placed a hand on the blanket and crawled forward on the bed.

Was she going to slap him? Shove him away?

He held his ground, not bothering to move.

He had a firm hunch that whatever happened next, it wouldn’t be what he wanted.

“……!”

Which was why, when she leaned in and kissed him without hesitation, Ulrich was genuinely taken aback.

For the first time in his life, something had slipped past his expectations. His senses stood on edge, his perception sharpening as if to make up for the surprise.

His widened steel-blue irises betrayed his shaken composure.

Whenever they shared physical contact, it was usually Ulrich who initiated. But this time, with him frozen in place, their lips simply pressed together, unmoving.

What shocked him even more came next.

Lisbell tilted her head slightly, parting her lips.

At that moment, his tongue lashed out instinctively, invading her mouth without hesitation.

 A sticky sound was heard. Ulrich stirred deeply within, as if he couldn’t breathe without taking from her.

 

Although he had kissed her occasionally while safely bringing her under the influence of sleeping pills, it was definitely different from when she was conscious.

 

The tingling sensation from the friction of their tongues, and the act of touching those now-familiar sensitive spots that drew out sweet moans, naturally led to a sensation so intense it was almost intoxicating. The tingling joy that spread from the friction of their tongues reached the tips of his hands and feet.

 

“Ugh…”

 

Hearing the slightly suppressed moan, Ulrich bit down hard on Lisbell’s lower lip. The pressure released a burst of fluid, like squeezing juice. Her mouth, which had been craving alcohol, overflowed with saliva.

 

Without pausing to catch his breath, Ulrich alternately sucked her upper and lower lips. Every time he circled the roof of her mouth with his tongue, her small mouth twitched and trembled. The tight contraction squeezed his tongue as it was enveloped within. In an instant, he felt an aching heaviness in his lower body.

 

His pen!s, trapped in his pants, throbbed with impatience to be released. Feeling the heavy weight in his groin, he pulled Lisbell’s waist close and lifted her into the air. The change in height broke the connection between their lips, which had been sharing breaths.

 

Ulrich licked the remnants of her saliva from his lips and whispered with a sigh.

 

“Isn’t this the first time?”

 



 

“That you’ve kissed me first.”

 

He had expected her to be difficult, so it was unexpected that things had ended this way, but he didn’t feel bad about it. In fact, the gentle warmth that spread within him was so clear that it made the corners of his mouth lift.

 

It was ridiculous. Such a simple act made him feel like his heart, not his head, had been struck.

 

‘It feels like a first kiss…’

 

The more he thought about it, the more it felt that way.

 

Before, it was obvious when she was forced, but today, it wasn’t particularly noticeable. He thought he should find out why she suddenly became so compliant, but before that, the primal lust that made the veins in his pen!s swell took precedence.

 

Lisbell let out a faint moan. It was the moment when her body, which had been lifted high in the air, was laid back on the bed. However, the moan was swallowed before it could properly escape, as Ulrich immediately followed her and devoured her lips again.

 

Her upper lip was sucked with a force that felt like it would tear. His tongue rudely invaded, tickling her even teeth with its rough taste buds. Their lips met again, sticking together tenderly.

 

“Hngh…”

 

The thin fabric of her slip, which barely concealed her skin, was lifted. As Ulrich continued to kiss her, nibbling and holding her, he gradually moved down. When his platinum hair brushed her neck, he immediately sucked on her nipple.

 

“Ah!”

 

Lisbell arched her back, letting out a nasal sound. Her ashen hair, uneven in length, spread evenly across the sheets. Had Ulrich seen it, he might have been tempted to gather it in his mouth and chew on it, but unfortunately, at that moment, his attention was entirely absorbed by her barely visible nipples under the slip.

 

Despite her flat and modest chest, the small nub was endearingly firm. It was a pleasure to roll it with his tongue and graze it with his teeth until it was slick with saliva.

 

“Ugh, hm…”

 

She let out a suppressed moan. In the bedroom, where the air was dry and chilly, the signs of life finally began to mix in.

 

Ulrich bit down on the slip covering her belly and pulled it up to her neck. Although not overly ample, her breasts had a distinct volume that could properly arouse a man’s lust. They were now exposed to his gaze.

 

Her coral-colored nipples were temptingly erect, inviting attention. Ulrich pressed down on them with his hand, rubbing the slightly indented center.

 

After a moment, he bent down and took the hardened nipple into his mouth, sucking and rolling it while his hand moved downward. His middle finger, slightly bent at the tip, parted the sparse pubic hair and pressed deeply into the tender entrance.

 

“Hah…!”

 

“Hmm.”

 

Their breaths escaped simultaneously, one urgent and the other hesitant. Ulrich pushed his fingers into the dry, stiff flesh and twisted them around. No matter how much he sucked and bit her nipple, there was little change, so he eventually lowered his position.

 

Lisbell’s legs were lifted high into the air.

 

Her right ankle, which had become accustomed to being in a cast due to a complete fracture, and the shackle that clinked with a discordant noise every time it moved, emphasizing its isolation, filled his view. In that state, he forcefully sucked below.

 

“Ugh, ugh… hm.”

 

Ulrich’s tongue, which had been licking around her entrance, traced the fissure inside her groin before slowly entering. He moved his tongue in and out as if he were thrusting his pen!s. The sensation of the soft flesh slipping and sliding inside was intensely peculiar.

 

Every time his tongue brushed the tender parts of the inner walls, it felt like it touched a sensitive spot, making her legs twitch. The chains clattered and swayed with each movement. The sound, like something being thinly sliced, brought a sharp chill to her chest.

 

He adjusted his grip on Lisbell’s ankles. As her legs closed tightly, her labia also plumply closed together. Ulrich buried his nose in between, believing that sweet nectar flowed within. The sound of him greedily slurping echoed loudly in their ears.

 

The foreplay wasn’t long. As he buried his face between her legs, fully intent on devouring her, Ulrich quickly unbuttoned his shirt. Like the violent rhythm of a beast, he shrugged off his shirt roughly, his hand naturally falling to his belt buckle.

 

His pen!s, clean and unblemished, was pulled out. When he stroked it, the pre-cum beading on the head grew thicker. The clear, viscous liquid ran down the side of the cock.

 

It was a clear sign that he wanted to plunge inside her and rub against her until he was fully spent. The smooth, hairless organ soon glistened with a slippery sheen.

 

“Aah…!”

 

He forcefully spread Lisbell’s thighs wide and pressed his flushed, red pen!s head against her twitching entrance. The blunt tip was slightly strained as it pushed into the tight flesh.

 

With a quick thrust of his hips, the shaft sank in halfway. A breath, whose origin was unclear, escaped into the air.

 

“It’s so tight.”

 

“Hngh, ugh…”

 

“Relax a little. Hah, it feels like it’s going to snap.”

 

“Hngh… ah…!”

 

He briefly uttered a sharp word and knelt up. The direction of his buried pen!s changed, and the rounded tip scratched at a strange spot inside. The sensation of being deeply squeezed made Ulrich let out a sharp breath.

 

“Should I c*m once? It might be better to wet it a bit first.”

 

Finding it too tight, he gently grasped the penis half-buried in the dry flesh, stroking it as if to masturbate. He even cupped his densely packed testicles in his palm, squeezing them to encourage ejaculation.

 

Lisbell lowered her eyes deeply. Ulrich, gazing down at her face, which seemed innocent yet fully aware of the impact inside, suddenly began thrusting.

 

Her delicate features instantly crumpled. Seeing her finally react, he wore a sly smile.

 

The thick organ stretched the ridiculously small entrance with sharp thrusts, pushing beyond what seemed manageable. With a skilled twist, he pried open her insides as he straightened his back.

 

The flesh pierced at a sharper angle, forcing open the tight inner walls. The entrance, usually too dry to fully close around him, gradually relaxed as it stretched wider with each thrust.

 

“Hngh… ah…!”

 

Ulrich didn’t miss the opportunity, lowering his licked fingers. Spreading her pubic hair, he pressed firmly on the small nub above her labia, rolling it with his fingers.

 When he directly touched her clitoris, an electrifying pleasure coursed through her belly, making her inner walls throb and tighten around his cock. The thing inside her twitched as if rejoicing at being inside.

 

He followed through by letting a lump of saliva, created by scraping the inside of his cheek with his tongue, drip out.

 

“…Ah…!”

 

Lisbell’s stiff body, which had been rigid like a piece of driftwood washed ashore, gradually loosened up. Ulrich, smiling as if pleased with this, thrust himself in more deeply.

 

The soft spot where the tip of his cock squirmed in felt particularly tender as it slid in. When he repeatedly struck that spot, targeting it, red marks appeared on her pale skin. Each time, as if the pleasure that had taken over her long ago swelled inside, she would tighten her belly in sync with his pounding.

 

“Mm, ah, ah…! Ngh…!”

 

The mixing of his pre-cum and her sticky fluids from the friction of his dick against her inner walls began to create a lewd squelching sound at their joining point.

 

Splish, splash. Now that the inside had finally become slick enough to move smoothly, Ulrich habitually grabbed her ankle and twisted it.

 

“Ah… Aah…!”

 

The coquettish moan that had been flowing from her suddenly turned into a stiff cry. Ulrich, who had tried to change her position to one more comfortable for penetration, unconsciously realized that he had grabbed her broken foot and loosened his grip. A displeased sigh followed.

 

“Because of your leg, this is, ngh, becoming a problem.”

 

“Ah, mm… Ah…”

 

“There’s no position we can do other than this, haah.”

 

Although he grumbled in discontent, his vulgar hip thrusts, twisting her lower body, didn’t stop. As if the only place he could find vitality was inside her, his heated, rigid cock rubbed and ground against her vaginal walls without rest.

 

As he glanced down at the already swollen entrance that had been struck a few times, Ulrich’s lips curled into a sly smile.

 

“I’ll carry you… ngh, should I break your leg a bit more?”

 

His hand slowly moved up her milk-white calf, eventually grabbing her right ankle, which was tightly wrapped in bandages. Lisbell’s gut turned cold as she swallowed down the intense revulsion that surged up, even suppressing her breathing.

 

As the vivid and tumultuous pain of that time when her ankle had been twisted and broken in the dim chapel resurfaced, her vision darkened.

 

As her entire body froze solid, the muscles between her buttocks tightened, clenching around his thick cock. Ulrich let out a wicked moan, squinting one eye in apparent pleasure.

 

“I’m kidding, so relax your hole; you’re too tight. Heh… How adorably scared you are.”

 

Whether it was truly just a nasty joke or not, he casually smiled while his hands roughly repositioned her buttocks on the sheets.

 

“Do you want to spread your legs a little more? I want to go in harder.”

 

Though his tone seemed to coax her, his hand roughly pressed down on her thigh. Lisbell’s lower body spread wide open as if it had become one with the sheets.

 

Taking full advantage of the now accessible entrance, he braced himself on the bedpost and thrust deeply into her slick interior. A sticky heat rose from where they were joined.

 

“Ah, mm, ah…!”

 

As the thick cock plunged into her like an iron hook, rudely battering the passageway leading to her womb, her heart felt like it was being dug out. Lisbell looked up at the man with hazy eyes, at the man who nonchalantly made horrifying jokes that threatened to dull her consciousness.

 

Her gaze did not focus on one point but scattered. Every time she saw him, she also saw her own foot draped over his shoulder.

 

At first, it appeared to be her right foot, wrapped in bandages, but then it seemed like her left foot, shackled to prevent her from leaving this place. Eventually, it became difficult to tell which foot was which.

 

It just felt as if her entire body was being tossed around like a worn-out straw doll. Her insides churned, and a deep nausea, akin to seasickness, welled up.

 

Her wavering gaze soon returned to the man’s face. His sharp features, as meticulously crafted as a jewel, were fully aroused as he took possession of her stiff body, which had become rigid like a shattered fragment.

 

His slightly roughened eyebrows, the wild jawline that tensed occasionally, and the overflowing lust in his eyes were so blatant that anyone could see the lustful residue lingering in them.

 

Not only his face but also the palpable weight of the flesh thrusting endlessly between her thighs conveyed his sexual urge.

 

She had expected this.

 

Lisbell had anticipated that he would be aroused to a certain extent, but now that things had turned out exactly as she had predicted, she felt a slight sense of satisfaction, despite her miserable state. She could now more clearly understand what the man wanted from her.

 

In truth, what Ulrich wanted from her had been clear from the beginning.

 

“If we’re going to have sex, it’s better if we both enjoy it.”

 

“If your fiancé is gone, shouldn’t you be able to enjoy it more freely?”

 

He wanted her to lose her conscience.

 

He wanted her to lose herself, to become one with him, to wriggle in the hellish pleasure.

 

It wasn’t because he was uncomfortable with her trying to live without losing her conscience. He simply had a primal desire to see her fall deeply into depravity.

 

That was his world, after all.

 

The world where he lived, breathed, indulged, and wallowed—a paradise of depravity.

 

Now that she had finally tasted the pleasure of someone acting exactly as she expected, Lisbell quickly realized that to catch him off guard and find a gap, she too would have to cross that boundary. Nothing less would suffice. She had already prepared herself for the fact that he would not be an easy opponent, as she gathered the shattered pieces of her heart.

 

“…Mm?”

 

Lisbell’s hand quietly lifted.

 

As Ulrich, who had been busy thrusting his cock into her with all his might, suddenly stopped his actions.

 

His clear eyes, which seemed to be unable to comprehend the situation, slowly slid toward where she was pointing. At the end of his gaze was Lisbell’s palm, clasped around Ulrich’s collarbone.

 

Lisbell gently caressed the sturdy collarbone that had emerged robustly like a beast’s hide, contrasting with his pale, porcelain-like skin.

 

Although his face was delicate and beautiful, the man’s body was solid and well-toned, like a weapon forged and tempered evenly, with no weak spots.

 

In the next moment, Ulrich’s lips curved into a smooth, almost irresistible smile.

 

Seemingly deeply moved by the fact that her hand was touching some part of him, he displayed an expression as warm as a spring sunbeam, and then immediately seized her hand, bringing it to his cheek.

 

Not stopping there, he tilted his head slightly so that her palm would brush against his lips.

 

It was an affectionate and familiar kiss, starkly contrasting with the scars left by shattered glass shards, where red sorrow and dark blue melancholy swirled and pulsed.

 

When he pulled his lips away with a soft “smack” Lisbell lowered her hand again.

 

As she fiddled with his collarbone, which had grown masculine and prominent like his broad shoulders, she felt his penis stiffen inside her. Twisting her waist slightly in response to the internal stimulation, Lisbell gradually raised her hand.

 

The hand stopped near his nape, where the blood vessels turned a faint blue under the surface, covering the area where his lips had just touched. Motionless, as if she were trying to suppress even her own pulse, she felt the subtle yet strong pulse of life throbbing there.

 

It was faint, yet powerful and vigorous.

 

And therefore, all the more uncomfortable.

 

“What are you doing?”

 

Ulrich, who had paused in their intense coupling to watch her, asked.

 

Lisbell subtly moved her hand, trying to conceal her attempt to feel his pulse. She wrapped her arm around his neck. It was indeed a burden to embrace such thickness. She wondered if she could even tear apart this thick hide with her own hands.

 

“…Ugh!”

 

Suddenly, her pelvis was pressed down as her lower body was struck forcefully. Her entire body trembled, and Lisbell’s eyelids quivered.

 

Whether he was overwhelmed by her unusually assertive behavior today, he spoke in a voice wrapped in both suspicion and undeniable pleasure.

 

“Why are you acting like this today? It’s really, haah, strange.”

 

A man who had no resistance to being touched first by others. It was as if she could feel the pent-up thirst that had made him persistently torment her for so long.

 

On one hand, it was amusing. It was so funny that she was on the verge of sneering.

 

Strange, he says. After treating someone so cruelly, did he think she would be fine? That Lisbell had come this far was all because of him.

 “Ugh, ah, ah…! Ah, hng!”

 

The gentle thrusts that had allowed for brief moments of breath suddenly turned intense. The rhythm was completely abandoned, and the speed increased to the point where breathing became disjointed and erratic.

 

He adjusted his posture so drastically that it was as if he were kneeling upright. Lisbell’s lower body, entwined with the man’s, naturally lifted into the air. Her hips, which were connected to the now-wet slit, and even her waist, lifted off the sheets.

 

Ulrich thrust his penis in forcefully. The relentless movement of his hips made it feel like the walls of her vagina were being scraped. The sensitive inner flesh around the penetrating column was stimulated to the point of almost being peeled back, sending a sharp tingle deep into her abdomen.

 

“Ah…! Mm! Ugh, hng…!”

 

Moreover, each time he entered her, now in a more intimate position, a throbbing heat spread inside her, making her lower region pulse. The inner walls, previously filled with pent-up moisture, now released a blatant spray of fluid outside.

 

It was a violent act of sex, barely disguised by the term “passion.” The pleasure dragged out of her against her will was just that—dragged out.

 

“Hng, mm, mm, ah…!”

 

The inside was hit repeatedly. The vulgar electric current recklessly heated the crown of her head. Her vision whitened, and suddenly, tears burst forth. Her cheeks grew wet as pitiful cries filled the bedroom, almost piercing the ceiling. Her hands and feet trembled uncontrollably.

 

Each time Ulrich’s length filled the narrow cavity completely, Lisbell’s most vulnerable parts tightened as if struck. Of course, Ulrich didn’t allow her to relax, instead digging deeper, almost as if he was seizing her climax.

 

“Hng, mm…! Ah, ah, ah…!”

 

Her moans shortened to the point where they could no longer be any briefer. The heat that threatened to melt her overtook her body, causing it to convulse uncontrollably. The air carried an obscene wave.

 

The man, who had been repeatedly plunging into the flesh that eagerly swallowed him, suddenly drove in with fierce intensity. She felt something wet burst out, soaking her lower region. Between her crossed legs, a thick, lewd scent arose.

 

“Hng…!”

 

As soon as he started to release, Ulrich, now limp over Lisbell’s body, turned his head to the side and muttered something. It was hard to hear, but it seemed like a curse. It was an uncouth word for someone who usually spoke with a deep, aristocratic accent.

 

Perhaps aware of how he was pinning her down with his large frame, he soon propped himself up on the sheets, raising only his upper body. His chest heaved as he tried to catch his breath, and then his hand grabbed her chin. His hot breath, inflamed by arousal, invaded her mouth, wildly swirling around as if to steal away what little air remained.

 

“What is this?”

 

He pulled away from her lips, which had been teasing hers so vigorously that saliva trailed between them, and whispered with a curious tone.

 

“Why do you keep doing these pretty things that don’t suit you…?”

 

The question he had held before the act now finally found voice. He pulled her chin up a bit more.

 

Though he asked, it seemed he wasn’t expecting a proper answer, as he soon left a light bird-like kiss on her lips, lost in thought. When their lips parted, Lisbell whispered in a fragile tone as if she were about to break.

 

“…I want to be at ease.”

 

It seemed Ulrich hadn’t heard her well, as he responded with a drawn-out, “Hmm?”

 

Lisbell fidgeted, curling up under his body.

 

“I… don’t want to hurt anymore.”

 



 

“If I refuse you… you’ll keep hurting me.”

 



 

“So, just….”

 

My throat itches.

 

Unconsciously, she raised her hand to rub the bandage while mumbling.

 

Her tone, dazed and disconnected, passed through her own ears, blending despair and emptiness, as if resigning herself. She hoped that he would perceive it the same way.

 

Ulrich looked down at her in silence. If looks could bore holes, her face would have been pierced by now. He studied her that intensely.

 

Then, he removed her hand from her neck and stood up from the bed.

 

When he returned, still half-naked, wearing only his pants, his lips met hers again. But this time, instead of a tongue, a lukewarm liquid flowed into her mouth. As she swallowed, her throat tingled and burned. The dense scent of liquor filled the air. She finally realized he had given her the drink she had requested.

 

“You’ve made a good decision.”

 

After swallowing nearly a glass’s worth of liquor, all delivered through a kiss, Ulrich’s face finally came into focus.

 

He was smiling. It reminded her of the eerie laughter that had gnawed at her mind, but it quickly vanished like a mirage. Perhaps because his current smile was too gentle to be considered sarcastic. There was a hint of the spring Lisbell had yet to recover in that smile.

 

“There’s a saying that everything depends on how you accept it.”

 



 

“If you stay by my side, you’ll surely be happy.”

 

Though he spoke with a smile, there was an inexplicable murkiness around his pupils.

 

It was the smoke of doubt.

 

For Lisbell to accept his words so easily would require forgetting the desperate resistance she had shown thus far, which he surely remembered vividly.

 

Yet, she couldn’t entirely shake the joy from her expression. It was a reaction she swallowed along with the poisonous doubt. Lisbell thought how truly despicable he was.

 

But then, so was she. The stench of deceit that had only belonged to him now clung to her as well.

 

“Don’t scratch your neck.”

 

She didn’t realize until Ulrich grabbed her hand and pulled it away again. Whether it was itching, hurting, or just feeling tight, she didn’t know. The faint taste of liquor lingered in the breath she swallowed. That was all she could rely on for now.

 



 

The first thing that came to mind as she reoriented her thoughts, lying still as a mouse, was alcohol.

 

It was the burning pain of the scar that intensified each dawn that reminded her, followed by the deep, unshakeable melancholy that left her in a downward spiral, devoid of any will to stir. Finally, she sought it out to endure the nights she would inevitably spend with Ulrich.

 

Since the day she broke off her engagement with Theodore and drained an entire bottle, Lisbell had sworn off alcohol. The breakup was bad enough, but the mistake she made while drunk that day had been shocking. It was a disgraceful secret she vowed never to let anyone know, one that had tormented her for days.

 

“You were the one who clung to me, Lisbell.”

 

“You kissed me first, don’t you remember?”

 

“You wrapped your legs around my waist, begging me not to go.”

 

Lisbell still had no memory of such things. Nor did she want to. The very thought of it was something she would burn from her mind if it surfaced, leaving only unrecognizable ashes behind, ensuring not even a trace remained.

 

But at this moment, she needed the same level of assertiveness she had shown then.

 

Just as she had been so eager to kiss first and touch his body, making him ecstatic in the past, she began drinking again. A glass a day, even if only as an aperitif.

 

At least she had an excuse to rely on. When the skin on her neck had sizzled under hot wax, she had thought she might die, but now it was useful enough to delay the wedding and justify her drinking.

 

The man had been right about one thing: how you interpret and react to something ultimately depends on your own mind.

 

She knew her thoughts were becoming a bit twisted, but it didn’t matter. After all, being docile by his side was something she couldn’t do in her right mind.

 

It was better to spend her days slightly unhinged, rationalizing her self-destructive thoughts, than to be consumed by endless depression.

 

“I want to read a book.”

 

Lisbell, lying on her side like someone whose life’s posture was laziness, suddenly spoke.

 

The man, who had been fiddling with his cufflinks, looked her way. Sunlight streamed through the window, licking at his body as if in adoration.

 

When he turned his body toward her, his lips curled into a subtle smile. The tender spring light fell on him, exuding an infinite gentleness.

 

“Do you want to spread your legs so I can see?”

 

But contrary to his gentle demeanor, his open mouth issued a crude command as if crafted from vulgarity.

 It was a good idea to have a drink in the morning.

 

Lisbell thought this as she hiked up the slip that only covered half of her thighs. She knew that spreading her legs while the slip was still in place wouldn’t show her what she wanted to see. In the end, he was a man who would push her to vulgar acts to get what he wanted.

 

The flimsy slip slid upward, revealing her hips and the rounded curve of her buttocks. As he approached the bed, she spread her legs to give him a better view. She could feel his ocean-blue eyes roving over her exposed skin.

 

Ulrich’s hand, which had been adjusting his sleeve, dropped, and a stifled breath escaped his lips. With a self-deprecating smile, as if mocking himself for falling into temptation, he crawled between Lisbell’s slender thighs.

 

His slippery tongue licked the still-swollen entrance, the aftermath of last night’s activities. His thorough, persistent licking made her twitch involuntarily.

 

It was revolting how accustomed to pleasure even humans could become. The inside of her stomach began to heat up, and though she felt slightly nauseated, she could manage. The drink she had in the morning helped her maintain her composure, even as she felt herself sinking lower.

 

Ulrich, who had been touching nothing but her tongue, suddenly grasped her knees, spreading them wider. His grip reminded her of his arousal, which was already evident.

 

The sound of his tongue flicking between her legs was unrelenting. Each time he moved his head, his fine platinum hair tickled the sensitive skin of her inner thighs. While the man indulged in her, Lisbell gazed at the ceiling, her mind hazy and unfocused.

 

“You made a good decision.”

 

After that remark, Ulrich’s suspicion persisted steadily from that day onward. He constantly tried to gauge if Lisbell had truly abandoned the hope that lay outside and accepted the tragedy that surrounded her.

 

The routine was always the same.

 

Lisbell would make a demand, and he would propose something in return.

 

Just like when she asked for a drink, Lisbell began to make requests of him, one by one.

 

From specific requests like “I want to bathe alone,” “I want to open the windows whenever I want,” to more meaningless and capricious demands like “I’m bored,” “I’m hungry,” “I’m cold,” she threw out anything that came to mind.

 

Each time, Ulrich would naturally expect something in return—usually something involving her body. Yesterday, she had sucked him off while lying on the bed, and the day before that, they had kissed until her tongue was sore.

 

Of course, Ulrich never stopped at mere teasing.

 

“I’d like to hold the wedding at our hotel. I plan to decorate the banquet hall with sweet peas that will be in full bloom before summer. They’re pink, just like your insides, so you’ll love them.”

 

Sometimes he would bring up the wedding.

 

“By the way, did you have a good conversation with Mr. Mortier? How was he? Did he seem happy with Ms. Hinse?”

 

At other times, he would mention Theodore.

 

Lisbell always remained calm, occasionally adding a “Yes” or “No.”

 

Whenever she responded like that, Ulrich would stare at her, as if trying to dissect her reaction. Though he often smiled, there was always a sharp intensity in his eyes. He seemed desperate to keep testing her.

 

“…Ugh, mm…”

 

Her legs lost all strength. Ulrich, who had buried his tongue deep inside her and was rolling it around until her insides became mushy, finally lifted his head when his lips were thoroughly soaked.

 

“What book?”

 

Seemingly satisfied with his morning activity, Ulrich asked pleasantly, his voice still playful. As Lisbell licked her lips, trying to shake off the tingling sensation between her legs, she answered.

 

“I’d like to choose it myself…”

 

Ulrich, who had been licking her lips, paused.

 

His once indifferent gaze now hardened into a cold stare. He then gave her a smile that was clearly superficial. That’s right, his expression seemed to say, I should have expected this.

 

“Do you want to leave the bedroom?”

 

To the man, that’s what her main intention must have sounded like. Lisbell looked at Ulrich without bothering to pull down her slip, then slowly turned her body away. She lay down, turning her back to him, and muttered indifferently.

 

“Never mind if it’s not allowed.”

 

Ulrich didn’t respond. However, she could feel his icy gaze raking across her back. Lisbell stared blankly at the wall, as if nothing could change her mind.

 

Before long, a shallow sigh broke the silence.

 

“…Ha.”

 



 

“This is just as nerve-wracking.”

 

Her body was suddenly pulled to the edge of the bed. Ulrich had tugged on the chains connected to the bedpost. The sensation of being dragged against her will was always unpleasant and unnerving.

 

By the time she blinked, she found herself pinned beneath him. Ulrich lowered his upper body and bit one of her round buttocks hard. The feel of his teeth sinking into her soft flesh sent chills down her spine.

 

“Well, since you’ve so generously spread those expensive legs…”

 

He spoke as if doing her a favor, and shortly after, he called someone in to bring the shackle key. He must have been too lazy to dress her, as he draped his house robe over her slip-clad body, then swiftly unlocked the shackles.

 

As soon as he finished, Lisbell’s body was lifted into the air.

 

“I’ll carry you instead.”

 



 

“If you don’t want that, we can forget about it.”

 

He raised his eyebrows with a playful smile. It was clear he was eager to see how she would react.

 

Lisbell stared at him closely before slowly moving her arms.

 

Ulrich’s smile quickly faded. When the woman’s thin arms, as fragile as tree branches, wrapped tightly around his neck, he nearly dropped her but quickly regained his composure and adjusted his grip on her.

 

At the same time, he let out a faint chuckle.

 

“…See?”

 

The hand supporting Lisbell’s back pulled her closer into his embrace.

 

“I feel like I’ve never won.”

 

Muttering to himself in self-mockery, Ulrich shook his head slightly as he walked toward the door.

 

Honestly, until they were walking down the corridor toward the library, she wasn’t sure how sincere he would be. She assumed he’d pick out a few books, give instructions to the servants to bring them to the bedroom, and that would be the end of her unexpected outing.

 

But the man surprisingly invested his time with genuine sincerity.

 

He looked over each of the two-story-high shelves, allowing Lisbell to choose the books she wanted. He even recommended some, mentioning they were enjoyable reads. When Lisbell examined the books he handed her, he seemed pleased, rubbing his lips against her temple as if it felt rewarding to have her attention.

 

At one point, Victor entered the library. He seemed to be there to discuss some schedule, but Ulrich dismissed him with an unrecognizable gesture, letting Lisbell continue her leisurely book selection.

 

It was while she was aimlessly wandering through the library, enveloped in Ulrich’s arms, that something caught her eye.

 



 

It was a chessboard set up on a library table. The square grid, square pieces, square layout—everything about it was geometric. The moment she saw the object full of angles, a shiver ran down her back.

 

“Hmm?”

 

Ulrich, noticing that her attention was elsewhere, followed her gaze to the chessboard and asked.

 

“Curious?”

 

As if in a trance, she nodded. Ulrich left the bookshelves and approached the library table.

 

“Have you ever played?”

 

“No.”

 

“Shall I teach you? It’s worth trying.”

 

Ulrich whispered as he toyed with the king piece, moving it to incorrect squares. Lisbell hesitated before slowly lowering her hand. Seeing that she couldn’t reach the chessboard from where she was, Ulrich bent his knees to let her touch it.

 

The cool edge of the square brushed against Lisbell’s fingertips.

 

No.

 

It was too blunt.

 

It was far too dull to pierce the strong, calloused flesh she had once covered with her palm. It seemed sharper from a distance, but it wouldn’t do. The size was also too large for her to wield with one hand. A book corner would be better than this.

 

“…Alright.”

 

Ulrich responded with a soft laugh to her seemingly absent-minded reply.

 When she returned from exploring the library in the morning, the bedroom was filled with sunlight.

 

He naturally found the shackles and attached them to her ankles after laying her down on the bed. Lisbell opened the book she had brought with her, as if his behavior was expected, without frowning once.

 

Ulrich, who stood close by, watched her with a curious gaze. After a moment, he heard someone calling him from outside the door. Ulrich slowly lowered himself and brushed his lips against Lisbell’s shackled instep.

 

“What could it be….”

 



 

“I wonder what’s going on in that little head of yours.”

 

Muttering as if he was genuinely confused, he announced that he’d be right back and planted a kiss on the side of Lisbell’s head before leaving the bedroom. Even at the sound of the door closing, Lisbell didn’t move as she continued reading her book.

 

After several pages, she gently lowered her head.

 

The shackles that had vanished just moments before were now securely fastened, as if by magic. The most tangible proof that her freedom was in his hands.

 

Lisbell shook her shackled foot as if out of habit. The sound of the chain rattling against the edge of the bed was like the crack of a whip.

 

Clank, clank, clank.

 

Clank, clank….

 

The sound ceased, and the ominous vibrations that had echoed through the bedroom subsided.

 

Lisbell lay still as if dead, determined.

 

First, she needed to remove these shackles.

 

Only then did it seem possible to get what she wanted.

 



 

The days passed in leisurely succession.

 

For the man, certainly. But for Lisbell, the days were far from carefree.

 

“…It’s your turn.”

 

Lisbell’s voice, slightly breathless, echoed after moving the white bishop.

 

“Huh? Oh.”

 

Ulrich seemed oblivious to the fact that they were playing chess, preoccupied with toying with Lisbell’s body, which was seated on his lap.

 

Even now, his hands were slipping inside her slip, crudely fondling her flat chest. Her breasts, squeezed repeatedly, were tender, and her nipples, pinched and rolled like toys, had become stiff and protruded through the slip in an obscene manner.

 

It wasn’t until Lisbell’s voice reminded him that it was his turn that his hands withdrew from inside her slip, grasping the black knight. Without hesitation, he made a bold move that quickly overwhelmed the board, easily bypassing the pieces Lisbell had set up.

 

Since returning from the library in his arms, a chessboard had appeared in the bedroom. Ulrich wasn’t much of a teacher. Whenever he tried to explain the rules, he’d take every opportunity to touch her somewhere, and when he was particularly aroused, he’d push the chessboard aside and bury himself between her legs.

 

As a result, it took three days just to learn the basic rules.

 

What started as a simple pastime increasingly puzzled Lisbell.

 

At first, as an inexperienced beginner, losing was only natural. But even as she gradually learned the game, the results remained the same.

 

Even when she thought she had come up with a clever move or a suitable variation, Ulrich would make a single gesture, and all her strategies would crumble, the entire board collapsing in an instant.

 

It was incomprehensible how he managed to win despite his lack of focus, constantly groping or sucking on parts of her body while they played, without any apparent interest in the game. The reason she continued to play chess, despite planning to quit out of frustration, lay in that mystery.

 

A few turns passed. Eventually, Lisbell’s white king was surrounded by his pieces. Checkmate. She was thoroughly defeated. Though it was just a game, her heart sank. The feeling of something breaking inside her, already fragile, was overwhelming.

 

“…Why?”

 

The question slipped out.

 

Ulrich, who had achieved victory with indifferent ease, let out a casual breath as he bit her earlobe.

 

He chuckled softly, as if he had already guessed what was on her mind. His hand, which had slipped between her thighs without her noticing, slowly withdrew and approached the chessboard.

 

“Lisbell, your moves are too predictable.”

 



 

“I can read them after just a glance.”

 

He licked her ear, adding, “Well, that’s part of your charm.” Ulrich’s comment was not something Lisbell particularly cared about. She watched as his hand touched her fallen king.

 

“And you’re too conservative.”

 

His touch was light, driven purely by base curiosity, just as when he toyed with her.

 

“You’re too hesitant to bring your king to the front lines.”

 



 

“It’s obvious how you try to protect and hide what’s precious to you.”

 

Hide the king?

 

Lisbell looked at the chessboard again. Indeed, while her king had barely moved from its starting position, Ulrich’s king had ventured dangerously close to the heart of enemy territory. It was more of an offensive move than one aimed at ensuring safety.

 

“If you want to win.”

 

He knocked over Lisbell’s king. Then, he picked up his own dark king, moving it a square or two to occupy the spot where her king had been.

 

“You have to be bold.”

 



 

“Victory belongs to those who take risks.”

 

It was as if he were coaxing her. Lisbell straightened her fallen king. She remembered a rule she had learned on the first day: the king is the only piece in chess that cannot be captured. When a checkmate occurs, the player declares defeat and topples their own piece.

 

She hadn’t declared defeat, yet her king had fallen. It was as if the fallen king mirrored her own crumbling self, and she couldn’t just leave it lying there.

 

After playing a few more rounds with Ulrich, they were interrupted by a phone call. Lisbell, now seated properly in a chair after getting off his lap, continued moving the pieces, even though her opponent was gone.

 

At one point, her hand slid off the board, and she felt along its edge. Her gaze soon shifted to the glass on the side table, placed there earlier for amusement. She imagined throwing it to the floor, shattering it. She even imagined picking up the sharp shards. The sensation of her healed palms stinging as the wounds reopened was almost palpable.

 

‘…No, that won’t do.’

 

It’s not enough.

 

She quietly moved her hand back, positioning the rook at the edge, lost in thought. When Ulrich returned after a surprisingly long absence, possibly due to an extended meeting, he was startled to find her still sitting by the chessboard, diligently playing.

 

He approached with a wry smile, as if to say she was hopeless.

 

“Is it really that fun?”

 



 

“Should’ve told you sooner.”

 

The chair turned toward him so he could see the chessboard. He lifted her off the chair, his thick arms making it clear that even if she stabbed him with the broken glass, he probably wouldn’t even bleed.

 

“No matter how fun it is, it shouldn’t be more fun than playing with me.”

 

Whenever they played chess, she couldn’t escape a feeling of crushing shame.

 

What am I doing?

 

Is this really the time?

 

I should be finding a way to … as soon as possible.

 

But then, when she saw how Ulrich enjoyed himself without hiding his pleasure, she couldn’t help but think it wasn’t a bad decision after all.

 

After all, her cooperation surely bred a subtle, insidious complacency within him. Just as she had sneaked into enemy territory and surrounded his king without his knowing.

 

Bold and daring, he had said.

 

As Lisbell was moved from the chair to the bed, his words floated through her mind. The chains of the shackles rattled as they stretched far and then wound back to the bed, making a chilling noise. It sounded like a snake slithering through the dark grass towards her feet.

 

“Otherwise, I’d be so disappointed….”

 

His voice poured over her like the afternoon sunlight, lazy and content.

 

Without needing to say much, she could tell that he was thoroughly satisfied with their current life.

 

As she considered how he filled his days with deep satisfaction, her nape began to itch. Lisbell closed her eyes tightly. Her heart pounded lightly. She recalled the sharp pain still lingering in her palms. She remembered the hot blood that had flowed from the open wounds.

 

It didn’t matter if she failed at chess.

 

Winning or losing in such games wasn’t what mattered to her.

 

If she could be bold in reality, if she could achieve what she wanted, then she would ultimately win. She had to endure, to be patient, for that one goal alone.

“Lisbell, wake up now.”

Her temples were gently pressed. Even in her faint consciousness, she could guess that it was the man’s lips.

It was the first time he had woken her since she had returned to this bedroom.

Given that rest was necessary for her injury, and knowing that staying awake would only bring more fatigue, he never attempted to wake her up in the mornings when she wasn’t ready to get up.

So, this morning felt a little special.

Still half-asleep, Lisbell sat up, and Ulrich, already neatly dressed as if ready to go out, swept his tousled hair away with his hand. He kissed her forehead gently and smiled faintly.

“Shall we have breakfast first?”

At first, Lisbell wondered why he had woken her up, but it seemed to be just to have breakfast. He brushed his hand through her hair once more, and she got up from the bed.

Without thinking, she placed her weight on her injured foot and stopped in surprise.

She hadn’t realized it, but the pain in her broken foot had become much weaker. In fact, it was almost completely gone. Before, even the slightest touch would send a sharp, grinding pain through her bones, but now, she could stand perfectly fine on that foot.

“Is your foot all healed?”

Ulrich asked as he reached out his arm to help her but paused mid-motion. Lisbell nodded and sat in the chair he had set out for her.

There was only one serving prepared on the table. She had assumed he woke her up to join him for breakfast, but it seemed that wasn’t the case. She felt puzzled but didn’t ask and picked up the cutlery.

Ulrich lowered himself to sit in front of her chair. Lisbell, breaking off a piece of the crispy crumpet, glanced down. It was clear that the swelling had gone down a lot. Satisfied with his observation, he didn’t re-wrap the bandage but simply placed it aside.

She expected him to stop there, but his hands moved toward her other ankle—the one that had no injury, but still bore the weight of a manacle.

His touch on her uninjured ankle felt awkward. Lisbell mechanically chewed her food, as if suppressing the discomfort.

Her chewing slowed, and a few moments later, the tension in her ankle was released. The tightness eased, and the sense of weight on her ankle vanished, leaving an odd emptiness.

She had been freed from the manacle a few times before. After she had asked to go to the library, Ulrich often removed it when she requested, and he would carry her there in his arms. She didn’t need to think too deeply about this.

Yet, today, something felt different. Ulrich had removed the manacle without any request from her. It was unusual.



As she continued to stare blankly at the floor, Ulrich flicked her nose lightly. That snapped her back to attention, and she slowly resumed eating.

After breakfast, it was as if it was already planned—she was placed in the bathtub. The warm water wrapped around her, lifting her spirits.

Ulrich hummed softly as he washed her, carefully avoiding her neck, which had suffered burns. He washed her limbs, armpits, and every part of her body with great attention, ensuring no spot was missed.

Lisbell, sitting in the water, absentmindedly shook her left ankle, still feeling the strange lightness. The sound of her foot brushing in the water was oddly clear, and the same sound seemed to echo in her mind.

Even after stepping out of the water, she kept shaking her foot. Ulrich chuckled at her actions, straightening his back and bringing a towel from the rack to gently dry her hair.

“The weather’s warmed up a bit, so a blouse and skirt should be fine, right?”

After the bath, it was time to get dressed.

Ulrich moved toward the wardrobe and pulled out several outfits he had already picked out, handing them to her. Although she wasn’t sure of his intentions, Lisbell had no choice but to pick one of the outfits he had chosen.

Once she was dressed, Ulrich led her toward the bedroom door.

“Shall we go?”

He opened the door and spoke.

Where to?

She was burning with the urge to ask, but she held back. An odd tension tightened in her chest. She had a feeling that if she was to make sense of the strange chaos of this morning, she would have to quietly follow Ulrich without asking.

As she walked behind him, her mind drifted.

Is it really right that I’m walking on my own two feet? Could it be that the unbelievable part is my own condition, or the position I’m in? Is it strange that I’m walking normally now, without the manacle or injury? Or is it simply strange that I’m walking through the corridors of this mansion in such a normal state? It was hard to distinguish which one felt more surreal.

She looked at Ulrich’s back ahead of her.

His back, wrapped in a thin shirt for spring, looked so strong that even if she tried to run and leap onto him, it wouldn’t break. The sight made her feel as though her blood had drained and her whole body had wilted, as though standing before an endless desert.

A moment later, Ulrich opened a door to what appeared to be a reception room.

The first thing Lisbell noticed was a clothing rack filled with dresses, tightly packed and seemingly all the same type.

They were all white, with simple frills and lace—delicate but not excessive.

Lisbell’s feet stopped, unable to go any further.

“You’re a little late, Madam. I’m sorry to have kept you waiting.”

The woman standing in front of the clothing rack, giving instructions to an assistant who seemed to be a subordinate, turned toward them with a lively face. She was probably the madam of the tailor shop, invited here by Ulrich.

“You don’t need to apologize. I was so excited and thrilled that I lost track of time waiting,” she said with a bright smile.

Ulrich, smiling as if relieved, looked over at Lisbell, who was still standing by the door. He reached out and gently pulled her forward. Lisbell hesitated but followed, unable to tear her eyes away from the dresses hanging on the rack.

In contrast, the madam’s gaze remained fixed on Lisbell, and she couldn’t seem to look away.

“Oh my, could this be…?”

The madam’s anticipation grew, and Ulrich answered with a soft smile.

“This is my fiancée.”

The madam’s smile deepened. She extended a business card, the size of a palm, and greeted them.

“How do you do? I’m Yvonne, the madam of Rettoile Tailoring. I’ve been looking forward to meeting you ever since I received the request from Mr. Altahart.”

“A request…?”

“Yes. It was a request to make the wedding dress for your wedding.”

Yvonne, with a pleased smile, looked at the two of them, seemingly pleased with how well they matched. Ulrich smiled back. In the meantime, Lisbell could not bring herself to smile.

She didn’t even consider looking at the business card in her hand and kept glancing over at the dresses on the rack.

As expected.

They were all wedding dresses.

“Shall we begin?”

While Lisbell was lost in thought, Yvonne asked Ulrich, turning toward him. Ulrich gestured as though to confirm, then walked over to a sofa in the reception room and sat down. Shortly after, a servant entered and handed him a glass of wine.

“I’ve selected several styles as samples, would you like to pick one, Miss?”

Yvonne kindly spoke to Lisbell, who was still standing stiffly in front of the rack.

Lisbell was filled with a burning desire to crumple the business card in her hand and set fire to the wedding dresses on the rack. But she knew she couldn’t do that.

She had… been pressured countless times already.

By his tongue and its tests.

This was likely just another one of them. If she caused a scene here, everything she had painstakingly achieved, enduring the peeling away of her heart’s shell little by little, would be for nothing.

In a way, this wasn’t entirely bad news. The fact that he was expanding the test like this meant that his heart was also stirred. In other words, he was getting closer to truly being affected. If things continued this way, it seemed that he might easily be deceived by her—she might even end up believing him, which was a dangerous game she had to play carefully.

“Don’t want… don’t want, I don’t want it… no…!”

She vividly remembered how she had screamed and recoiled from his proposal.

If he wanted this, then she had to go along with it.

That way, she would be closer to her goal too. Shaking off the loathing and scorn crawling up from her toes, Lisbell grabbed one of the wedding dresses on the rack.

 “Did you say the flowers to be used as decoration will be sweet peas?”

Yvonne asked Ulrich, who was sitting on the sofa, leisurely swirling a crystal glass with ice in it. Ulrich nodded. Yvonne carefully selected several dresses from the rack. Several flowing dresses were then thrust in front of Lisbell, who stood like a mannequin in front of the mirror.

“Since your skin is so fair, I think these colors might look nice on you.”

“Still, it should at least look like a wedding dress, right?”

“Do you prefer something even whiter than this? Understood.”

Although Lisbell was the one to wear the dress, the exchange of opinions was solely between Yvonne and Ulrich. It couldn’t be helped, since Lisbell had been confined to the bedroom and had no knowledge about the venue, the flowers, decorations, or anything else related to the wedding.

Yvonne also seemed to have received some kind of hint, as she directed most of her questions toward Ulrich. At first, Lisbell had been uncertain, but when Yvonne glanced at her neck in the mirror—specifically the bandaged area from her burn—it became clear to her what was going on.

Of course, they didn’t completely disregard the doctor. Whenever Lisbell seemed to lose herself mentally, Ulrich would pull her back into reality by gently starting a conversation.

“What do you think, Lisbell?”

“…I like it.”

“Which one?”

“The one I’m wearing right now.”

“You said you liked the one you tried on earlier.”

“They’re all so beautiful, I can’t choose.”

Through the large full-length mirror, Lisbell occasionally met Ulrich’s gaze. Every time their eyes met, he would pause, holding his glass to his lips, and flash a small, almost amused smile.

Can you really endure this?

Can you really stand here, choosing a dress to walk down the aisle with me?

You want to feel comfortable, don’t you? That’s a lie, isn’t it?

This is all just an act, isn’t it?

Come on, show your true self.

Go back to when you were screaming that you hated me, that you were disgusted.

Expose all the hidden thoughts you’ve been keeping inside.

The beautiful and grotesque pale blue gaze directed at her seemed to pour out such temptations. Lisbell deliberately did not avoid his eyes and steadfastly put on the dress. The subtle applique decorations on the dress swirled around the hem, making it look like a living flower.

Ulrich behind her let out a low exhale.

“Hmm… Madam?”

Yvonne, who had been carefully unrolling the train of the dress, turned toward him. Ulrich, sitting with his legs crossed, leisurely swirled his glass while offering an awkward smile.

“I’m afraid it’s going to be difficult for me to step out for a moment.”

“Do you have an urgent matter?”

“Well, it’s somewhat urgent…”

His hand, not holding the glass, reached down to rest on his knee and gently stroked it. There was something strangely intimate about the touch. Yvonne, who had been watching, quickly realized his intentions. Once she understood, it seemed rather blunt.

“Oh, my.”

She, a seasoned professional, seemed flustered for the first time in such a situation. Her smile, which had been unshaken despite Lisbell’s indifferent attitude, wavered for the first time.

“It seems you really like this dress.”

“Seems so, since I want to be alone with her right now.”

The smoothness of his voice contrasted with the shocking content of the conversation, leaving Yvonne at a loss as to how to respond.

Knock.

There was a knock on the door.

The door opened, and Viktor appeared.

“Sorry to interrupt. Sir, there’s something urgent…?”

Viktor, with no intention of further conversation, immediately approached Ulrich.

Ulrich, seemingly disappointed, took a sip of his drink and set the glass down before standing up. As expected, his pants bulged awkwardly. Despite that, his face remained remarkably calm.

Approaching the door, Ulrich briefly listened to Viktor’s message, then turned to look at Yvonne.

“Looks like I need to step out for a moment. I’ll be back soon, so please take care of things in the meantime, Madam.”

“Yes, don’t worry.”

Ulrich left with Viktor, and the situation came to a close. Just the absence of the man’s gaze made Lisbell feel a lot more at ease.

Unlike earlier, when she could hardly breathe, she was able to relax a little now.

Yvonne began explaining the dresses that Lisbell hadn’t yet tried on, showing them one by one. Lisbell half-listened, her attention wandering around the room. She was cautious not to let on that she was wondering whether Yvonne had received some kind of hint. Fortunately, Yvonne seemed to remain focused on the clothing.

As Yvonne was organizing the back of the dress that Lisbell had just tried on, she let out a short exclamation.

“Oh dear, I completely forgot about the veil.”

“The veil?”

“Yes. A wedding dress isn’t complete without considering the veil. I’ll go get it right now, so would you mind waiting just a moment?”

“Ah… yes.”

If she could leave the room too, it would be a welcome relief for Lisbell. Yvonne asked for permission and hurriedly opened the door and left.

Now alone, Lisbell, in her stunning dress, began to inspect every corner of the reception room. Not stopping there, she also looked over the rack she had just stood near and the tools that Yvonne had been busy handling. She was searching for things like pins attached to the clothes or scissors used by the madams to cut threads. But none of it satisfied her. They were all less than worthless—mere shattered pieces of glass.

‘No… something else…’

Just as her thoughts were starting to deepen, a sudden silence disturbed her.

Only moments ago, there had been the soft rustle of fabric, laughter, and the hum of voices filling the space. Now, it was as if the room had been washed clean by water, leaving an eerie quiet.

When she realized what had happened, she understood.

She was the only one left in the reception room.

At that moment, the injury to one of her ankles had fully healed, and the shackles that had bound her other ankle were removed.



Her violet eyes, which had been dim under dark clouds like violets in the shade, suddenly surged, trembling. Her gaze, carrying the tremors of her inner turmoil, slowly turned toward the door.

The door was closed.

But it could be opened.

She was no longer in the state where she couldn’t walk alone, and she wasn’t physically held back by shackles either. Both the man and the madam who had been attending to her were gone.

Recalling the days when she had freely roamed the mansion, the hallways were always quiet. Few people passed by, and there were plenty of hiding places.

So if she was careful…

‘Escape…’

Could she do it?

The realization struck her mind like a collision, and every cell in her body screamed in excitement.

Run. Escape. Get away. Go far.

The rejection that soaked her chest was raw and vivid. Her thoughts, trying to roll forward smoothly, were blocked. She just wanted to take the opportunity to distance herself from Ulrich, to find a way to get away from him. She longed to drink in that desire to the point of intoxication.

From that man’s side…

Once more…

Her two feet, covered in the white dress, moved toward the door. The tension she had barely suppressed shot up again, and her lower abdomen chilled.

When she grasped the doorknob, a flash of pale blue light suddenly shone in her mind. In the darkness, in the light, under the ceiling, those arrogant eyes had been looking down at her.

Lisbell opened the door with a sudden motion.

“….”

The regret came instantaneously.

What if this was some kind of trap set by him? What if he had someone stationed outside the door, watching to see how she would react? What if he had planned to watch her and see what she would do next? How could she have been so reckless?

Before she even realized it, her breath had become ragged. Lisbell, barely able to make a sound that no one else could hear, turned her stiff neck from side to side.

No one… was there.

There was no sign of anyone waiting to watch her leave. No matter how long she waited, she couldn’t hear a single sound. It was just eerily quiet, like a scene from everyday life, so much so that it felt strange.

A shiver ran down her spine. Lisbell, gripping the hem of her dress, took a deep breath. She could see the long hallway ahead. If she ran down there, descended the stairs, and turned right… she would be at the entrance of the mansion. Once she passed through there, she would be out of the mansion for good. She would leave behind the shackles that had gripped her ankles like a snake, the wedding dress that had been meant to make her a bride of hell.

The doorframe, which had been drawn as a line in the sand, loomed ahead.

Just one step.

One step, and freedom would be hers.

 Ulrich’s hand moved smoothly over the documents.

After completing yet another review and corresponding signature, Victor, who had been standing before him, occasionally glancing at his watch, quietly informed him,

“It’s been an hour since Madam left.”

The hand that had been moving without hesitation suddenly stopped. The sharp nib paused mid-stroke, causing ink to pool and form a large blot.

Ulrich slowly lifted the fountain pen. He lightly tapped the round ink blot with the nib before setting the pen down and rising leisurely from his chair. When he was told thirty minutes had passed earlier, he hadn’t reacted, but apparently, an hour was his limit.

Taking out a cigarette, he placed it between his lips. Victor immediately stepped forward to light it for him. Exhaling a stream of smoke, Ulrich moved toward the door and asked,

“What do you think, Victor?”

“…Pardon? What do I think?”

“What do you think happened?”

It was clear what his superior was implying.

As if he took some perverse pleasure in observing Lisbell Osborne’s response to the predicament he had orchestrated—a kind of sadistic curiosity.

“…I’m not sure.”

No more, no less—that was his honest answer.

I really don’t know.

Considering everything she’d endured, one might assume she had learned her lesson. But recalling her desperate pleas to see Madam, she didn’t seem like someone who would break so easily. Yet, if she had fled again, it would just be history repeating itself.

“What I mean is… I don’t think it matters.”

What state of mind had he been in when he said that?

Victor felt not only the exhaustion of dealing with whatever situation Lisbell might create but also the simple discomfort of having to witness it all up close.

Having served Ulrich for many years, he knew his master’s temperament well. He was stubborn and self-reliant. The more someone resisted him, the more inevitable it became that they would be overwhelmed.

For that reason, Victor’s feelings toward Lisbell were akin to watching glass charge toward a collision, knowing it would shatter into pieces. It made him anxious just observing it unfold. That was why he had urged her to give up—because persuading Ulrich was out of the question.

“Do you really need to go this far?”

Fortunately, Lisbell seemed to have heeded his advice, judging by how the two of them had been getting along these past few days.

Despite pretending otherwise, Ulrich was someone whose moods were quite transparent—at least to someone like Victor, who had served him for so long. And for days now, he had been calm. What did that signify? It meant that the conflict with Lisbell, who had sought refuge in religion to escape him, had significantly eased.

Just the other day, he had unshackled her ankle, even taking her into his arms and leading her around the study at a leisurely pace. Bathed in the multicolored light streaming through the windows, the two had looked almost like an intimate couple. That was the peace created by Lisbell’s surrender.

It would have been nice if things ended there. But this madman had devised yet another scheme to test her true feelings. Under the guise of work, he had first excused himself and then had Madam leave after a suitable delay.

Naturally, this left Lisbell alone in the reception room.

A cunning strategy, designed solely to see how she would react to the taste of freedom—it was nothing short of malicious.

“These days, she’s been doing something cute.”

“…Excuse me? What has she been doing?”

“She says she wants to be comfortable now.”



“She doesn’t want to suffer anymore, so she’s going to accept me.”

Following Ulrich as he strode toward the reception room, Victor quietly swallowed. He had wondered if there had been a sudden shift in their relationship, but it turned out she had been the first to say something like that.

Ulrich, walking ahead, suddenly chuckled.

“Isn’t it adorable?”



“It’s obvious she’s playing me, isn’t it?”

Victor unconsciously clenched his fists.

Ulrich had been in a good mood these past few days, no doubt about it. He was even reconsidering a terrible investment proposal he had previously dismissed and had called in a lawyer for legal advice. Until now, Victor had assumed it was all thanks to Lisbell’s sweet words. But had Ulrich been harboring suspicions all along?

“The problem is me.”



“I keep wanting to be fooled.”

His tone carried a hint of self-mockery.

“I keep wanting to fall for it… That’s the problem.”

With doubt so deeply embedded in his mind, trust seemed unattainable, no matter how Lisbell Osborne acted. Victor swallowed the words that threatened to surface.

By then, their brisk steps had come to a halt in front of the reception room.

The door was closed.

Just as it had been when he left.



With the cigarette still between his lips, Ulrich stared down at the doorknob.

He recalled the quiet eyes that had watched him as he unshackled her ankle that morning.

Cute and detestable eyes.

At some point, her gaze had become paradoxical to him. Softer than before, yet somehow, that very gentleness only sparked an ominous sense of foreboding. Sometimes, he wanted to grab her by the throat, squeeze tightly, and demand to know if she was sincere—if she truly intended to stay by his side.

In the past, he would have done just that.

But now, with her acting this way, he couldn’t bring himself to do it. Perhaps because he couldn’t discard the ridiculous glimmer of hope that her determination wasn’t just a shallow ploy but something real.

If that was the case, one wrong move could shatter the delicate sandcastle she had painstakingly built through all her trials.

…Yes, the truth was, he was already more than halfway convinced.

Half? No, perhaps it wasn’t an exaggeration to say he had already lost his composure entirely.

Feeling disgusted with his own foolishness, Ulrich shook his head slightly and gripped the doorknob. Exhaling the smoke lingering under his tongue, he pushed the door open. It swung smoothly without a sound.



The room was quiet. So silent, it seemed no one was there.

A tense vein bulged in Ulrich’s mind. He removed the cigarette from his lips and stubbed it out against the door frame.

Even though he had expected it, the disappointment that settled into his bones was profound.

Of course, she wouldn’t stay.

Looking back, it was absurd to think he could trust a few flattering words. Why had he unlocked the shackle, left her alone, and walked away?

Why did I do that?

I must have been completely out of my mind.

Where did she run off to this time? Did she even have anywhere left to go? He had already torn apart everything—her fiancé, her mother, even the religion she had sought refuge in—so where else could she possibly turn?

Well… where should I start looking? She was probably still within the townhouse. Should he have Victor block off the station first? No matter what, when he brought her back this time, he would—

Just then, a small sound reached his ears.

“…Ouch.”

It came from behind a large clothing rack, about as tall as he was.

Ulrich, who had been standing still with only his fingertips twitching, suddenly snapped out of his daze and strode forward.

Rounding the clothing rack, he spotted a small figure nestled among the dazzlingly colorful dresses. Soft gray hair swayed with her slight movements.

“…Lisbell.”

She was right there.

He had no idea what she was doing, crouched down, staring at her hand as if she had hurt her finger. Only when he called her name did she finally notice his presence.

Calmly, she lifted her head. Her violet eyes turned toward him, creating a surreal feeling—as if he were seeing an illusion.

“…Pfft.”

Ulrich let out a laugh.

Only when the sound of air popping like bubbles reached his ears did he realize—he was the one laughing.


Precisely…

 

Lisbell’s gaze reached the face of the man pressing close to her cheek.

 

Her freedom was in the hands of this man.

 

As long as this man treated her like a toy in his hand, simply distancing herself physically was not the solution. No matter how much she ran away, became disillusioned, struggled, or despaired, unless she destroyed the root of oppression named Ulrich Altahart, it would be an endless cycle.

 

That’s why she didn’t run away.

 

There was no longer any use in curling up and raising the white flag.

 

“If you want to win, you have to be bold.”

 

Did he know?

 

What kind of feelings the person giving him that advice truly held.

 

He probably didn’t know.

 

That’s why, from that day on, he didn’t shackle Lisbell’s ankles.

 



 

Clang, clang.

 

Unlike the sofa in Ulrich’s bedroom, the velvet sofa in the reception room with its arched legs shook noisily with the slightest movement.

 

Thud, thud! Lisbell’s waist twisted uncontrollably, unable to withstand the force pushing up from below. Each time, the man’s hands, sculpted like stone, grabbed her hips and thrust more deeply into her groin.

 

“Mm, mm… Ah… Ahh…!”

 

Their lower bodies, locked together, became wet. The column-shaped hole was already covered in a foamy haze from the relentless piston thrusts.

 

Each time the thick manhood slid along the slick, sensitive path, Lisbell’s calves trembled lightly as they pointed towards the sky.

 

Like a stallion lost in the taste of lust, Ulrich was busy rocking his hips. Each time, he grasped her ankles again and planted a soft kiss near her ankle bone.

 

The eerie sensation of a shackle often lingered there, making the man’s bird-like kiss unbearably unsettling. Even while her body rocked, a subtle chill didn’t leave her.

 

“Ah, here… It’s incredibly soft.”

 

As he thrust up into her connected depths, the line of his back, tightly clad in a shirt and vest, displayed a sinful rhythm. The morning sunlight shone in a way that couldn’t hide it.

 

“Lisbell, because you’re relaxing… Ha, it goes in even deeper than usual. Can you feel it? Here, mm…”

 

As if he wanted her to feel it, he pushed his pulsing organ deep into the tight inner flesh. The swelling sensation spread as if her cervix was being pierced. It was so full that it made her dizzy.

 

As the rounded head pushed up like a greeting, a flickering tremor spread across her vision. Lisbell’s lower abdomen involuntarily tightened, and her half-closed eyelids quivered deeply.

 

Ulrich, who chuckled at her receptive response, lazily shook his rod, buried deep in her hole.

 

Though his thrusts weren’t strong, the vivid sensation of his glans rubbing against her inner walls left Lisbell’s lips parted. Ulrich eagerly leaned forward and thrust his stiff tongue into her open mouth.

 

“Mm, mm… Mm! Huh, ah, ahh!”

 

As their bodies tangled, the sofa began to groan sorrowfully again.

 

Ulrich carelessly rolled up the dress he had personally chosen for her. The intense stimulation made him want to tear apart everything his hands could reach.

 

The intense surge of excitement was expressed through his thrusting. Thud, thud! He struck her wide-open perineum, spreading and widening her tight entrance.

 

The slick, foamy connection emitted obscene sounds that echoed throughout the reception room. The air grew hot with the steamy atmosphere of their erotic encounter.

 

Knock, knock.

 

A knock suddenly interrupted.

 

“Master, it’s time for you to leave.”

 

Victor’s voice faintly came from outside.

 

Lisbell flinched momentarily, but Ulrich, lost in the heat of the moment, was engrossed in exploring her as if he were deaf to all other sounds. Even if a bomb dropped right in front of him, he seemed ready to bury himself in her flesh and lose himself in lust.

 

“Ha, mm, outside… Mm… Ahh…!”

 

“Mm…?”

 

“Outside, there are people, mm, mm, ugh…!”

 

“It’s okay, ha, you don’t need to, care.”

 

It was clear that he didn’t want her to care about anything except him.

 

As Lisbell, spread wide open, was pressed deeper into the sofa, Ulrich swallowed his ragged breath and increased his pace.

 

His thrusts grew rougher as the flesh inside her pushed against her vaginal walls, reaching the brink. Her entire body contracted, unable to breathe, and Ulrich’s breath melted out in response.

 

“Did it go deep, mm?”

 

“Mm, mm…!”

 

“It’s squeezing so tight. Mm? What should I do? If it’s like this, I won’t want to leave….”

 

He chuckled and lifted Lisbell’s skirt. Grasping her plump buttocks, he spread her wide open to reveal her perineum. Then, he shot forward and thrust his manhood deep inside.

 

“Mm, ahh, ng, ha…!”

 

As the rough surface of his veined manhood scraped her tender entrance, Lisbell gulped down her breath.

 

She reached out and caressed Ulrich’s body. Slipping her hand through the open neckline of his shirt, exposed by the loosened tie, she touched his skin. A raspy, hoarse sound escaped Ulrich’s mouth. The organ buried inside her shivered in sync with its owner, swelling with arousal.

 

Ulrich could never resist when Lisbell touched him of her own will. His jaw muscles clenched violently as he hugged her thigh and roughly thrust up.

 

Though his size was formidable, the lubricating effect of her juices and foam allowed her inner walls to soften enough to embrace him. With each piston thrust of his hardened manhood, the pleasure quickly escalated.

 

“Master,” came Victor’s voice again from outside, urging him to leave.

 

Ulrich gripped Lisbell’s lips, kissing them forcefully as he intensified his pace. His neat attire became disheveled, but he continued his thrusts with no regard for his appearance.

 

“Ah, ha…!”

 

“Mm, hoo.”

 

His intense yet controlled movements were frighteningly persistent. Finally, Lisbell’s insides reached their limit, and she squeezed her entrance tightly around him. Ulrich, his base swallowed up, couldn’t resist the suction of her inner walls and climaxed.

 

“Mm, mm…”

 

“Ha…”

 

As the two tangled together, their intertwined bodies let out a shared sigh of release.

 

Regaining his composure, Ulrich, still caressing Lisbell’s buttocks, continued his idle hand-play.

 

Lisbell, who was catching her breath, her hand still tracing his neck, met his eyes. Ulrich smiled seductively, like a red rose.

 

“Today, I’ll be back after just a simple dinner gathering….”

 

Thump!

 

The sound of someone impatiently banging on the door was heard then.

 

Ulrich, who had been busy groping her body even as he climaxed, finally withdrew his hand reluctantly. His low, smooth voice, tinged with irritation, softly called out, “Victor Loisden….”

 

Lisbell, lying there with a dazed expression, looked up at him.

 

Perhaps he was pleased with her submissiveness, beyond compliance, to the point of being as docile as a lamb. Ulrich, who had lowered her skirt himself, rolled it up again and spread her legs.

 

He kissed her entrance, soaked with his mark, and said, “I’ll be back.” If anyone saw, they would be shocked by such a shameless act, yet he committed it with a nonchalant expression as he stood up.

 

Soon after, the sound of the door opening and closing echoed.

 

Lisbell, trying to steady her breath even after Ulrich had left, closed her eyes tightly.

 

Her hand fell and grazed between her legs. She lifted it to her eyes. Her index, middle, and ring fingers were covered in his white semen that had spilled out as he withdrew.


Lisbell rubbed her palms against the sofa seat as if she had just come into contact with something vile. Her movements grew increasingly erratic, almost convulsive, as though she were in the throes of a severe fit.

Then, abruptly, her limbs went limp. The hand that had been obsessively scrubbing at the fabric lifted to cover her eyes.

Blocking out her vision and plunging herself into darkness, she finally managed to steady her breath. Yet, no matter how desperately she tried, the lingering sensation of semen on her fingertips refused to fade, tormenting her with every passing second.

The trace of a man left within her body.

The weight of what that meant.

The inevitable, horrifying consequence twisted her thoughts into chaos.

‘No….’

She couldn’t even fully form the thought—not even in fragments. The mere idea of carrying his child was so grotesque, so repulsive, that her mind recoiled from it. But more than anything, what terrified her most was the possibility that it could become reality.

‘I have to do something….’

I must.

If this continues, my child will—

Thankfully, she had been granted some degree of freedom within the mansion. Ever since the wedding dress fitting, Ulrich had stopped imposing restrictions on her movements, even when she returned to the bedroom. That was how she had managed to slip away today, retreating to the drawing room unnoticed.

Of course, he was still keeping an eye on her.

He was the kind of man who could feign warmth while plotting something sinister in the shadows. Lisbell knew she had to remain vigilant, pretending to accept her circumstances as if she had lost all hope of escape. As if there was nothing left for him to break—not even a fragment.

Enduring his touch and not resisting the traces he left on her body was part of the game she was playing. If she truly wanted to destroy him, she had to be willing to lose herself in the process. Without that level of resolve, she wouldn’t even be able to leave a scratch.

But still.

The feeling of lying there, his presence clinging to her skin—

She forced herself to swallow down the dark emotions rising within her. Pushing off the sofa, she steadied herself.

‘Should I look for the medicine? Didn’t they put something like that in my food before? But where? The kitchen? Or is there a separate storage room? What if Ulrich hears of it? What if he grows suspicious? I haven’t even found the right tools yet—what if he puts the shackles on me again…?’

She sat there in a daze, slowly fastening the buttons of her dress, which had loosened to reveal her skin.

“…Please, madam! The master has ordered that no one be allowed in here for the time being….”

A commotion erupted outside the closed door. Lisbell turned her head just as the door suddenly swung open. The intrusion was forceful, as though someone had insisted on entering despite the servant’s protests.

“Who is inside that I am forbidden from seeing?”

The voice belonged to none other than Mrs. Altahart.

She halted upon seeing Lisbell seated on the sofa.

This was the first time Lisbell had encountered her since arriving at the mansion. Despite wandering the estate for days, she had never once crossed paths with the woman, leading her to assume she had been staying elsewhere. Apparently, that wasn’t the case.

Behind the lady stood a flustered servant, his unease palpable. Clearly, Ulrich had issued an order barring anyone from entering this room—something Lisbell had been unaware of until now.

Seeing the servant hesitate, uncertain of what to do, Lisbell gave him a small nod. Understanding the silent command, he quickly bowed, shut the door, and disappeared.

Mrs. Altahart let out a derisive laugh.

“I wondered why I was being kept out, and it turns out… you were in here.”

Her refined voice, as polished as a classical performance, was laced with invisible thorns.

“If anyone saw this, they might mistake you for the mistress of this house, Miss Osborne.”

The way she spoke left no room for doubt—this was not a misunderstanding.

Of course, she must have been utterly baffled. After all, she had once extended a helping hand, only for Lisbell to flee on her own, only to end up back here—captured and dragged into the mansion again.

Mrs. Altahart crossed the room, settling on the opposite sofa. Meanwhile, Lisbell quietly continued fastening the buttons of her dress, saying nothing.

The lady’s cold gaze swept over Lisbell’s body, still marked by the remnants of intercourse. Her blue irises darkened with disdain, like vines creeping over an icy lake. It was the look of someone staring at a leech, one that was draining her precious son’s wealth and power.

Under her scrutiny, Lisbell finished buttoning her dress to the very top. She appeared calm, lost in thought, but her silence seemed to infuriate Mrs. Altahart further.

“Have you had a change of heart?”



“Well, I suppose the position of mistress in this house must be quite appealing for someone of your station.”



“I thought at least some of the courage and defiance you displayed when demanding your mother’s funeral would remain, but it seems I overestimated you. Then again, with such a frail constitution, it’s no wonder you let things reach this point.”

It was clear she believed Lisbell had chosen to stay by Ulrich’s side of her own free will. After all, she was now part of the family, and no doubt, the lady had heard whispers of the wedding Ulrich was preparing alone—without consulting anyone.

“Madam, do I look happy to you?”

After a long silence, Lisbell finally spoke.

Mrs. Altahart’s lips parted as if to respond, but the words stalled.

Her icy blue eyes took in Lisbell once more—her gaunt frame, the bandages still wrapped around her neck, the unmistakable frailty that even Ulrich’s expensive clothes could not conceal. It was a wound wealth could not heal, a scar too deep to be hidden.

“Do I look like I’m doing this by choice?”



“No, I’ve given up.”

Mrs. Altahart’s expression flickered, ever so slightly. Lisbell continued, her voice composed.

“Have you ever felt molten wax drip onto your skin, burning you?”



“Have you ever had your ankle snapped beneath someone’s hand?”



“Do you know what it’s like to live in constant fear, only to have the safe haven you finally found ripped away from you?”



“Madam, I’m exhausted by the pain.”



“So I’ve simply given up.”

Her voice was smooth, as if reciting a decision long since made.

There was a time when she had begged Ulrich’s secretary.

‘Please, bring the madam to me. Let me meet her, or at least send her my words….’

But the response had been unchanging.

‘He is no longer just the young master—he is the head of this family. Even the madam can no longer stop him.’

Even Mrs. Altahart could no longer be her shield. If anything, she was now in greater danger. And judging by her bitter attitude, she knew it.

Mrs. Altahart was not overtly hostile, but she was hardly an ally. She was someone who prioritized the family above all else.

Even so, Lisbell saw an opportunity.

“I don’t want to be here—I’m only enduring this, waiting for your son to grow bored of me. As I said, I’ve stopped fighting back because I can’t bear the suffering anymore.”



“But… I don’t want to have Ulrich’s child.”

For the first time, Mrs. Altahart’s composed expression wavered.

“When Ulrich is done with me, I want to leave without any ties. And in this matter, I believe our interests align, madam.”

“…You’re asking me for medicine?”

“If you don’t want the noble bloodline of your family to be tainted.”

Even as she spoke, the words felt wretched—describing her own blood as unworthy. But it was a thousand times better than allowing that nightmare to come true. She would rather scar herself than bear his child.
