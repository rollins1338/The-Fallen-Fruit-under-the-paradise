

Chapter 32 .

However, everything in this world comes at a cost.

 

Tasks that are given astronomical amounts of money have a reason for it.

 

From serving under his peer closely, Victor realized that not only Ulrich but his entire family was a den of madness.

 

Do the rich always play around like this?

 

Every time an incident occurred, he couldn’t help but think about how grand the scale was. The grotesqueness was a given, and sometimes it was accompanied by a repulsive discomfort.

 

In other words, they did not hide the obscene and blatant instincts underlying human consciousness. This seemed related to their family background… Perhaps because they could obtain anything easily from a young age, even the elements to alleviate their boredom were extraordinary. Drugs and gang rapes were trivial, so what more could be said?

 

Victor stopped pondering about their humanity. Perhaps it was right after he saw Ulrich mingling with a married woman in a lounge at a charity event hosted by the Iroo family.

 

The lady, with her slender legs wrapped around Ulrich’s waist and moaning loudly, was clearly the hostess of the Iroo family that hosted the event that day.

 

That wasn’t all. The entire family, including Ulrich, was completely depraved. They were devoted to corrupting the customs with all their might. Perhaps it was lucky that they had the power to control and manipulate the media, allowing them to hide such aspects.

 

“Should I sue him?”

 

“What?”

 

“It’s clearly a breach of contract. Don’t you think we could do it if we got a lawyer?”

 

Ulrich, as if he was about to reach for the phone, twitched his fingers resting on his knee. Victor covered his face with his hands, hoping he would refrain.

 

“So, are you planning to form a family lawyer team?”

 

“If possible.”

 

“And then sue Young Master Gwen? Do you think that makes sense?”

 

“Things that don’t make sense often do, when money is involved.”

 

Nothing about serving a nobleman was easy, but recently, the most troubling issue was this. The disputes between the Altahart brothers, who were always at each other’s throats since childhood, only intensified as they grew older.

 

The reason Ulrich ended up at the secluded Marnia villa was also related to this.

 

It started with a trivial bet.

 

The Altahart family’s business had diversified into several fields over time.

 

Under the leadership of the Altahart matriarch, who took over the international banking sector following her late husband, the two brothers each carved out their own business territories based on their interests and positions.

 

The eldest son, Gwen Altahart, who was set to become the head of the family, took control of the oil industry, which showed great potential following banking. Ulrich, on the other hand, took charge of the hotel business in the capital, which he had steadily developed since coming of age. Other sectors like the jewelry and wine industries were also divided under their names.

 

The only business they shared jointly was a department store in the capital.

 

The department store, with five floors built along the main street next to the square, boasted much higher profits than expected. It could leverage various family businesses, was useful for managing connections, and had a bright future.

 

The department store, which both brothers coveted, had not been clearly divided, and thus had been jointly operated. During this time, they relentlessly tore each other apart.

 

In Victor’s view, Ulrich was the more talented businessman. He had an instinctive sense of how to roll money to make it grow.

 

In contrast, Gwen, the eldest, was greedy but lacked skills. The profits from his projects were largely due to the inherent profitability of the business rather than his ability. If Ulrich had taken on those projects, the profit margins would have been at least twice as high.

 

Gwen wasn’t a particularly good manager. However, being an Altahart, he was also prideful. He had big dreams and was greedy.

 

Naturally, he interfered with the department store business frequently.

 

When problems arose due to his interference, he never reconsidered his decisions but instead blamed his subordinates. When frustrated, he would call in high-class prostitutes and lock himself in his bedroom for days, indulging in drugs and merrymaking.

 

Gwen was neither responsible nor thoughtful.

 

In contrast, Ulrich only interfered when necessary, and though he found everything a bother, he saw tasks through to the end. This wasn’t always the case; he seemed to find pleasure in watching money grow based on his decisions as he inherited more of the family’s business.

 

The bet over the department store management rights stemmed from such trivial disagreements.

 

“You crazy bastard… Ulrich, do you even think? The new tenants on the third floor must be the finest whiskey from the Hohen Kingdom. Are you going to stash that precious cash cow somewhere?”

 

“Gwen, did you plug your ears? We’re planning to clear out the store and turn it into a tea room. The construction schedule is already set, and we’re about to start. What nonsense are you talking about?”

 

“Tea room? Tea roooom? In a department store where people come to spend money? Do you want them to sit and listen to orchestras and laugh? Is this a party hall? Are you not planning to sell goods? It’s more profitable to increase tenants and salesi”

 

“Wanna bet?”

 

“What?”

 

“Whether the department store’s total sales will increase or decrease after the tea room is established.”

 

“Hah, look at this lunatic. Fine, let’s bet. I bet it will decrease.”

 

“I bet it will increase.”

 

“The deadline is three months after the construction.”

 

“Fine.”

 

“What will you give up if I win?”

 

“The management rights of the department store.”

 

“What?”

 

“I’m sick of this constant bickering. Let’s settle this once and for all. The loser steps back.”

 

“You short-sighted fool… Fine, let’s end thisi”

 

In the end, Ulrich was the winner.

 

The tea room, established in a department store with no suitable gathering place, became a new social hub for the upper class.

 

The upper class’s desire to show off could not be overlooked. People who used to visit the department store casually began to spruce up their appearance. They gathered in groups, eager to find something that made them stand out.

 

The most notable thing was the shopping list, of course.

 

People engaged in subtle competitions to show who had the deepest pockets by buying the most expensive items. As a result, the department store’s sales skyrocketed.

 

Thus, the department store became Ulrich’s.

 

At least, that’s what Ulrich and his secretary, Victor, thought.

 

The variable was Gwen.

 

Despite his loud declaration to settle things, Gwen played dumb when the results didn’t favor him. It was a cowardly stance, but since the promise was verbal, there was no tangible evidence.

 

But Ulrich didn’t back down easily. Every morning, the first thing he did was send a letter of renunciation of joint management rights to his brother’s bedroom. Gwen, of course, ignored him.

 

After more than twenty letters were ignored, Ulrich’s patience ran out.

 

“…Oh my god.”

 

One morning, Victor, while sipping strong coffee and reading the newspaper, spat out his drink.

 

What the…?

 

He couldn’t believe his eyes as coffee dripped from his lips.

 

Altahart’s eldest son. The heir of the family. Gwen Altahart. Homosexual. Prostitute. Male prostitute. Orgy. Drugs. Sex scandal. Engagement. Schwaben family.

 

All kinds of obscene and dirty words adorned the front page of the capital’s tabloids.

 

Naturally, the family was in an uproar.

 

Investing an enormous amount every quarter to manage the media was to ensure that such sordid personal lives were never exposed.

 

They had so tightly controlled the flow of information that not a hint of truth had ever leaked, maintaining an image of nobility and mystery. Despite the sordid reality, the Altaharts were revered as wealthy elites by the people of Rechem.

 

The perfect sandcastle they had built was now on the verge of collapsing.

 

Victor was particularly shocked.

 

It was only natural.

 

The one who had leaked this horrific scandal was his own boss, Ulrich.


Chapter 33.


As soon as Victor regained his senses, he was summoned to the mansion.

 

Dragged before his employer, Victor reported everything he knew. Meanwhile, Gwen Altahart crumpled up tabloid papers with his face plastered across them, cursing loudly, and their mother, Lady Altahart, rubbed her temples with an exasperated look.

 

“So, in the end…”

 



 

“Are you saying this mess all started from a bet?”

 

“Yes, ma’am…”

 

“Unbelievable, I’m at my wits’ end.”

 

Lady Altahart, the current head of the family, was at a loss for words at her two adult sons, behaving no better than seven-year-old children.

 

Gwen, seething with anger, shouted from the side.

 

“Motheri Please issue a summons for this wretch immediatelyi”

 

“Gwen, calm yourself.”

 

“How can I calm down? We’ve always maintained strict privacyi It’s a principle our family has upheld meticulously since our ancestors’ times. This rascal has gone too far. Such a disgraceful method is intolerable as an Altaharti”

 

“And is your behavior as the loser of the bet acceptable as an Altahart?”

 

“Motheri”

 

“Enough, keep your mouth shut. Right now, it’s not Ulrich tarnishing the Altahart name but your vulgar lust, shamelessly showing itself without regard for men or women.”

 

Lady Altahart sternly reprimanded her eldest son and sighed deeply. The young handsome man standing behind her cautiously patted her shoulder.

 

Gwen laughed at the sight. To criticize his preferences while his mother selected the most handsome men from the capital as her bedmates wasn’t much different.

 

“Victor.”

 

“Yes, ma’am.”

 

“You need to go to Ulrich.”

 

Ulrich had utterly shattered the family’s principle of secrecy and leisurely left the capital at dawn. It was a swift escape, anticipating this mess.

 

But then again, when hadn’t he been like that?

 

He was never in the present. Sometimes fearfully, sometimes tenaciously, he glimpsed beyond with meticulous precision.

 

Anyhow, the ensuing chaos continued to this day.

 

Victor found himself caught in the middle of this mess. The capital was demanding Ulrich’s return urgently, but his boss showed no intention of returning. Instead, he seemed to be settling in this place called Marnia, enjoying the tranquil days.

 

“This isn’t fun.”

 

Or maybe “enjoying” wasn’t the right word.

 

Checkmate.

 

Victor’s king was surrounded on the chessboard. Ulrich flicked the king over with a finger, toppling the surrounding pieces.

 

With a perfect visual victory, Ulrich lit a cigarette with a bored expression.

 

“What about the investigation I asked for?”

 

Victor sighed. This wasn’t the time to discuss such trivial matters, but it was better to appease him than to irritate him.

 

He retrieved some documents from a pile.

 

“You wanted information on Theodore Motier and his family.”

 

He found and handed over the desired paper. Ulrich, adjusting the cigarette in his mouth, flipped through it. Watching him read, Victor voiced his ongoing doubt.

 

“They run a small factory in the Renbruck industrial complex. Is there a problem with them?”

 

“They keep coming to mind.”

 

“Excuse me? What keeps coming to mind?”

 

Ulrich fell silent again.

 

Victor, accustomed to his unilateral silence, continued to search for any remaining reports.

 

“A textile factory?”

 

Ulrich, exhaling leisurely, muttered the words written on the paper.

 

“Yes? Ah, yes.”

 

“Is there a large farm in Renbruck?”

 

“There are fertile fields on the outskirts of the city. They contract with those farms to procure raw materials.”

 

Ulrich nodded faintly.

 

He continued reading with frightening concentration until more than half of his cigarette was gone.

 

Actually, with each line he read, different thoughts filled his mind.

 

“Ugh, ugh…!”

 

“I thought it was just once, and it was all over….”

 

His thigh stung. He was so deep in thought he didn’t notice the cigarette ash falling on his leg. He just stared at the mark and muttered.

 

“It keeps coming to mind.”

 

“…What keeps coming to mind?”

 

It was petty revenge.

 

Repaying a rejection at the pavilion with a forcefully obtained one-night stand. He wouldn’t deny the underlying selfishness, but more vividly, it was the desire to restore his wounded pride.

 

Using Lady Osborne as a means, blackmailing her with maternal love, and indulging in the delicate body as he pleased for a night.

 

Ulrich felt no moral guilt from these actions. The injury she might suffer was nothing compared to his need to relieve his unpleasant mood.

 

All his relationships were like that. He valued his own emotional fluctuations more than a person’s life.

 

And he thought once was enough for such a ruthless solution. After resolving the irritation, he expected his peace to return.

 

But it kept…

 

“Her crying face was beautiful.”

 



 

“So it keeps coming to mind….”

 

Victor had a puzzled look, not understanding a word. Before he could ask more, there was a knock on the closed door. After a brief wait, Lady Osborne appeared.

 

“I brought new refreshments.”

 

“Ah, thank you.”

 

Victor thanked her and clumsily cleared the document-filled table. Meanwhile, Lady Osborne approached and set down the tray.

 

Ulrich shifted his gaze from the papers to her.

 

Lady Osborne had submitted her resignation a few days ago. She didn’t specify the reason, but Ulrich had a good guess.

 

Lisbell must have persuaded her.

 

But her attitude showed no sign of contempt or discomfort, suggesting she hadn’t told her everything.

 

See, I told you.

 

She couldn’t bring herself to speak about it.

 

A woman who tears up at the mere mention of her mother wouldn’t dare reveal such intimate details. Ulrich chuckled. Lady Osborne glanced at him while pouring the drinks. He shook his head to indicate it was nothing.

 

He turned his gaze to the window.

 

The sunlight was harsh, and the occasional wind that stirred the leaves and buds was hot.

 

Marnia was in the midst of a full-blown summer.

 

Summer at its peak would gradually lose its heat.

 

He had never regretted this before, even despising the heat, wishing each year for it to pass quickly… but now he wanted time to slow down.

 

Because there was a bride for late summer.

 



 

Ulrich lowered his eyes.

 

Without realizing it, he had crushed the cigarette between his fingers.

 

The small bits of cigarette dirtied his fingers.

 

He stared at the mess, brushing it off with his thumb as if he had discovered something strange. Victor, puzzled, handed him a handkerchief. Accepting it, Ulrich repeatedly wiped and examined his fingers.

 

Finally, when his hands were clean, Ulrich spoke.

 

“Ma’am.”

 

“Yes, sir?”

 

“Late summer will be here soon.”

 

“Excuse me?”

 

“Is Lisbell’s wedding preparation going well?”

 

“Ah… yes, I believe so.”

 

Hmm, is that so?

 

It wasn’t welcoming news.

 

“Where is the wedding going to be held?”

 

“Misley.”

 

“Misley, in the east.”

 

Ulrich repeated, smiling lazily.

 

It had always been a lingering doubt.

 

Even now, it was vague, but one thing was clear.

 

The reason he didn’t want late summer to come.

 

“It’s not as far as I thought, which is good.”

 

He wanted to ruin Lisbell’s wedding.

Chapter 34.


Mrs. Osborne tilted the coffee pot, releasing a stream of steam. The faint aroma of coffee intensified, filling the room. The foil-adorned coffee cup floated in her hand, just before it was placed on the table.

 

Crashi

 

Victor, who had been tidying the pile of papers, looked startled. He stood up immediately upon seeing the shattered cup on the floor.

 

“Madam, are you alright? Did any shards hit you?”

 

“Oh, no. I’m fine.”

 

“This is unfortunate. It’s completely broken.”

 

“I’m sorry. It was my mistake…”

 

Victor nodded as if he understood and bent down. Warning her to be careful of the sharp fragments, he began clearing the larger pieces.

 

Meanwhile, Ulrich remained motionless, simply observing the scene. His deepening gaze was fixed on Mrs. Osborne, or more precisely, on her hand that had been holding the cup.

 

“Madam.”

 

“Yes, Master.”

 

“Did your hand shake just now?”

 

To Ulrich’s knowledge, she did not suffer from tremors. Thus, the earlier movement seemed very unnatural. To him, it signified only one thing.

 

“Is there something wrong with your health?”

 

“No, nothing at all. I’ll prepare a fresh pot of coffee immediately.”

 

Though she tried to maintain a professional demeanor, Ulrich noticed her hesitation before grabbing the pot again, a sign that the earlier tremor was involuntary.

 

Come to think of it…

 

He recalled the errand he had sent her on the previous day.

 

A fabricated incident involving bribing the Marnia officials and other related tasks. Mrs. Osborne needed to leave the villa temporarily to deceive Lisbell.

 

Despite Victor’s presence, Ulrich had insisted on sending Mrs. Osborne on the errand.

 

She took longer than expected.

 

It was a simple task—delivering an entrusted item to a foreign family with whom they had long-standing ties. For Victor, with a family-provided carriage, it would have been a day’s job. But Mrs. Osborne took longer than anticipated, making it barely in time to avoid ruining everything.

 

Timing worked out, so Ulrich hadn’t questioned it then. But now, he understood that her health might have delayed her.

 

“Is your health the reason you submitted your resignation a few days ago?”

 

Mrs. Osborne looked up as she set the hastily brewed coffee in front of Ulrich. He smiled at her before turning to Victor.

 

“Victor, is there a doctor we can summon from the city?”

 

“A doctor?”

 

While Victor questioned this, Mrs. Osborne quickly straightened, realizing Ulrich’s intention.

 

“Master, I appreciate your concern, but I assure you I am fine. There’s no need to worry.”

 

“To me, this isn’t even a concern, Madam.”

 

“But…”

 

“Consider it my kindness before you resign.”

 



 

“Our meeting here is fate, after all.”

 

Fate.

 

Ulrich smirked, unwilling to listen to any objections. He unfolded a paper, savoring the word. It felt pleasant on his tongue.

 

He smiled quietly, a serene smile that subdued the fierce summer sun.

 



 

Giggles, giggles.

 

Listening to the children’s innocent laughter, Lisbell leaned back. She sat on an old bench, the only shaded area behind the orphanage. Recently, the summer had deepened, causing sweat to pour out just by standing outside for a moment.

 

“Oh…!”

 

Something touched her cheek as she sat absentmindedly.

 

Startled, she straightened to find Theodore, who had been playing with the children, approaching. He held a reddish flower and smiled brightly.

 

“You scared me. What’s with the flower?”

 

“It’s a trumpet vine. I brought it to show you since it bloomed inside.”

 

Theodore sat beside her and placed the flower behind her ear, making her laugh. He then gently touched her forehead.

 

“How do you feel?”

 

“Much better.”

 

“Still, you should rest today. There’s no need to push yourself.”

 

Hesitating, Lisbell took his hand from her cheek and shook her head, indicating she was fine.

 

She knew why he was worried.

 

Since returning from Marnia, Lisbell had been ill for a week.

 

It started with muscle pain. Seeing Theodore at the train station, her tension melted away, and her whole body ached. Every step felt heavy and painful.

 

Back at the orphanage, she developed a fever. Her body rebelled, realizing it was finally home.

 

For days, she suffered a severe fever, her white skin blooming with heat rashes.

 

Theodore took care of her devotedly, cooling her with cold hands, wiping her sweat, and holding her when she felt nauseous.

 

After a week of care, she recovered. By then, the wound inflicted by Ulrich had also improved. Luckily, Theodore thought she had a simple fever.

 

“I should inform Madam. She was very worried about you.”

 

After three days of fever, when she could finally speak, Lisbell answered Theodore’s pressing questions.

 

The events in Marnia were just a misunderstanding, she said.

 

Everything was resolved.

 

Her mother was safe.

 

There were no problems….

 

Half-truths and half-lies.

 

When she finished, Theodore hugged her tightly. In his arms, she vaguely realized it was more about convincing herself than him.

 

Feeling his gentle touch, Lisbell sensed her heart pounding with foreboding.

 

A heavy burden had settled in her heart.

 

She now had a secret she could never share with Theodore.

 

Ulrich’s presence had changed everything. Now, she had something to hide from Theodore.

 

She returned to Misley longing for his warmth, but every embrace made her anxious. The burden in her heart grew.

 

“The weather is so hot; it must be uncomfortable not tying your hair.”

 

Theodore tucked her grey hair behind her ear, his touch lingering on her exposed white neck. The sensation made Lisbell flinch.

 

“I-it’s fine. This much is okay.”

 

But the evidence of what she tried to hide remained.

 

The bruise on her neck.

 

The scarf Ulrich had given her had hidden it from her mother. But she had thrown it away the moment she left the villa, unable to bear it.

 

So, Theodore saw the bruise. She blamed it on a fall, but even she knew it was a weak excuse. Her poor condition had deflected further questions.

 

“Lisbell, by any chance….”

 

Theodore began to speak after a moment of silence.

 

Thud, roll.

 

Something rolled to Lisbell’s feet.

 

A bright red apple. 


Chapter 35.


A round shape cast a long shadow behind it.

 

Lisbell held her breath.

 

It had been like this ever since she started seeing those dismal shadows. After witnessing someone’s cruel nature in the shadows that must form as brilliantly as the afternoon light, she often found herself like this.

 

“Lisbelli”

 

A girl with short hair and a petite frame, Mary, suddenly appeared. The world that had momentarily stopped for Lisbell resumed its normal pace.

 

Mary picked up an apple that had rolled to Lisbell’s feet and held it out to her.

 

“It’s a fallen fruit.”

 

Lisbell blinked and then laughed.

 

“Is this for me?”

 

“Yesi”

 

“Thank you. But weren’t we all harvesting together? What if you get scolded later for giving this to me secretly?”

 

Behind the orphanage, there was a small garden and a modest apple orchard. The apples were used for the children’s education, for their meals, and were even sold at the market near the port.

 

Teachers and children had gathered here early in the morning to harvest the ripe apples. Lisbell had come out to experience the bustle firsthand.

 

“Well, the teacher said this was a fallen fruit, so it’s not needed.”

 

“Ah…”

 

Lisbell looked at the fruit in Mary’s hand. Mary, clinging to her knee, asked,

 

“Hey, Lisbell, what’s a fallen fruit?”

 

“It’s a fruit that falls from the tree before it’s harvested.”

 

“I see. But why isn’t it needed?”

 

“Well… When a fruit falls to the ground, it gets bruised or dirty, so its value decreases.”

 

Though she explained it logically, Lisbell also found it hard to understand. Looking around, the apple only had some dirt on it, and seemed otherwise fine.

 

But to think its market value dropped just because it fell before proper harvesting.

 

It seemed unfair to the fruit, which probably didn’t fall on purpose. Lisbell rubbed the apple’s surface with her sleeve, revealing a transparent red hue.

 

“Thanks. Even if it’s a fallen fruit, it’s a precious gift to me.”

 

“Really?”

 

She patted Mary’s head as the girl, with a flushed face, asked again. Mary, who had been chattering while leaning on Lisbell’s knee, dashed off as soon as she heard someone calling her from afar.

 

Lisbell looked down at her knee where the child’s warmth had vanished. An apple and a single trumpet creeper blossom lay neatly on it.

 

“Do you like it that much?”

 

“Huh?”

 

“You couldn’t take your eyes off it.”

 

“Just…”

 

Looking at it brought her peace. Her turbulent mind calmed, and the inexplicable anxiety subsided. Perhaps it was the warmth she had always felt in Misley.

 

So, is this my sanctuary?

 

As Lisbell toyed with the vibrant red petals, she glanced to the side.

 

“By the way, wasn’t there something you wanted to say earlier?”

 

“Oh.”

 

He awkwardly scratched the back of his neck.

 

“Well… I was wondering if something happened in Marnia.”

 

The hand playing with the petals stopped.

 

“Since you came back, you seem to be in a daze more often.”

 

“…Nothing happened.”

 

“Really? Maybe it’s just travel fatigue since you had to rush back and forth. The distance between the two regions is quite significant.”

 

“Yeah, probably.”

 

Her mind seemed to short-circuit for a moment.

 

She couldn’t think about what expression she was making or how it might look to Theodore.

 

“Theo, sorry if I made you worry.”

 

“It’s finei We’re about to get married, so it’s natural for me to take care of you.”

 

“…Right.”

 

“Wow, time really flies. It feels like just yesterday when we told the director together. Don’t you think so?”

 

Looking up at the sky, Theodore reminisced as he pushed her long hair back and stroked her cheek. His hand felt warmer than before.

 

No, her skin had cooled that much.

 

Or perhaps it was her heart….

 

“Anyway, we can’t fall behind the kids. I’ll join in and finish quickly. Lisbell, if it gets too hot, don’t push yourself and go rest insidei”

 

Lisbell watched Theodore’s lithe figure as he shouted and dashed off. All that remained was the pounding of her heart.

 

As she stood there, she noticed a crushed flower petal. The wrinkles from being squished looked grotesque. She couldn’t even remember when it had ended up in such a state.

 

That was the problem.

 

Her sanctuary had started to crack.
