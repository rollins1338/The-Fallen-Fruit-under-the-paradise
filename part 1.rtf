



Come to think of it…

 

He recalled the errand he had sent her on the previous day.

 

A fabricated incident involving bribing the Marnia officials and other related tasks. Mrs. Osborne needed to leave the villa temporarily to deceive Lisbell.

 

Despite Victor’s presence, Ulrich had insisted on sending Mrs. Osborne on the errand.

 

She took longer than expected.

 

It was a simple task—delivering an entrusted item to a foreign family with whom they had long-standing ties. For Victor, with a family-provided carriage, it would have been a day’s job. But Mrs. Osborne took longer than anticipated, making it barely in time to avoid ruining everything.

 

Timing worked out, so Ulrich hadn’t questioned it then. But now, he understood that her health might have delayed her.

 

“Is your health the reason you submitted your resignation a few days ago?”

 

Mrs. Osborne looked up as she set the hastily brewed coffee in front of Ulrich. He smiled at her before turning to Victor.

 

“Victor, is there a doctor we can summon from the city?”

 

“A doctor?”

 

While Victor questioned this, Mrs. Osborne quickly straightened, realizing Ulrich’s intention.

 

“Master, I appreciate your concern, but I assure you I am fine. There’s no need to worry.”

 

“To me, this isn’t even a concern, Madam.”

 

“But…”

 

“Consider it my kindness before you resign.”

 



 

“Our meeting here is fate, after all.”

 

Fate.

 

Ulrich smirked, unwilling to listen to any objections. He unfolded a paper, savoring the word. It felt pleasant on his tongue.

 

He smiled quietly, a serene smile that subdued the fierce summer sun.

 



 

Giggles, giggles.

 

Listening to the children’s innocent laughter, Lisbell leaned back. She sat on an old bench, the only shaded area behind the orphanage. Recently, the summer had deepened, causing sweat to pour out just by standing outside for a moment.

 

“Oh…!”

 

Something touched her cheek as she sat absentmindedly.

 

Startled, she straightened to find Theodore, who had been playing with the children, approaching. He held a reddish flower and smiled brightly.

 

“You scared me. What’s with the flower?”

 

“It’s a trumpet vine. I brought it to show you since it bloomed inside.”

 

Theodore sat beside her and placed the flower behind her ear, making her laugh. He then gently touched her forehead.

 

“How do you feel?”

 

“Much better.”

 

“Still, you should rest today. There’s no need to push yourself.”

 

Hesitating, Lisbell took his hand from her cheek and shook her head, indicating she was fine.

 

She knew why he was worried.

 

Since returning from Marnia, Lisbell had been ill for a week.

 

It started with muscle pain. Seeing Theodore at the train station, her tension melted away, and her whole body ached. Every step felt heavy and painful.

 

Back at the orphanage, she developed a fever. Her body rebelled, realizing it was finally home.

 

For days, she suffered a severe fever, her white skin blooming with heat rashes.

 

Theodore took care of her devotedly, cooling her with cold hands, wiping her sweat, and holding her when she felt nauseous.

 

After a week of care, she recovered. By then, the wound inflicted by Ulrich had also improved. Luckily, Theodore thought she had a simple fever.

 

“I should inform Madam. She was very worried about you.”

 

After three days of fever, when she could finally speak, Lisbell answered Theodore’s pressing questions.

 

The events in Marnia were just a misunderstanding, she said.

 

Everything was resolved.

 

Her mother was safe.

 

There were no problems….

 

Half-truths and half-lies.

 

When she finished, Theodore hugged her tightly. In his arms, she vaguely realized it was more about convincing herself than him.

 

Feeling his gentle touch, Lisbell sensed her heart pounding with foreboding.

 

A heavy burden had settled in her heart.

 

She now had a secret she could never share with Theodore.

 

Ulrich’s presence had changed everything. Now, she had something to hide from Theodore.

 

She returned to Misley longing for his warmth, but every embrace made her anxious. The burden in her heart grew.

 

“The weather is so hot; it must be uncomfortable not tying your hair.”

 

Theodore tucked her grey hair behind her ear, his touch lingering on her exposed white neck. The sensation made Lisbell flinch.

 

“I-it’s fine. This much is okay.”

 

But the evidence of what she tried to hide remained.

 

The bruise on her neck.

 

The scarf Ulrich had given her had hidden it from her mother. But she had thrown it away the moment she left the villa, unable to bear it.

 

So, Theodore saw the bruise. She blamed it on a fall, but even she knew it was a weak excuse. Her poor condition had deflected further questions.

 

“Lisbell, by any chance….”

 

Theodore began to speak after a moment of silence.

 

Thud, roll.

 

Something rolled to Lisbell’s feet.

 

A bright red apple. 


Chapter 35.


A round shape cast a long shadow behind it.

 

Lisbell held her breath.

 

It had been like this ever since she started seeing those dismal shadows. After witnessing someone’s cruel nature in the shadows that must form as brilliantly as the afternoon light, she often found herself like this.

 

“Lisbelli”

 

A girl with short hair and a petite frame, Mary, suddenly appeared. The world that had momentarily stopped for Lisbell resumed its normal pace.

 

Mary picked up an apple that had rolled to Lisbell’s feet and held it out to her.

 

“It’s a fallen fruit.”

 

Lisbell blinked and then laughed.

 

“Is this for me?”

 

“Yesi”

 

“Thank you. But weren’t we all harvesting together? What if you get scolded later for giving this to me secretly?”

 

Behind the orphanage, there was a small garden and a modest apple orchard. The apples were used for the children’s education, for their meals, and were even sold at the market near the port.

 

Teachers and children had gathered here early in the morning to harvest the ripe apples. Lisbell had come out to experience the bustle firsthand.

 

“Well, the teacher said this was a fallen fruit, so it’s not needed.”

 

“Ah…”

 

Lisbell looked at the fruit in Mary’s hand. Mary, clinging to her knee, asked,

 

“Hey, Lisbell, what’s a fallen fruit?”

 

“It’s a fruit that falls from the tree before it’s harvested.”

 

“I see. But why isn’t it needed?”

 

“Well… When a fruit falls to the ground, it gets bruised or dirty, so its value decreases.”

 

Though she explained it logically, Lisbell also found it hard to understand. Looking around, the apple only had some dirt on it, and seemed otherwise fine.

 

But to think its market value dropped just because it fell before proper harvesting.

 

It seemed unfair to the fruit, which probably didn’t fall on purpose. Lisbell rubbed the apple’s surface with her sleeve, revealing a transparent red hue.

 

“Thanks. Even if it’s a fallen fruit, it’s a precious gift to me.”

 

“Really?”

 

She patted Mary’s head as the girl, with a flushed face, asked again. Mary, who had been chattering while leaning on Lisbell’s knee, dashed off as soon as she heard someone calling her from afar.

 

Lisbell looked down at her knee where the child’s warmth had vanished. An apple and a single trumpet creeper blossom lay neatly on it.

 

“Do you like it that much?”

 

“Huh?”

 

“You couldn’t take your eyes off it.”

 

“Just…”

 

Looking at it brought her peace. Her turbulent mind calmed, and the inexplicable anxiety subsided. Perhaps it was the warmth she had always felt in Misley.

 

So, is this my sanctuary?

 

As Lisbell toyed with the vibrant red petals, she glanced to the side.

 

“By the way, wasn’t there something you wanted to say earlier?”

 

“Oh.”

 

He awkwardly scratched the back of his neck.

 

“Well… I was wondering if something happened in Marnia.”

 

The hand playing with the petals stopped.

 

“Since you came back, you seem to be in a daze more often.”

 

“…Nothing happened.”

 

“Really? Maybe it’s just travel fatigue since you had to rush back and forth. The distance between the two regions is quite significant.”

 

“Yeah, probably.”

 

Her mind seemed to short-circuit for a moment.

 

She couldn’t think about what expression she was making or how it might look to Theodore.

 

“Theo, sorry if I made you worry.”

 

“It’s finei We’re about to get married, so it’s natural for me to take care of you.”

 

“…Right.”

 

“Wow, time really flies. It feels like just yesterday when we told the director together. Don’t you think so?”

 

Looking up at the sky, Theodore reminisced as he pushed her long hair back and stroked her cheek. His hand felt warmer than before.

 

No, her skin had cooled that much.

 

Or perhaps it was her heart….

 

“Anyway, we can’t fall behind the kids. I’ll join in and finish quickly. Lisbell, if it gets too hot, don’t push yourself and go rest insidei”

 

Lisbell watched Theodore’s lithe figure as he shouted and dashed off. All that remained was the pounding of her heart.

 

As she stood there, she noticed a crushed flower petal. The wrinkles from being squished looked grotesque. She couldn’t even remember when it had ended up in such a state.

 

That was the problem.

 

Her sanctuary had started to crack.
