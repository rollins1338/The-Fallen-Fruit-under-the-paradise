The cold sound of rain was slicing through her ears. The continuous noise felt like his sneering, poking at her nerves.

 

Her body shivered uncontrollably. He was always an enigma, but he had never instilled such intense fear in her as he did today. The moment she recognized him, Lisbell’s lips parted.

 

“I’m… sorry.”

 



 

“I’m sorry, I…”

 

Ulrich, who hadn’t spoken a word since getting out of the car, raised an eyebrow. Soon, he took a leisurely step forward.

 

Even the splashing sound was elegant. No matter how much rain poured down, it couldn’t leave a mark on him. The man, who seemed invincible, bent down in front of the sunken Lisbell.

 

The black umbrella tilted slightly.

 

“What is it?”

 

For a moment, she thought the rain had stopped. And it had, indeed, stopped.

 

Thanks to Ulrich tilting the umbrella towards her.

 

“Speak.”

 



 

“What are you sorry for?”

 

It seemed lenient, but it wasn’t. His soft voice was laden with reproach.

 

What was she doing here?

 

Was she trying to run away?

 

Did she dare to do such a thing?

 

In his brief questions, sharp implications floated.

 

Lisbell lowered her head. Her face was drenched, and she couldn’t tell if it was from tears or rain. Ulrich watched her silently before glancing away.

 

“Is this the time to keep your mouth shut?”

 



 

“Your mother doesn’t seem to have much time.”

 

Her body flinched as if pricked by needles.

 

Her terrified eyes turned towards her mother, leaning against the tree.

 

She looked like a corpse, unmistakably so to any passerby. The feeling of her heart being twisted and plummeting to the ground from earlier came back vividly.

 

It was the worst. Lisbell bit her lip.

 

“Please, save her.”

 



 

“I’m sorry. It’s all my fault…”

 



 

“So please, save my mother, please…”

 

She couldn’t even lift her face as she pleaded desperately. Now she could distinguish between tears and rain. The tears, seeping from her scraped insides, were hot enough to burn.

 

She couldn’t deny that it was a very faint thread of relief.

 

What kind of relief, though, she didn’t know. She couldn’t understand.

 

Perhaps it was simply the relief of being able to save her mother. Or perhaps, deeper down, it was a vile pardon for the humanity she momentarily lost.

 

A large palm cupped the back of her head.

 

Lisbell was drawn into his arms without any resistance. Even though she could escape the rain and be embraced, she felt nothing but an ominous foreboding.

 

“Lisbell, having too many thoughts when you’re naive leads to this.”

 



 

“You always make the situation worse.”

 

Lisbell’s eyelids quivered. It was a weak movement, like the last struggle of a butterfly caught in a spider’s web. No matter how she struggled, she couldn’t escape.

 

At some point, the invisible trap started layering itself around her, without her even knowing.

 

“In such cases, not thinking at all is also a way.”

 

Grip.

 

She felt the force gripping her hair. The gesture, now revealing its claws, carried a refined warning.

 

“Don’t do anything foolish.”

 



 

“Just stay still…”

 

No matter how much she struggled, she didn’t feel her feet properly land anywhere.

 

Just swaying this way and that. Her senses were completely disarrayed, similar to a feeling of floating.

 

Only then did she realize.

 

What she had been doing all along.

 

Oh, I am… falling.

 



 

A needle was inserted into her thin arm.

 

While watching the liquid being injected, Ulrich glanced at the contract in his hand.

 

“Young master, it is done.”

 

The doctor attending to Mrs. Osborne adjusted his glasses and reported. Only then did Ulrich turn his head straight.

 

“Is she safe?”

 

“Yes. Her body temperature dropped considerably, but it wasn’t for a long time, so she’ll recover with sufficient rest.”

 

“No side effects or anything?”

 

“No. It wasn’t a treatment likely to cause side effects in the first place… You had asked to adjust the medication so she could wake up for an hour or two on the day you returned from the capital. It’s like she woke up from a long sleep briefly and then fell asleep again.”

 

“Good job. There are doctors in Laurent who have difficulty even with that, but you seem to manage well.”

 

When Ulrich finished speaking, Victor, who had been standing by, took out a notebook and wrote something. The doctor, recognizing it as a check issued only by the Altahart family bank, swallowed hard. It was an item valuable enough just to possess, with gold edges.

 

“You flatter me. Shall we proceed with the same treatment as before starting tomorrow?”

 

“Yes.”

 

“To keep her in a state of continuous sleep.”

 

At the confirming tone, Ulrich just nodded slightly. Meanwhile, Victor handed the doctor a check with the pre-determined amount. The doctor accepted it with great gratitude.

 

“A capable doctor like you should have been by my brother’s side.”

 

“Haha, it wasn’t such a difficult request. If you ever need my services again, please feel free to call me anytime.”

 

It seemed the doctor thought it was just flattery. Though sincere, Ulrich didn’t want to emphasize it too much, so he just gave a suitable smile. After his duty, the doctor left the bedroom.

 

Ulrich walked quietly to the bed. Lying on it was a woman with a complexion that seemed fragile enough to shatter.

 

Just as the doctor said, it was a minor medication adjustment, barely a small trick. Seeing her struggling even with that made it seem like staying alive was a miracle in itself.

 

Indeed, Ulrich was a little surprised. When he got out of the car, he was momentarily speechless because Mrs. Osborne, leaning against the tree, looked like she had just died.

 

She still had a role to play.

 

He couldn’t let something useful die meaninglessly. The intention was always to instill a deep sense of guilt in Lisbell, not to sever all her ties.

 

He had ordered Mrs. Osborne to wake up from her quiet sleep just in time for his return from the capital for this reason.

 


The presence of her mother was somewhat of a hindrance, but Ulrich wanted a more certain shackle than that.

 

Emotions can sometimes be intense, but they can also become as thin as paper. If Lisbell’s sense of responsibility towards her bedridden mother became that thin, and if she decided to run away leaving her behind…

 

There might come a time when he could accept that fact calmly, but it wasn’t now.

 

For now, he wanted to watch over her a little longer.

 

The result was as expected but still brought a sense of relief. What happened to Lisbell today ended up chaining her with a shackle she could never remove herself. Her gloomy appearance and the somber look she had while sitting down in the pouring rain were proof of that.

 

“Transfer the lady to the hospital as soon as a room is secured in the capital.”

 

Ulrich said, tearing the paper he was holding. The word ‘Repayment Contract’ written at the top split into two. Soon, the paper was shredded beyond recognition and discarded to one side.

 

“Immediately? Do you need to move so urgently?”

 

“My impatient mother will soon issue a summons.”

 

“A summons?”

 

“Have you seen Gwen’s condition?”

 

“No. There’s a strict no-entry order except for family.”

 

“He looks like he could die tomorrow.”

 



 

“That’s why she must be anxious.”

 

Victor sighed as if he understood now.

 

A summons was a unique authority held by the head of the Altahart family, requiring any family member to return immediately to the main residence in the capital, regardless of their location. Failure to comply could result in the legal recovery of their business management rights by the head.

 

For an Altahart who established their position through management rights within the family, this was a significant loss. The only way to avoid it was to comply with the summons.

 

What Ulrich intended to do now was to prepare to avoid being caught in such a situation.

 

Wait a minute…

 

If that was true, how far ahead had he planned?

 

Victor, who was closest to Ulrich’s orders, knew that he had instructed the doctor to adjust the medication. He also knew that this was a means to completely bind the woman who had ended up stuck in this villa.

 

And this method was coincidentally leading to an easy resolution of future situations.

 

The bait Ulrich chose to tie Lisbell’s feet to this place was Mrs. Osborne. Judging by his recent actions, it was clear that Ulrich intended to take her to the capital.

 

Lisbell wasn’t staying with him because she liked him. She was only staying because of a deal involving her mother.

 

Such a woman wouldn’t willingly follow Ulrich to the capital. If he took her mother, she would resist in some way, causing significant problems in trivial matters.

 

But…

 

But would she do that now?

 

Surely this wasn’t part of the plan either.

 

Ulrich had no idea about Gwen’s condition until he visited the capital, so he couldn’t have anticipated that an anxious lady would issue a summons soon.

 

So, it’s just a coincidence…

 

Even if it was true, it was astonishing. It could only be described as a stroke of remarkable luck. In the world, luck was often referred to as a moment blessed by the gods. Otherwise, it was an inexplicable event.

 

A man who not only was born talented but also received the love of the gods.

 

“Yes, I will proceed as soon as possible.”

 

Victor, who responded in a firm voice, secretly offered sincere consolation to Lisbell.

 

Leaving Victor behind, Ulrich walked down the long hallway.

 

The only sound was his footsteps echoing through the quiet space. Having just returned from the noisy capital, he finally felt a sense of relief.

 

The noise was bearable for a day or two, but Lorraine’s chaos was exceptional.

 

Well, what can I do? It’s a world where various information and gossip are fascinating and profitable.

 

In such a peaceful scenery surrounded by nature, you can’t feel the same pure excitement, malice, and proportional pleasure that oscillates.

 

Thinking about returning to that gloomy paradise made his head throb. The fatigue he had temporarily forgotten while staying here would soon resurface, flooding him with its waves.

 

But his thoughts soon took a slight turn.

 

Even in such a dreary place, would things change if he took Lisbell with him?

 

Would it feel different?

 

This was something he was curious about.

 

Despite thinking it was nonsense, he couldn’t help but wonder if his life in the vibrant yet desolate capital would change with just one different person by his side.

 

The curiosity that sprouted like a small bud quickly grew as big as a fist. Before he knew it, Ulrich was determined to take her to the capital no matter what.

 

By then, he had already reached Lisbell’s bedroom.

 

He knocked briefly and opened the door.

 

Lisbell was sitting on the bed. Her hair, dried and stuck together messily, and her clothes, still damp and clinging to her, suggested she had been forcibly brought here.

 

Her feelings weren’t far off.

 

Why else would she sit down in the rain without even thinking of getting up? It was a clear sign that she didn’t want to return to this villa.

 

“Lisbell.”

 





There was no response to his call. Ulrich approached the bed and looked at her face.

 

Even though she was indoors, sheltered from the storm, Lisbell’s eyes still looked like a wandering stone in the storm.

 

“If you stay like this, you’ll catch a cold.”

 

There was no response again, but he didn’t expect one in the first place. So, as he spoke, Ulrich was already turning around.

 

He grabbed a towel from the attached bathroom.

 

By the time he returned to the bed, Lisbell hadn’t moved an inch. Ulrich placed the towel on her head and roughly wiped away the remaining moisture.

 

He suddenly smiled.

 

He remembered Lisbell’s eyes, staring at him helplessly from the dark forest path. Eyes like a lost child. A vulnerable side he rarely saw in the always steadfast Lisbell. Eyes that clearly showed her shaken instincts.

 

Ulrich quietly tucked away his silent laughter and grabbed Lisbell’s hair along with the towel. As he lifted her head, her face followed limply.

 

He left a light kiss on her bloodless, pale lips. He thought she might frown, but Lisbell remained still. It was as if her soul had a crack that couldn’t be filled.

 

But even this wasn’t pleasing. He didn’t know what she was thinking. Whether empty or not, he wanted to dig into her piece by piece. Feeling a crude impulse, Ulrich threw the towel onto the bed.

 

Then he grabbed Lisbell’s wrist and pulled her up.

 

“It’s better to warm up a bit more.”

 

He led her limp, half-melted body into the bathroom.

 

Standing her under the hose, he turned the faucet, and water poured out refreshingly. Unlike the rain outside, it soon turned warm and steamy.

 

He couldn’t understand. Even though it was clear that going outside would leave her chewed up by the rain, why did she insist on going out?

 

He couldn’t fundamentally understand why she would reject a place where everything was provided, like this warm water flowing out on its own.

 

He thought he knew the answer without hearing it.

 

It was probably because of the love or whatever she had mentioned herself. No matter how many times he thought about it, it was an absurd sentiment.

 

Ulrich embraced Lisbell’s waist from behind. Then he started unbuttoning her blouse one by one.

 

It was only then that her slender body, as if waking up, slightly recoiled and curled her shoulders.




She had no idea that all her struggles only resulted in pressing closer against Ulrich’s chest. If she had the presence of mind to realize this, she wouldn’t have been dragged to the bathroom in the first place.

 

Ulrich chuckled and resolutely unbuttoned her blouse.

 

The front slowly opened. However, Lisbell’s resistance did not intensify. Instead, her body, gradually exposed, trembled slightly. The sudden chill hit her as the only layer of clothing was removed.

 

With only her underwear left, she was pushed into the warm water. Although the water stream wasn’t strong, Lisbell wobbled. Ulrich held her and adjusted the faucet. His shirt also became soaked in places.

 

He brushed her tangled hair to one side. Water droplets ran down her pale, smooth skin.

 

Without hesitation, Ulrich licked it.

 

He knew it had no taste, but he did it anyway. Sometimes, with her, his brain acted as if it was partly damaged, imagining it tasted like ripe fruit juice. He instinctively placed his tongue on it.

 

Lisbell flinched as if pricked by a thorn at the touch on her shoulder. Ulrich straightened his head after a few more licks and made sure her body could regain warmth. He rubbed the water all over her, and when some parts were hard to reach, he used his cupped hand to pour water directly.

 

Lisbell’s trembling gradually subsided.

 

Ulrich, who had been persistently rubbing her protruding shoulder blades, softly whispered to her back, which was facing the wall.

 

“Come with me to the capital.”

 

There was a reaction after a brief moment. Lisbell’s fingers, which were touching the wall, curled.

 

“Why the capital….”

 

Her voice, heard for the first time since entering her bedroom, was hoarse. It was so dry that even these many water droplets couldn’t wet it.

 

Ulrich turned off the faucet. The water stream gradually died down and eventually stopped. However, her enticing skin was still covered with beads of water.

 

He bent his head toward her seemingly pristine shoulder line and answered her tiny question while hugging her deeply from behind.

 

“I have something to do in the capital.”

 



 

“I can’t leave you alone in this villa while I’m gone.”

 

He spoke as if caring for her, but his intentions were different. He still found her interesting and planned to torment her even while taking her to the capital.

 

As his sly curiosity, which he hadn’t satisfied, seeped into his elegant tone, cold sweat dripped down Lisbell’s back like water droplets.

 

Ulrich slyly licked his way up from her shoulder to her neck, kissing and sucking. Every time his lips felt wet, he swallowed as if it were her bodily fluids, thinking it truly tasted that way.

 

“In the capital, Mrs. Osborne can receive much more precise and thorough treatment.”

 



 

“The medical facilities and equipment there are far superior to here.”

 

Ulrich grasped her chin, which had been staring blankly at the wall, and turned her to face him.

 

He engulfed her pale lips, which stood out red against her pallor. After lightly probing inside with his tongue, he slowly pulled back, making the saliva stretch, and murmured while looking into her eyes.

 

“If Lisbell just follows me, you won’t have to worry about the treatment costs.”

 

There was a long silence. But it didn’t feel like a bad sign.

 

If it were the old Lisbell, she would have stubbornly refused to go to the capital, flaunting her pride.

 

Perhaps the reason she couldn’t do so now was that the unfortunate situation she encountered today, while taking her sick mother out, kept replaying in her mind.

 

Though her constant resistance was attractive, her compliance now wasn’t bad either. It was pleasing not to have to repeat unnecessary words multiple times.

 

Using her mother as a pretext to break her bamboo-like spirit once was a good move. Even if that spirit rose again, it was beneficial for him now, as it made it easier to take her to the capital.

 

To seal the deal, Ulrich turned her body to face him and said,

 

“Lisbell, all you have left is your mother now.”

 

He smoothly removed her thin underwear clinging to her naked body. Her breasts, neatly gathered, drew his gaze.

 

Gazing lasciviously for a while, he then pressed and rubbed her nipple with his fingers, emitting a slightly excited tone.

 

“So, you must prioritize your mother.”

 

The voice urging her to grow guilt was deceitful, even to him.

 

Ulrich chuckled and lowered his head. He sucked her nipple into his mouth, including the areola.

 

Lisbell’s body stiffened as he sucked hard enough to make his cheeks hollow. The rigidity of her body, which had begun when he licked her shoulder, intensified his arousal.

 

Her resistance always fueled his desire. It evoked pure pleasure, as if he were crushing the neck of something alive. Though already erect, he felt he could get even harder, eager to explore every part of her thoroughly.

 

Was lust always this destructive?

 

Perhaps. He never put in as much effort or received such a deep impression from anyone else as he did with Lisbell. Savoring the red, ripe nipple with his mouth, Ulrich’s hand moved downward.

 

“…Ah.”

 

A barely audible moan escaped Lisbell’s lips.

 

Ulrich’s fingers slid into the moist triangle between her legs. Despite the rapid progression, her hole was already moist, thanks to the flowing water.

 

Ulrich spread his palm wide, rubbing her tangled pubic hair before thrusting his long middle finger deep into her hole.

 

“Only three days.”

 

“Ah….”

 

“And it’s already this tight? Hm?”

 

He teasingly added his index finger and scratched the inner walls. Her hole, forced to swallow two thick fingers, widened and wrinkled.

 

Ulrich enjoyed the texture of her pubic hair, spreading his palm and striking down. The droplets of water that soaked her pubic hair splashed in response to the rapid movements.

 

“Haha, it splashes just like Lisbell’s fluids.”

 

“Ah, ung…!”

 

“I wish you’d get this wet quickly. There’s nothing more satisfying than having you soak my lower part with your fluids….”

 

As his fingers flipped her tender insides, Lisbell leaned against the bathroom wall, trembling. Her lower body convulsed, sucking his fingers.

 

Noticing she was getting aroused faster than he expected, Ulrich glanced down.

 

“Ung, haah.”

 

Lisbell occasionally stood on her tiptoes, unable to hide her reactions. It happened every time his palm rubbed her pubic hair. Each time he touched the densely packed area, she displayed her sensitivity without restraint.

 

Confirming his assumption, Ulrich pressed his palm firmly against her pubic area. He applied pressure, rotating it in circles, and her lower abdomen tensed. Her toes curled, scratching the floor.

 

Ulrich raised an eyebrow, realizing something and letting out a small exclamation.

 

“Come to think of it, this is where most women feel pleasure.”

 

He withdrew his fingers, now slightly moist from her fluids.

 

Taking his hand to her pubic hair, he disturbed the sparse forest and spread her flushed labia wide. His fingers quickly found the prominent nub.

 

“Ugh…!”

 

“Is this the spot you love to have rubbed?”

 

“Ah, uh… hng, yes…!”

 

Her clitoris, the source of her pleasure, was mercilessly rubbed. As he pinched, scratched, and twisted it, Lisbell squirmed, her whole body shuddering, her cries echoing through the bathroom.

Ulrich’s sly smile deepened as he felt his palm, covering her groin, becoming steadily wetter, in stark contrast to her physical resistance. His eyes gleamed with a sinister interest, reflecting an almost maniacal shine against the bathroom’s light.

 

“Haa, haah, ugh…!”

 

Desperate to pull away, Lisbell gripped his forearm, but it was futile. Every time his fingertips lingered on her clitoris, as if to leave a mark, her knees weakened and her insides tingled sharply. The sensation of every nerve pulsing throughout her body was so sensitive it was almost terrifying.

 

Ulrich watched Lisbell, weakly clutching his arm, before suddenly lowering himself.

 

“…Hmp!”

 

His fine platinum hair brushed against her groin.

 

Lisbell was so startled by him bringing his mouth below her that she couldn’t even breathe.

 

Meanwhile, Ulrich licked the wetness from her pubic hair before spreading her flesh wide in one swift motion.

 

In the center, a modestly engorged nub was gently protruding.

 

Lisbell’s thighs trembled as he flicked it with the tip of his sharp tongue. He then enveloped it with his lips, sucking it as if to consume it. Fluids gushed from her now slippery entrance.

 

Ulrich savored the rich taste from the traces around his nose and mouth. The scent, too lewd, made part of his mind deliriously insane, numbing all his senses.

 

“Ah! Hmph, ah… no, no…”

 

Lisbell shook her head frantically, her body convulsing as if in a fit. Yet each time Ulrich bit her clitoris as if to chew it, she swallowed her breath and shuddered. The nature of the sensation became clear from the torrent of fluids that followed.

 

Ulrich, now with his eyes closed, suckled her clitoris thoroughly as if kissing it. What was once too small to find without parting the flesh quickly swelled up after a few licks.

 

As if praising him, Lisbell curled her waist in resistance as he delicately worked his tongue.

 

“Hah, stay still…”

 

He was engrossed in her reactions, almost captivated, but her constant struggling began to irritate him.

 

It was as if she despised feeling pleasure from him. Once in a daze like an idiot, now she vibrantly resisted. This irked him.

 

“Ah!”

 

Ulrich grabbed her wrist and pulled her down. He caught her collapsing body and laid her on the cold bathroom floor.

 

He briefly glanced at her small, hardly shaking breasts before spreading her groin wide while she was still dazed.

 

Diving in, he pressed his lips back to her clitoris, sucking it deeply, causing her calves to tense up.

 

Her half-bent legs hit Ulrich’s shoulders and back as he intrusively delved in. But he paid no mind, busy pressing his tongue against her clitoris and the crevice beneath it.

 

“Hah, haah, ung…!”

 

The overwhelming pleasure, mixed with discomfort, hit her. Each breath she took brought a slight convulsion, a tingling chill spreading through her abdomen. Each time, Lisbell’s breath caught.

 

It was a repulsive joy.

 

Pleasure that usually left her feeling raw now felt heavily subdued.

 

She felt despicable, writhing so lewdly despite having planned to abandon her mother and failing to save her from near death.

 

“Haha, you’re soaked.”

 

“Haah, haah…”

 

“Lisbell, you actually like it, don’t you?”

 

Her awkwardly floating ankles were grabbed, spreading her vulva so wide it couldn’t be hidden. His warm, throbbing shaft rubbed against her entrance.

 

The solid vein’s soft friction made her pulse with anticipation. Lisbell felt disgusted by her body’s reaction, hating herself for feeling it.

 

“Now, let’s… ngh…”

 

“Ah, ah…!”

 

The tip, lightly stained, spread her opening wide as it penetrated. The largest part soon followed, pushing in deeply, causing her hips to curl inward.

 

“You welcome it, don’t you… haah… right?”

 

Ulrich, interpreting her body’s treacherous response in his own way, gripped her legs like reins.

 

“So let’s enjoy this. There’s no grand meaning to sex to always… making a face like you’re being dragged to hell.”

 

“Hmph, ugh…!”

 

“Ah, inside you feels really good… haa….”

 

He tilted his head back, platinum hair rustling wetly as it fell behind his forehead.

 

His closed eyes mirrored pure lust.

 

Unlike his demeanor, her insides welcomed him, growing wetter by the moment. It was a sensation that made it impossible not to thrust.

 

He pounded without hesitation. His shirt clung to his back like a rider’s, revealing his lewd hip movements. Wet slaps echoed as they collided below.

 

“Hah, haah, ugh…!”

 

Lisbell’s eyes widened at the constant scraping sensation inside, hastily covering her mouth. Even so, fragments of trembling moans escaped her lips.

 

Soon, a sharp thought pierced her mind.

 

Ah, maybe this is my punishment.

 

Being pinned and pounded by a man she didn’t want, who held her barely alive mother hostage, leaving her to cry and moan like an animal—this felt like a divine punishment for abandoning her humanity.

 

The entire time she sat in the bedroom, guilt consumed her. Watching her mother, who had lived only for her, dying while she stood helpless on the forest path twisted and wrung out her spirit.

 

She desperately wanted to say something to alleviate this guilt, but the reality that even that was out of reach drove her mad.

 

In the midst of this, sex with him became a tiny escape. Despite being revolting, horrific, and dreadful, it was the only way her blocked breath found release.

 

Receiving this punishment seemed to somewhat ease the deep-seated guilt inside her.

 

So now, I am being punished….

 

“I told you, don’t think.”

 

“…Ung, haah…!”

 

“Now is the time to focus on your mother’s recovery.”

 

“Huh, mm… mmph…!”

 

“Lisbell, you’re a good daughter. So… ugh, you need to come with me to the capital.”

 

The thoughts that had risen like black water quickly receded.

 

An empty mind felt weightless.

 

Swaying. Like a straw doll on the cold ground, her body shook without any will. Her hand, which had been covering her mouth, slowly fell to the floor.

 

Somewhere, the sound of gunshots echoed. The wetness soaking her knees felt like someone’s tears.

 

Even amid this, her tightness greeted his thrusts with warmth, feeling it obscenely and honestly moaning.

 

The moans of someone lost trailed off into the air. Even though it was her own voice, it barely reached her ears. With reality fading away, the only vivid thing was the sinister gleam in the eyes looking down at her.

 

“Do you understand?”

 

His voice demanding an answer struck her ears like bullets. With her heart already riddled with holes, Lisbell mumbled in response.

 

She couldn’t tell what she said, but when she saw him smirk the next moment, she guessed it was what he wanted.


The capital, Laurent, was peaceful.

 

That was until a single scoop leaked from the Altahart family.

 

Before dawn one morning, a brief one-line report received from a related party started the commotion.

 

All the newspapers in Laurent replaced their planned articles with this new report, filling their front pages by the early hours of the morning.

 

A family photo of the Altahart family was used on the front page. Some newspapers only featured a small cutout of Gwen, the eldest son and heir.

 

Clink.

 



 

The small sound that rang in her ears woke Lisbell.

 

Lying on her side with her eyes open, she saw people moving quietly yet busily.

 

There was no need to look further. These were the servants working at the Altahart main estate.

 

Though it wasn’t the dining room, the smell of delicious food wafted through the air. The servants were gathered around a table near the bedroom.

 

Lisbell slowly got up. One of them must have sensed her presence, as they turned towards the bed and bowed. When one greeted her, the others followed suit like shadows. Then they quickly resumed their work.

 

“…Excuse me.”

 

Lisbell opened her mouth cautiously, waiting for the right moment.

 

Her voice abruptly cut off.

 

As soon as she spoke, they stepped back, gave a polite bow, and left the bedroom in an orderly line. Lisbell stared blankly at the space they had vacated.

 

She got up from the bed and approached the table where the servants had been gathered. As expected, it was lavishly set with food meant to be eaten in the bedroom.

 

She felt a bit disoriented.

 

While she was grateful she didn’t need to go down to the dining room to eat, she was also irritated by Ulrich’s attitude of treating her like a doll trapped in a dollhouse, giving orders to the servants.

 

Before sitting at the table, Lisbell headed to the bathroom. She cupped water in her hands and washed her face first. She did this to awaken her dulled senses since coming here.

 

But today, as usual, she didn’t feel refreshed even after several washes with cold water.

 

That was how dazed she felt.

 

The fact that she was staying at the Altahart mansion in the capital was always hard to grasp.

 

“…haah.”

 

The reality hit her constantly.

 

Even the towels here were much softer than the ones she once thought were luxurious in Marnia.

 

And not just that. Even the bathroom was excessively opulent, with golden decorations that sometimes made it blindingly bright under the sun. Even the faucets and the bathtub were gilded.

 

The bedroom wasn’t much different.

 

Famous paintings hung on the walls, marble vases adorned the tables, and crystal decanters decorated the drink tables.

 

Just being surrounded by such expensive items made her feel overwhelmed. Lisbell could never feel at ease in this room, constantly worried about damaging something valuable.

 

Of course, if asked if that was the only reason for her discomfort, the answer would be no.

 

As she headed to the table, something caught Lisbell’s eye. It was today’s newspaper, folded carelessly. She picked it up.

 

{Gwen Altahart Dies, Laurent Shrouded in Mourning}

 

It had been a week since she arrived in the capital. Even when she first got here, the state of this family was splashed across the front pages of the newspapers, and now it was the same.

 

Gwen Altahart’s fate had shocked many people unexpectedly.

 

As she tilted the newspaper, ashes that had gathered in one corner scattered softly. The family photo of the Altahart family, showing Gwen Altahart sitting solemnly, was marred by black ashes.

 

Ulrich received the newspaper every day and stubbed out his cigarette on his brother’s face.

 

She only realized that “the matter in the capital” Ulrich mentioned was his brother’s death after arriving here.

 

As she glanced at the densely written article, she read that they would be transferring the body to the church for the funeral today.

 

Lisbell folded the newspaper and set it down, then headed to the table. Sitting by the window, she could see outside clearly. Instead of picking up her fork, she first took a sip of milk while glancing outside.

 

It wasn’t raining, but the weather felt gloomy. It was because of the people gathered on the lush green lawn, all dressed in black. These were the members of Ulrich’s family.

 

The Altaharts.

 

Setting down the glass, Lisbell slowly picked up her fork. As she cut into the well-seasoned omelet, her eyes landed on something.

 

Her chewing slowed.

 

A child…

 

Among the towering adults, there was a child. Dressed all in black, the child looked like they were wearing raven feathers from head to toe.

 

Were they part of the family?

 

But as far as Lisbell knew, Gwen Altahart was unmarried. And Ulrich Altahart, of course, had no children. She hadn’t heard of or met any other siblings.

 

So who was that child?

 

The thought quickly passed as it wasn’t her concern.

 

Lisbell had come to the capital solely for her mother’s treatment.

 

When she was drowning in guilt, exposed by her own vile nature, Ulrich had made her an offer she couldn’t refuse.

 

No, was it really an offer?

 

It had felt more like a timely punishment, a threat.

 

Would she abandon her mother again?

 

The sharp threat that pierced her conscience, reminding her of her wicked intention to abandon her mother during the storm.

 

Lisbell had been powerless then, and Ulrich was as meticulous as ever. When she finally gathered her wits to protest, her mother had already been transferred to the capital hospital. The repayment contract set for autumn became meaningless. Her mother’s salvation, after almost dying in the storm, depended on the life-support treatment provided in the capital. To save her mother, she had no choice but to rely on him without regard for time or cost. Therefore, Lisbell had to quietly follow Ulrich.

 



 

It was while she was gripping her fork, tasting bitterness in her mouth.

 

Unbeknownst to her, Ulrich had looked up towards this side of the bedroom.

 

Even he couldn’t go against the custom of wearing mourning clothes. Dressed in a black shirt, different from his usual white, he wore a black tie that felt somewhat stiff.

 

Despite the distance, it was clear he was staring straight at her, stroking his tie as if he was sure their eyes had met.

 

Lisbell frowned and turned her head. Her appetite, already scarce, vanished entirely, and she put down her fork with a clatter.

 

Deliberately avoiding his gaze, she continued her meal, occasionally glancing outside. At some point, Ulrich had turned and was now holding the shoulder of a woman in a black hat with a short veil.

 

It was probably his mother.

 

Cora Altahart, the current head of the family.

 

Since arriving here, Lisbell had not encountered any of his family members. She had arrived in the dead of night and existed like a fish in a bowl in his bedroom.

 

She bit the inside of her cheek.

 

Naturally, she hadn’t met her mother either. Her mother was currently hospitalized in the Royal Capital Hospital, receiving treatment far superior to what she had in Marnia.

 

Yes, she had heard.

 

It was just indirectly obtained information.

 

Since bringing her here, Ulrich had kept her confined, not allowing her to go anywhere.


Of course, no physical measures were taken. 

 

Just a psychological burden was imposed.

 

“I hope you stay quiet for a while. Unless you want that pretty face of yours plastered all over cheap gossip magazines.”

 

“What does that mean…”

 

“With Gwen’s death, the media is overly focused. They’ve gathered from areas we can control to those we can’t. Yellow journalism tends to flare up passionately at times like these. I hear from the butler that the front gate is crowded with reporters carrying cameras. If you step outside or even peek out of the window, you might catch unnecessary attention as someone not in the family photo.”

 



 

“I don’t mind if rumors spread that you’re my hidden lover, but I think Lisbell would dislike that, so I’m telling you.”

 

“…Until when?”

 

“For now, it’s best to keep a low profile until we get through Gwen’s funeral safely.”

 

“What about my mother? How can I visit my mother?”

 

“There’s a family attendant guarding her hospital room to ensure immediate contact if anything happens. So, if anything serious occurs, we’ll be informed right away.”

 

“…What about me?”

 



 

“What should I do here?”

 

He gently brushed her hair back as she sat on the bed. His large palm soon covered her pale cheek.

 

“You just need to stay.”

 



 

“Do nothing, and stay still.”

 



 

“Didn’t I make it clear?”

 

It was a lie.

 

‘Do nothing’ wasn’t true.

 

Because his hand, which had been caressing her cheek, naturally slid down and spread Lisbell’s legs. It was just a role to relieve his lust.

 

Ultimately, until the mourning for his household that swept through the capital was settled, she too had to be restricted in her actions. Lisbell also refused to get further entangled with his household.

 

Just a week ago, she thought it was natural, but it was suffocating.

 

Not being able to meet her mother, the reason she was dragged to this unfamiliar capital, troubled her daily.

 

And today was the day of Gwen’s funeral, as he mentioned.

 

The family gathered in the courtyard would soon head to the church where the funeral would take place.

 

After that, perhaps she could escape this suffocating life a bit.

 

The feeling of being controlled, from her living space to her range of activity, under his grasp, was deeply unsettling. The special locks on the windows that couldn’t be opened without the servants’ help, the grand double doors, and the other wealthy items around her seemed like the bars of a dreadful cage.

 

She habitually scratched her neck.

 

There was nothing there, but it felt like it was tightening.

 

She scratched her skin with her nails.

 

She knew it wouldn’t change anything, but couldn’t stop by instinct.

 

The unconscious act finally stopped when she saw blood.

 

She wiped the stinging spot with her sleeve.

 

Seeing the small blood stain, Lisbell decided to talk to him as soon as he returned today.

 

Ulrich returned as the sun set and the moon rose.

 

Exhausted, he went straight to the bathroom upon entering the bedroom.

 

Lisbell sat on the bed, waiting silently until he finished his shower. It was the same position she always took when he returned from outings. She was sick of it, but had nowhere else to go. Anyway, since this was his domain, Lisbell felt uncomfortable whether here or there.

 

“Did you eat?”

 

He asked, coming out of the bathroom in a loosely tied robe.

 

Lisbell turned her head silently. Ulrich looked in the direction she indicated, where the table tray was placed. The food on the plate was mostly untouched.

 

“Still quite a bit left. You didn’t eat much yesterday either. No appetite?”

 

“How can I eat comfortably when my mother’s life is uncertain?”

 

Her tone was calm, but the content was biting. Recognizing this, Ulrich smirked and sat next to her. He grabbed her slender chin with his fingers.

 

“If your mother knew her daughter was refusing to eat because of her, she’d be upset.”

 

“…Is the funeral over?”

 

“Yes, finally. I feel like I’ve heard Gwen’s name a lifetime’s worth.”

 

“Then can I go outside now?”

 

“What happened to your neck?”

 

Ulrich suddenly asked, tilting her chin. His eyes, sharper than usual, scanned the area she had scratched earlier.

 

“Did you hurt yourself?”

 

“I scratched it a bit.”

 

“Why?”

 

“It was itchy.”

 

“Still itchy?”

 

“It’s fine now.”

 

Not expecting him to be so persistent, Lisbell was slightly taken aback. She tried to push his arm away, but he continued to stare intently at the spot. Shortly after, he called for a servant. Within less than a minute, an old butler with a long mustache knocked and entered.

 

“Pavil, bring some first-aid ointment.”

 

“Should I call a doctor?”

 

“No, it’s not that serious.”

 

“Yes, young master.”

 

Ignoring Lisbell’s protests that she was fine, Ulrich firmly applied the ointment to her neck. The sensation of the salve spreading felt strange and unexplainable.

 

“Hm, no licking your neck today after applying the medicine.”

 



 

“Is it safe for humans?”

 

If he was certain it was harmless, he seemed ready to lick even this medicated neck ravenously. Even with the servant still there, he didn’t hold back his words. Lisbell pushed his arm away and widened her eyes.

 

“Please answer my question first.”

 

“What was your question?”

 

“Now that the funeral is over, can I move around freely?”

 

“Hm.”

 

“I want to visit the hospital where my mother is.”

 

“There’s been no special news from the attendant.”

 

“I want to check with my own eyes.”

 

Ulrich gestured for the butler to leave.

 

Left alone in the bedroom, he lit a cigarette. Exhaling the smoke slowly, he brushed back his hair.

 

“Do you know what my brother’s death means?”

 

“…Not really.”

 

“My brother was the heir. With him gone overnight, what’s the next step?”

 



 

“I, as the second son, must take over the succession.”

 

“And what does that have to do with me?”

 

“I’d love to take you to the hospital, but I’ll be terribly busy starting tomorrow.”

 

“I didn’t ask you to come with me. I can go alone.”

 

He played idly with her messy hair.

 

“Do you know where to go?”

 

“If you tell me the hospital.”

 

“Do you think you can go alone?”

 

“There’s no reason I can’t.”

 

Sucking on his cigarette until his cheeks hollowed, he exhaled and laughed strangely.

 

“It’d be better if I went with you.”

 

“No… I’ll decline.”

 

“Always a fortress except when spreading your legs.”

 

His fingers crawled up her knee.

 

“What about clothes?”

 



 

“You can’t visit the hospital in a slip like this. Right?”

 

When coming to the capital, Lisbell’s clothes were discarded. More precisely, Ulrich disposed of them. Since arriving, she had only worn the slips and robes his secretary provided. It was true she couldn’t go out dressed like this.

 

“I can borrow the maids’ clothes.”

 

“That would be too pitiful.”

 

“…Are you trying to stop me from going?”

 

“Me? No way.”

 



 

“I’m just a bit sad.”

 

Ulrich tucked her gray hair behind her ear. He kissed her exposed cheek deeply.

 

“You won’t even consider my offer to go together.”

 

“I just want to see my mother immediately, and you said you’d be busy for a while.”

 

“Don’t pretend to care about me. You just don’t want to be with me.”

 

His intention, obvious though it was, was hard to understand. Well, when was he ever comprehensible? Still, he caressed her eye with an unreadable smile.

 

His fingers then touched her lips.

 

“Will you kiss me?”

 



 

“If you do, I promise to prepare clothes for tomorrow and a car to the hospital.”


Ulrich thrust his face forward as if to confront himself, and closed his eyes tightly. Crackle, crackle. In the quietness surrounding the bed, only the sound of the tobacco leaves he was holding burned. Lisbell stood still, facing his sharply visible face even in the dark.

 

With his eyes closed, Ulrich’s eyebrows twitched.

 

“Aren’t you going to do it?”

 

“What does this mean to you?”

 

“I enjoy seeing how much you despise it.”

 

Despite his closed eyes, Ulrich’s voice had a hint of laughter as if he could clearly see Lisbell’s face filled with disgust. Lisbell felt an urge to slap his cheek but didn’t want to complicate the situation by acting on it.

 

“Do it like you would for a fiancé.”

 



 

“Ah, now it’s ex-fiancé.”

 

“Ulrich.”

 

“I would love it if you included some tongue.”

 



 

“Hurry up.”

 

Lisbell clenched her fists tightly. She felt something wrapping around her neck again, which had just been treated. Her breathing became shallow, and her chest tightened. She wanted to scratch her neck wildly, knowing it wouldn’t help. It was an abnormal behavior caused by psychological erosion.

 

Just think about Mother.

 

It had already been a week since she last saw her mother. The vividness of the final memory was torturous. Her frail figure leaning against a tree as if dead, or before that, barely walking through the rain. No, before that… her mother, sincerely grieving and angry amidst many truths Lisbell confessed in desperation.

 

She shouldn’t have said anything.

 

She should have kept quiet and swallowed it down.

 

If she had… would things be different now?

 

It was a useless regret. Given the situation, Lisbell had to take responsibility for her mother until the end. So, she wanted to see her condition as soon as possible.

 

Holding onto this thought, Lisbell brought her lips to Ulrich’s. It was hardly a kiss, more like a mere contact.

 

She knew she had to act quickly to satisfy the vile man, but her uncomfortable state made it hard to think clearly. Her insides felt twisted in different directions. Initiating physical contact with him brought a dizzying feeling.

 

“…Mm…!”

 

Her body was pushed back. Ulrich, who had been still, suddenly embraced her waist. He chuckled between their joined lips.

 

“Still clumsy.”

 

“Ugh…”

 

“But cute, so I’ll let it slide.”

 



 

“It would be better if you came with me.”

 

“I can go alone.”

 

“Then suit yourself.”

 

As he climbed on top of her, he pulled up her slip. She didn’t even bother with underwear anymore since all she did here was have sex with him. Her bare groin was exposed.

 

Her body, accustomed to the intercourse, began to move slowly. Lisbell bit her lip, staring at the ceiling. The usual nausea-like sensation arose. The thought of seeing her mother tomorrow made it bearable.

 



 

Sunlight cutting through the bedding awakened the morning.

 

Lisbell opened her eyes slowly in a daze. Even after a while, there were no signs of anyone else. As he mentioned, he seemed to have left early for his busy schedule starting tomorrow.

 

Rising slightly, she noticed a dress hanging in the makeshift closet. It seemed to be the dress he had promised as a reward for the kiss. Throwing off the blanket, Lisbell quickly grabbed a gown and headed to the closet.

 



 

A white undershirt with a black ribbon and a plain black flared skirt, matching the ribbon.

 

Lisbell touched the blouse’s sleeve. The flowing material was undoubtedly silk, unlike her stiff shirts, which were soft and elegant.

 

Ulrich’s preparation was perfect. Inside the clothes, there were silk stockings and lace gloves, as if for a noblewoman. Feeling it was unnecessary, she omitted the gloves.

 

Seeing it confirmed it didn’t suit her, but with her clothes disposed of, she had no choice.

 

She couldn’t visit her mother in her slip dress from the bedroom, as Ulrich suggested.

 

While sighing, she noticed a note on the mantelpiece. It said to call a servant when she was ready. Unconsciously clutching the note, she looked around. Though he wasn’t there, it felt as if he was watching her every move, giving her chills.

 

She hesitated but pulled the bell rope to leave for the hospital quickly. After a moment, the door opened with a knock. It was the old butler, Pavil, who had brought the medicine yesterday.

 

“I plan to visit the hospital where my mother is admitted.”

 

“I have been instructed by the second young master. The car is ready, please follow me.”

 

Lisbell followed the butler, who treated her like a family member, feeling uneasy. Now she could finally take a proper look at the inside of the Altarhart estate. The first day she arrived, it was too foggy to see anything clearly, and she wasn’t in the mood to look.

 

The bedroom was luxurious, but seeing the hallway and other spaces, it seemed normal for such an estate. It made her understand how the Marniha villa could be merely a ‘villa.’

 

“The mansion is still in disarray despite the funeral of Master Gwen being over. To avoid drawing attention, we have arranged for you to leave through the back gate.”

 

The butler said as he opened the door to a luxurious car. His politeness felt excessive and made her feel sick, as if she had a special relationship with Ulrich.

 

Nodding slightly, she got into the car.

 

“Philip, the driver, will guide you once you arrive at the hospital.”

 

The door closed. The car moved, the gravel under the fountain crunching as the wheels rolled. The car quickly left the townhouse.

 

Entering the main road, the buildings around them grew larger.

 

The path along the calmly flowing river was unfamiliar.

 

The trees lining the streets were colorful, fitting for autumn, and the grand fountain beneath the majestic statue sprayed water high.

 

They passed a park with a central blue clock tower and scattered benches, and restaurants and coffee houses, preparing for business, opened their terraces early, creating a lively atmosphere.

 

After taking in the unfamiliar sights, the car stopped in front of a building.

 

“We’ve arrived.”

 

Philip, the driver, introduced himself and got out, leading the way. Following him, Lisbell quietly clenched her hands.

 

Had her mother woken up since arriving in the capital? If so, what did she remember? Did she remember trying to escape with her? Had her condition improved? Was it the same? The capital’s medical skills should be far better than those of a small town, but if there was still no improvement, what should she do…

 

Lost in thought, she noticed the surroundings had become eerily quiet. She looked up. This place felt different from the usual ward with patients and nurses.

 

In the distance, there was a double door. A woman sitting in front, handling paperwork, stood up sensing their approach.

 

Philip explained their visit. The woman, after a brief wait, went inside the double doors and soon returned. She looked around as if searching for someone.

 

“Did you come with Ulrich Altarhart?”

 

“No.”

 

“Then, unfortunately, visiting is not allowed.”

 

Lisbell was taken aback by the unexpected refusal. She opened her mouth to speak but only managed to stammer, not understanding.

 

“I’m here to see my mother.”

 

“Yes, I confirmed your purpose of visiting Helen Osborne.”

 

“But how can you deny a family member a visit…”

 

“I’m sorry, but visits are only allowed when accompanied by Ulrich Altarhart.”


I don’t know what kind of absurd situation this is. Feeling her mind heavy and tangled, Lisbell took a step towards the woman.

 

“I don’t understand. I am the family of the patient, not Mr. Altahart. So why can I only visit if he’s present?”

 

“That’s the policy.”

 

“What kind of policy?”

 

As she shot back the question, the woman glanced awkwardly at the double doors behind her.

 

“It won’t matter what you say to me. If you want to visit Helen Osborne, please accompany Mr. Ulrich Altahart.”

 

Even if she didn’t know exactly what was going on, one thing was clear: the woman had no intention of stepping aside. As despair began to engulf her mind, Lisbell suddenly remembered the conversation she had with Ulrich last night.

 

“It would be better if you go with me.”

 

“Still, it would be better if you go with me.”

 

Now she understood why the man had been so compliant. He had foreseen this. For some reason, he knew that she wouldn’t be able to see even a strand of her mother’s hair if she came to the hospital alone.

 

Lisbell pressed her lips together and looked past the woman at the double doors.

 

“Is my mother really in there?”

 

“Yes, she is registered as a patient.”

 

“Is she okay? Is there anything wrong with her?”

 

“I’m sorry, but I cannot disclose any information about the patient.”

 

Her stomach churned.

 

This wasn’t much better than when she was in Marnia. No matter how good the treatment, what good was it if she couldn’t verify it with her own eyes?

 

Though she was filled with self-reproach, that was all. No matter how she felt, the double doors remained firmly closed. There was only one way to open them: by coming with Ulrich.

 

With a bitter taste in her mouth, Lisbell had no choice but to leave the hospital.

 

Back at the mansion, having returned in the car driven by Philip, Lisbell was consumed by a sense of helplessness she had never felt before. Even during her time in Marnia, she often felt useless, but never as despondent as this.

 

It was because she kept feeling like she had made a terrible mistake.

 

The thought that her mother’s life was now completely in Ulrich Altahart’s hands filled her with a dizzying anxiety.

 

Despite being the sole guardian, she was denied visitation rights that were easily granted to him. The name thrust in front of her every time she tried to see her mother was Ulrich’s.

 

Is there any way out of this situation?

 

“…Ugh.”

 

Suddenly, she felt something stuck in her chest. Clutching her chest, Lisbell staggered and collapsed onto the edge of the bed. On the bed that was far too large for her frame, she curled up and scratched at her neck.

 

No matter how many times she clawed at her skin, the feeling didn’t go away. Gasping for breath like someone on the verge of death, she suddenly smelled a faint scent of blood.

 

She raised her trembling hand. There was cold blood caked under her nails. All sorts of troubling thoughts crowded in. Her mind became chaotic, like a messy sketchbook.

 

“When that happens, sometimes the best thing to do is not to think at all.”

 

Yet, she would lose all her strength in an instant, recalling those words that had been planted inside her like brainwashing.

 

Don’t think….

 

Is it really that I think too much?

 

Is that why my head hurts so much?

 

Lethargy gradually consumed her consciousness.

 

Lisbell wiped her hand on the pristine sheets. After repeating this several times, she closed her eyes. Severe exhaustion brought sleep to the brink. It felt like she was sinking into water.

 



 

A touch on her neck disturbed her sleep. Unlike in the morning, she didn’t furrow her brow. It was already night, with only a few lights dimly illuminating the dark surroundings.

 

At first, she only recognized the presence in front of her as a silhouette, but it soon became clearer.

 

“This makes the treatment feel pointless.”

 

Ulrich, fiddling with her neck, chided. Something sticky was applied as his hand moved. Then she realized he was applying ointment, just like the previous night.

 

Looking at him with eyes darkened by the night, she spoke in a slightly hoarse voice.

 

“I went to the hospital but couldn’t see my mother.”

 

“That’s why I told you. It’s better if you go with me.”

 

As expected, he wasn’t surprised at all.

 

“…Why didn’t you tell me?”

 

“Because I’ve experienced it myself.”

 

Ulrich, who had crouched beside the bed to match her height, turned slightly. Running low on ointment, he squeezed out some more. He applied it to her neck and leisurely met her gaze. His eyes, which blended into the dark atmosphere, were both beautiful and eerie.

 

“Lisbell, because you think too much, it’s faster for you to understand things by experiencing them.”

 



 

“If I had told you the truth, would you have believed me?”

 

He chuckled softly.

 

“No, you would have just gotten upset and made things difficult for me, like before.”

 

Lisbell clenched the blanket under her hand.

 

“…She’s my mother.”

 

“I know.”

 

“She’s my mother, so why can’t I see her?”

 

“That’s a bit off. It’s not that you can’t see her.”

 



 

“You can see her if I’m with you.”

 

“But I’m her guardian.”

 

“Ha, do you really think so?”

 

His laugh was forced. It was nothing more or less than a sneer.

 

That’s why Lisbell couldn’t accept even the touch of his hand treating her neck. She had read somewhere that one method of torture involves inflicting wounds, then treating them, and then wounding the same spot again. Perhaps he intended to torment her in that way.

 

“Now, I’m your mother’s guardian, Lisbell.”

 



 

“If I’ve saved her twice, I should at least be able to play that role, shouldn’t I?”

 

“…I want to see my mother.”

 

“Later.”

 

“Later when?”

 

“When my situation calms down.”

 



 

“Well, depending on how you behave, I might change my mind. I’m quite fickle, you know.”

 

“Behave…?”

 

“If you act nicely, I might make time for you.”

 

Not knowing exactly what he meant by acting nicely, but knowing that it would likely be something she could never willingly do given how he had tormented her in various ways, Lisbell looked at him with a sense of desolation. As he wiped his fingers smeared with ointment residue, he suddenly laughed.

 

“The clothes suit you better than I thought.”

 

There was a sticky satisfaction in his leisurely gaze. It was the exact opposite of her feelings, so she couldn’t help but speak her mind.

 

“I don’t think so.”

 

“If I want to take them off right now, they must suit you.”

 



 

“If I have time, should we go shopping for clothes together?”

 

“If we have time, it would be better to visit my mother first.”

 

Ulrich, who was still fully dressed in his business attire from tie to cufflinks, stood up.

 

“Let me just tell you that this attitude is not at all attractive.”

 

Taking off his jacket, Ulrich spoke.

 

“Shall we eat first? I heard from Pavel that you skipped meals all day. I haven’t eaten yet either. Let’s go down together; I’ll show you around the mansion.”

 

Lisbell slowly sat up. Although she wanted to stay in the room, realizing that her chance to see her mother depended on Ulrich made it difficult. Coupled with what he had just said, she had no choice but to get out of bed.

 

Although she wanted to walk as far away from him as possible, he held her waist as they moved, making it impossible. Practically leaning against him, she barely noted the locations of the study, the reception room, the indoor pool, and the terrace-attached tea room before arriving at their destination: the dining room.

 

Contrary to her expectation that it would be empty, as Ulrich had led her confidently, there were already people inside, illuminated by the chandelier’s light.

 

Two men and women. Lisbell hesitated as she saw them.

 

“Oh my, Mother.”

 

A beautiful woman with honey-blonde hair turned her head elegantly. Her eyes, exactly like Ulrich’s, looked this way—blue-gray, beautiful yet eerie.


Next to her sat a handsome man with captivating red hair. Though their relationship was unclear, the atmosphere was peculiar.

 

“I didn’t expect to see you here,” he said, while Lisbell boldly walked into the dining room she didn’t dare enter easily.

 

“It’s been so long since I saw you in the dining room. You always eat in your bedroom.”

 

Not only was he undeterred, but he also headed straight for the spot opposite the two seated individuals. A quietly appearing butler pulled out a chair for him, and he sat, sending a questioning glance towards Lisbell, who was still standing by the door.

 

Lisbell approached him hesitantly, as if walking on a thorny path, clutching her skirt.

 

“Didn’t you say that was a privilege exclusive to a lady?”

 

“It’s enough to enjoy such privileges in the bright morning. Staying in the bedroom until evening would make the servants see you as too lazy.”

 

The lady calmly responded to her son’s pointed remark, her gaze now fixed on the approaching Lisbell.

 

Lisbell felt suffocated under the scrutinizing stares of four floating blue-gray eyes. As soon as she sat on the chair the butler had pulled out, she met the lady’s piercing gaze. Despite its gentle color, it was sharp enough to make her spine tingle.

 

“Pavil, what are you doing?” Ulrich said, looking at the butler holding the decanter.

 

“You should send away uninvited guests who don’t belong here.”

 

There was no doubt who he was referring to—the handsome man with red hair sitting next to the lady.

 

“Uninvited guest? Are you referring to the unfamiliar young lady sitting next to you?” the lady pointedly remarked, her gaze still fixed on Lisbell.

 

“I’m talking about that leech who has no shame and flatters my mother,” Ulrich retorted, disparaging his mother’s lover. The atmosphere quickly turned tense. Despite four people being present, no one spoke, and the air grew heavy. Only the hosts of the house remained composed.

 

The lady sighed softly.

 

“If you want to discuss qualifications, I won’t stop you, but I wonder if you have the right to be so confident, Ulrich. I have never seen the young lady sitting next to you before. How should I interpret a stranger sitting in this mansion’s dining room?”

 

“Well, I think our perspectives are a bit different.”

 

“Different? How?”

 

“I’m single, but you’re married.”

 



 

“I’m not such an ungrateful son that I can look favorably on my mother’s lover who has shamelessly taken my father’s place.”

 

As the mother and son exchanged tense words, the food began to be served one by one. Lisbell held her breath in the heavy atmosphere, wondering if she could even eat in such a situation.

 

Ulrich, having casually sipped from his glass, narrowed his eyes at the handsome man across from him.

 

“You seem to be around for quite a while this time. What do you like so much about him?”

 



 

“Is it his good looks? His body? Or… is it because he’s more capable in bed than he looks?”

 

He wasn’t the type to get drunk easily after just one sip. Hence, his words were carefully considered, and in this sense, he was truly unrestrained. His tone was refined, but his words were enough to humiliate someone. The lady sighed again.

 

“Julian.”

 

The red-haired man responded promptly to the call.

 

“Yes, ma’am.”

 

“You should go upstairs now.”

 

With that one sentence, Julian stood up without hesitation. He bent over and kissed the back of the lady’s hand with a light smack. His actions seemed oddly frivolous, not weighted with genuine experience but rather like he was mimicking the nobility he had observed.

 

Julian, having finished his farewell to the lady, walked towards the door.

 

Before leaving, he exchanged a brief, unreadable glance with Lisbell, leaving a strangely uncomfortable impression as he exited.

 

“Now that Julian is gone, shouldn’t you also send her away?” the lady said.

 

“What do you mean?”

 

“I mean the young lady sitting next to you. Are you going to keep her here?”

 

“Even if I send her away, she needs to eat first.”

 

Ulrich responded indifferently, pulling a few plates toward Lisbell to encourage her to eat. He himself only sipped from his glass, causing Lisbell to feel nauseated.

 

It was inevitable that the lady, observing this from up close, would make a remark.

 

“I don’t know how you can be so selfish.”

 

“Indeed, I wonder who I take after,” Ulrich replied nonchalantly.

 



 

“It certainly doesn’t seem to be Father…”

 

The lady sighed, seemingly exasperated, and signaled the butler with her eyes. The approaching butler refilled her glass. The lady glanced at Lisbell, who was awkwardly forking her food.

 

“What’s your name?”

 

“Lisbell Osborne.”

 

“How do you know my son?”

 

“We met in Marnia.”

 

“…Ulrich. Is the young lady unable to speak for herself? Do you have to answer for her?”

 

Ulrich responded calmly to his mother’s pointed reprimand.

 

“She’s pregnant. I have to help her out.”

 

“…What?”

 

The lady’s shock quickly turned to confusion as Lisbell erupted in a fit of coughing. The bread piece she had been swallowing seemed almost to come back up as she stared wide-eyed at Ulrich.

 

He casually continued to slice her meat while smiling at her.

 

“I told you before, didn’t I? She’s pregnant.”

 



 

“With triplets.”

 

“Ulrich.”

 

“Aren’t you happy? You always said you wanted grandchildren soon. Now you have three at once. It’s a family blessing. It might even be a gift from Gwen.”

 

Ulrich, having effectively silenced his mother, went a step further and gently touched Lisbell’s stomach. Even though her belly was flat, his act was so convincing that even Lisbell momentarily wondered if she was indeed pregnant. After a brief reflection on their encounters, she knew it was impossible, as their intimate moments had mostly involved withdrawal.

 

Seeing Lisbell’s shocked expression, the lady quickly realized her son was spouting nonsense again.

 

As if to say more, she pursed her lips but deemed it pointless and rose from her seat. The butler helped adjust her shawl.

 

“Yes, I forgot that sometimes your stubbornness surpasses Gwen’s. My beloved son, you may know best, but make sure no rumors spread outside.”

 

“I will be as thorough as you, Mother.”

 

“I mean it. Did you not think to cover her neck when bringing her here?”

 

Lisbell hurriedly pulled her disheveled gray hair over her neck. Although it now covered her nape, it was too late.

 

“Remember, eyes are watching you.”

 

“Yes, have sweet dreams.”

 

“You don’t need to push me out.”

 

The lady, having sternly scolded her stubborn son, left the dining room, her heels clicking on the floor.

 

After the storm, an uncomfortable silence filled the room. Lisbell, still dazed, looked at Ulrich. He continued eating nonchalantly. Noticing her stare, he lazily turned his head, his gaze as sharp as his mother’s, sweeping over Lisbell’s nape.

 

“Hmm… Are you worried my sexual preferences might seem violent?”

 

Muttering to himself, Ulrich gestured to the food on Lisbell’s plate.

 

“Don’t just sit there, eat. Unless you actually want to get pregnant.”

 

The repeated mention of pregnancy startled Lisbell. She flinched at the chilling sensation.

 

“The food is drugged.”

 



 

“I don’t welcome children either.”

 

That was the first bit of reassuring news she’d heard.

 

Finally, Lisbell moved her hands, cutting the meat into small pieces and eating it. The environment and people were far from comfortable, and she could hardly taste the food, but she forced herself to eat, thinking it was a means to avoid pregnancy.

 

Inside, the only sound that occasionally broke the silence was the clinking of dishes.

 

Beside the man leisurely sipping his drink, Lisbell recalled the conversation that had filled this space a little while ago. The sharp, pointed sentences aimed at each other were not something one would expect from a normal relationship.

 

Strictly speaking… it wasn’t something she cared about. No matter what happened to them, it had nothing to do with her. Lisbell just remembered her mother, whom she couldn’t see today despite visiting the hospital.

 

Just as she was not yet acclimated to the vast Laurent mansion, her mother would be utterly bewildered if she regained consciousness.

 

Would the hospital staff explain things properly to her? Or would they neglect her, thinking it was someone else’s problem? If that happened, how confused would her mother be….

 

Once the thought crossed her mind, her worries grew uncontrollably. She kept picturing her mother, sitting pale as a sheet in the pouring rain. Thump Thump Thump… her relentless heartbeat slowing down.

 

Was there no way to help?

 

No matter what she said, the man remained relaxed, as if he was deaf. Even though he acted like a generous person, his demeanor, which seemed to take responsibility for her mother to bind her, was hard to believe.

 

Especially since her mother, just before fainting again, had heard everything about the situation from her. Knowing that they were still relying on Ulrich’s help, despite remembering him, would confuse her mother greatly. Lisbell needed a way to reassure her.

 

“…I just want to ask, just in case.”

 

“Yes?”

 

“Could you deliver a letter to my mother?”

 

“A letter?”

 

“If my mother has regained consciousness, she must be very shocked by the sudden change in her surroundings.”

 

Ah, he let out a short exclamation.

 

As if thinking about something, he tilted his glass, then soon smiled smoothly.

 

“Sure, I’ll deliver it.”

 



 

“It’s not a difficult thing.”

 

Lisbell almost thanked him for a moment. And she was appalled at herself for it.

 

The human heart was so fickle. The one who orchestrated all this misery was Ulrich. There was no doubt about that.

 

Yet she felt gratitude for his trivial kindness of delivering a letter. Her spine tingled unpleasantly.

 

“So, say thank you.”

 

She felt like she was encountering the version of herself he had once manipulated. Though she believed she was struggling to break free from his grip, the unsettling feeling that she was being tamed by him crept in.

 

It was absurd. Lisbell weakly shook her head, suppressing the words that almost slipped out.

 

The urge to speak, buried inside, made her neck itch as if a living creature was wriggling there. If no one was watching, she might have used all ten fingers to tear at her flesh.

 

Realizing she had just finished eating, she gritted her teeth and endured. The dinner setting was as grueling as that.

 



 



 

Wearing only a slip that revealed her body’s curves, Lisbell stared intently at the mantelpiece in her bedroom.

 

This was her current morning routine.

 

Upon waking, she didn’t even think about properly dressing but went to the mantelpiece in a daze. She checked if the letter she had left the previous night was still there. The letter she had painstakingly written in the study vanished every morning. Ulrich, who left early, likely took it.

 

From the day after she cautiously brought up the topic in the dining room, this routine became common.

 

The disappearing letters each day meant that Ulrich was delivering them to her mother. Yet, she didn’t know why she felt a sharp alertness each time she found the empty mantelpiece.

 

It wasn’t a feeling of relief. It was a hard-to-describe sense of foreboding that gnawed at her brain.

 

Considering what she had suffered at the hands of this man, it was only natural that she couldn’t fully accept this seemingly smooth process.

 

But what good was feeling ominous?

 

All she could do was this.

 

Write letters, leave them on the mantelpiece that had become an unspoken agreed spot, and confirm with her own eyes that they were gone.

 

Even if she harbored suspicions, there was nothing she could do. If she unwittingly annoyed Ulrich, the day she could see her mother might be further delayed. Rash actions were forbidden.

 

Regret always hit hard.

 

If only that rainy day, when she considered abandoning her mother and felt like a monster, hadn’t happened.

 

If that incident, which left her with an unshakeable guilt even after coming to the capital, hadn’t occurred….

 

So many thoughts….

 

Was she really like that?

 

So now, was she ruminating over things she couldn’t change?

 

“…Ah.”

 

Suddenly realizing her hand was hovering around her neck out of habit, Lisbell headed to the bathroom before her deepening thoughts could add more fatigue.

 

She approached the wardrobe, holding her dripping wet hair. The wardrobe, once filled with nothing but sensual slips, now held several new blouses and skirts, bought by Ulrich since that day.

 

As if taking a new hobby in dressing her up like a doll, he filled the wardrobe with clothes to his taste. Ulrich’s dressing room was separate from the bedroom, so everything in there was Lisbell’s.

 

Picking the neatest outfit, Lisbell left the bedroom. Writing the daily letter in the study was now part of her morning routine. She moved silently towards the study she had just grown accustomed to.

 



 

Rounding the corner, Lisbell encountered an unexpected scene.

 

A child with a tear-streaked face clung to a pillar, and a red-haired man crouched in front of the child.

 

Neither of them were complete strangers.

 

The child had been seen among the gathered family at Gwen Altahart’s funeral, and the red-haired man, Julian, was the one who stood beside Mrs. Altahart when she accidentally walked into the dining room.

 

Although not well-acquainted, Lisbell couldn’t just walk by. The scene looked as if Julian was bullying the child.

 

The child’s face, pressed against the pillar with evident fear, and Julian’s hand tapping the child’s shoulder, appeared quite menacing.

 

As she hesitated, her eyes met the tearful eyes of the child. The sight reminded her of the orphans at Misley Orphanage, where she spent time with Theodore. The child seemed about their age.

 

“Excuse me.”

 

By the time she realized it, she had already approached them.

 

“What are you doing right now?”

 

Julian turned his head. Seeing Lisbell, his eyes widened in surprise, and he straightened up.

 

“Hello.”

 

He greeted her nonchalantly.

 

Lisbell watched him silently, then glanced at the child. The child, also surprised by her sudden intervention, stared at her with clear, teary eyes. The child’s hair was a bright platinum blonde, just like the hair of the man she had clung to last night.

 

“This child, despite knowing me, tried to pass by without greeting. So, I was teaching manners personally.”

 

“Is that so?”

 

Julian responded with a shrug. Lisbell sighed softly.

 

“I don’t think your intentions were bad. But it could easily be misunderstood.”

 

“Misunderstood?”

 

“It looked like you were bullying this child.”

 



 

“Look at the child’s face.”

 

Pointing at the tear-streaked face, Julian turned his head, embarrassed. Lisbell stepped closer to the pillar, partially shielding the child.

 

“Education is necessary, but I don’t think pushing the child like this is needed.”

 

“Pushing? I think that’s a misunderstanding.”

 

Julian, feeling awkward, rubbed his neck and stepped back.

 

“If someone else sees this, it could complicate things. I’ll leave now. But I want to emphasize that what you saw is a misunderstanding.”

 

“Yes, I hope so too.”

 

Julian turned away with an inscrutable smile. When he kissed the back of the lady’s hand in the dining room, he seemed courteous and sincere, but now, facing him separately, he had the aura of a common thug from the back alleys.

Lisbell stayed in place until he turned the corner and disappeared. Finally, she turned around only after he vanished.

 

The terrified child was still clinging to the pillar. She couldn’t even wipe away the tear pooling in his eyes, as if paralyzed by fear. Feeling sorry for him, Lisbell bent down and sat.

 

“Are you okay?”

 

When she spoke in a small voice, the child jumped as if he had been struck by a spark. Hiccups. Soon after, her shivering turned into hiccups. Despite approaching as gently as possible, even that seemed too much for the child.

 

Lisbell wasn’t unfamiliar with such a sight. When she stayed at the orphanage for volunteer work, a newly admitted child had been in a similar state. The child had come to the orphanage after being intentionally neglected by her mother in the busy streets one morning.

 

At first, the child struggled to adapt to the orphanage but gradually opened up to the kind adults and other orphans in the same situation. Now, she had become so cheerful that she took the lead in organizing games.

 

“Lisbell! Look here.”

 

“Hey, hey, Lisbell. What is a fallen apple?”

 

That child was Mary, the bob-haired orphan who approached her and handed her an apple too beautiful to be called a fallen apple.

 

That child’s actions reminded her of Mary’s early days. With a nostalgic smile, Lisbell reached out her hand to the child. The child, who couldn’t even wipe away his tears, shuddered and fled in the opposite direction.

 

“Hey…!”

 

Lisbell tried to chase after him belatedly, but the child had already run far away. Whatever treatment he had endured, his defense mechanisms were incredibly strong. It made him feel even more out of place in this mansion, which was filled with confidence and arrogance.

 

Lonely and desolate….

 

Lisbell sometimes felt this way because it was like seeing her own shadow—unable to fit in or blend harmoniously, always out of place.

 

Standing alone in the hallway, Lisbell swallowed her breath and headed to the library, her original destination.

 

She wrote and sealed today’s letter. Although that was all she had to do, she didn’t return to her bedroom.

 

She hated her bedroom because it only made her feel her helplessness. The memory of the previous night also left an unpleasant aftertaste. It was a sensation she would never get used to. That’s why she preferred to read in the library rather than her room, even though she could take the book with her.

 

While turning the pages of her book in a corner seat, hoping to avoid anyone, she felt a presence in the once quiet space. She glanced around but saw no one. Instead, a long shadow on the floor indicated the presence of a child, not an adult.

 

Curious, Lisbell put down her book and approached the source. Again, a startled figure darted away. She saw the back of the fleeing figure clearly this time.

 

Had the child returned after running away?

 

She wanted to ask, but the child had long since disappeared.

 

Although a bit concerned, Lisbell didn’t go looking for the child. After all, she wasn’t in a position to prioritize others in this grand mansion, where even taking care of herself was a challenge.

 

She tried to ignore it, but it wasn’t easy.

 



 

As Lisbell headed to the library like any other day, she turned around.

 

A child who had been following her in secret quickly hid behind a pillar.

 

Standing still and waiting, she saw the child’s small head peeking out, driven by curiosity. When their eyes met, the child flinched again but didn’t completely hide this time.

 

Lisbell smiled awkwardly at the child.

 

From that day on, the child followed Lisbell wherever she went.

 

It started with the child revealing their presence as a shadow in the library and gradually progressed to approaching Lisbell visibly. However, the child never came closer than a certain distance, as if drawing an invisible line.

 

Today, Lisbell knelt down, looking into the child’s curious, light brown eyes. As Lisbell lowered herself to the child’s level, the child clung more tightly to the pillar. With a gentle smile, Lisbell gestured for the child to come closer.

 

The child shook her head weakly. When Lisbell mouthed, “Why?” the child hesitated. Lisbell, smiling a bit more, gestured again for the child to come closer. The child slowly stepped out from behind the pillar.

 

Waiting patiently to avoid scaring him, Lisbell watched as the child took small steps forward. Soon, the child was within arm’s reach, though he still avoided eye contact nervously.

 

Lisbell carefully reached out. The child flinched but didn’t run away this time. Lisbell waited until the child’s trembling subsided, then gently patted his hair.

 

“What’s your name?”

 

Lisbell asked softly, but the child bit his lip and shook his head again. Unsure of the meaning, Lisbell tilted her head in confusion. Was the child unable to speak? She wondered.

 

At that moment, footsteps approached from the side.

 

The child, who had just calmed down, was startled like a scared rabbit, shook off Lisbell’s hand, and ran in the opposite direction. Watching the child’s retreating back, Lisbell looked down at her own palm.

 

The child was gone, but the warmth she had felt remained in her hand.

 



 

“Ah…!”

 

Sweat trickled down her upturned chin. Her chest, pressed against the man’s, rubbed against his skin. Ulrich, who had been thrusting into her with relentless force, withdrew at the last moment and rubbed his flesh against her spread thighs.

 

With a heavy breath, Ulrich found Lisbell’s lips and kissed her deeply, intertwining their tongues as he continued to move against her soft thighs. The thick fluid spilled from the tip of his throbbing cock.

 

“Uh…”

 

Lisbell’s platinum hair rustled down. Her slip had long since been discarded, leaving her loosely wrapped in a robe that barely covered her heaving breasts.

 

The sensual waves in the darkness continued as her body writhed. It was impossible to stop, driven by the man’s tongue licking her entrance directly.

 

Ulrich enjoyed the tightness of her trembling walls, reaching deep inside her with his tongue after bringing her to climax.

 

Her soft inner walls squeezed the warm flesh of his tongue, sucking it in hungrily. Every time he swirled his tongue inside her, wet sounds filled the room. He didn’t mind the increasing moisture, swallowing it down his throat.

 

“Ugh… uh.”

 

Lisbell covered her mouth with the back of her hand. Her ragged breaths came out in rapid succession. She didn’t want to react, but her body, already surrendered to pleasure, writhed beneath him in joy.

 

Ulrich, who was fervently licking her below, finally raised his head when his face was drenched. His red tongue slid out of her, gleaming in the dim light, dripping with her fluids, enhancing his provocative image.

 

He licked his lips and inserted two fingers into her mouth.

 

“Ugh…”

 

“You forgot to release your excitement here.”

 



 

“Should I spit?”

 

Lisbell’s face twisted slightly. Reading her discomfort, Ulrich smirked and swirled his fingers inside her mouth, pushing them so deep that she gagged before he pulled them out, now coated in her saliva.

 

Turning on her side, Lisbell blinked at the clock. It was close to two in the morning.

 

A time that no longer felt unexpected.

 

Busy with succession work, Ulrich often returned to the mansion at such late hours and frequently woke Lisbell, already asleep, with his impromptu sexual advances.


When the heavy heat in her belly and the chilling tension in her body woke her up, Ulrich’s weight was pressing down on her again.

 

Ulrich would strip her as he pleased, thrust as he wished, and continue until he was satisfied. As a result, Lisbell felt completely drained. Trapped in this mansion, her only activity was sex with him, and even that left her exhausted for the entire day.

 

There was also a deep sense of self-loathing. Reflecting on her past, she couldn’t shake the feeling of being a tool for a man’s sexual desires.

 

A chilling voice echoed in her mind, urging her not to think further. Lisbell buried her face deeply into the pillow, not wanting to feel more pain.

 

Ulrich, downing a glass of whiskey, removed the blanket as he went to wash up. The sound of running water from the bathroom tempted her to continue her disturbed sleep, but surprisingly, her mind was clear. Only her body felt heavy and sore.

 



 

Lisbell rubbed her cheek against the pillow and brought her clenched hand in front of her eyes.

 

She recalled the platinum hair that had lightly brushed against her hand. Hair that resembled Ulrich’s but left a vastly different impression.

 

As she idly recalled this, Ulrich returned from his shower. Still with work to do, he sat at a desk lit by a lamp, reviewing documents. Listening to the rustling papers, Lisbell cautiously spoke up.

 

“There was a child in the mansion.”

 

Ulrich, who had been turning a page with an unlit cigarette in his mouth, looked at her.

 

“Did you meet them?”

 

Did she meet them? It was hard to say. After she had helped the child in distress, the child had followed her around, but she didn’t feel the need to mention it in detail. Facing Ulrich’s sharp gaze, she felt she shouldn’t.

 

“Where?”

 

“I saw them while passing through the corridor… by chance.”

 

“Did you greet them?”

 

“No. If it’s a sensitive matter, you can pretend you didn’t hear it.”

 

“It’s not that sensitive.”

 

“…Who are they?”

 

“Gwen’s illegitimate child.”

 

She had suspected it. Just by their hair color, she could guess they were related to the family.

 

Also, Julian’s behavior made more sense now. From their previous conversation, she had gathered he was Mrs. Altahart’s lover… or something similar. Was it okay for someone like him to treat a family member so poorly? Perhaps he took advantage of the child’s ambiguous status as an illegitimate child.

 

“Is the child only in this mansion?”

 

“Yes.”

 

“Why?”

 

“I just explained why.”

 



 

“Because they are illegitimate.”

 

“Then what about their education…?”

 

“Well, that’s a matter for the future.”

 

“A matter for the future?”

 

“It means it’s too early to decide their fate. Just because they’re Gwen’s child doesn’t mean they can be formally recognized due to their mother’s poor lineage.”

 

“…Then why bring them here?”

 

“Just in case. Even if they’re only half-related, there might be a need to accept them as a family member depending on the situation. Especially since my mother is very thorough in these matters.”

 



 

“Leaving them out of sight and later having them come back with a claim to the family based on blood relations would be troublesome. It’s better to keep an eye on them from the start.”

 

In other words, because they were an illegitimate child, they were left without proper education. If legitimate heirs couldn’t take their place for some reason, the child would be a backup.

 

Considering the family’s honor and authority, it made sense. However, it was sad and bitter that the child, so small that their head barely reached her waist, lived in this vast mansion without proper care.

 

The child had definitely craved affection. They must have never received such attention, which is why they followed her around so eagerly. The more she thought about it, the more it bothered her.

 

“…I was just wondering, but.”

 

Stop.

 

She had to stop this unnecessary meddling here.

 

What right did she have to take care of someone else in her situation? She had no room for such leisure.

 

But her mouth wouldn’t stop.

 

“Would it be difficult for me to take care of the child?”

 

“Huh?”

 

Lisbell hesitated as she sat up. The warmth she felt from the child kept resurfacing, a feeling she thought she couldn’t experience in Altahart’s mansion.

 

“Even if it’s just basic education….”

 



 

“No matter the reason, leaving a child like that is… too pitiful.”

 

Her heart pounded. Her hands and feet felt cold. Her body, exposed due to the fallen blanket, didn’t cause this chill. It was the anxiety within her.

 

She thought it might be presumptuous. If Ulrich felt the same, it would be disastrous for her.

 

She looked up, tense.

 

Ulrich, staring at her with an unreadable expression, chuckled softly.

 

“You said your dream was to be a teacher… You must really like children, Lisbell.”

 



 

“Or is it a sign that you haven’t given up on your former fiancé?”

 

“Huh?” he tilted his head lazily.

 

Lisbell’s shoulders tensed.

 

The forgetfulness that the dire situation urged always came back because of him. Ulrich would sometimes bring up her past with Theodore. Even though she knew it was just a means to mock her, it was hard to stay indifferent.

 

Because it brought back everything from that day.

 

The misunderstanding that she had an affair with Ulrich, which had hurt Theodore’s feelings deeply.

 

The back of her neck itched again. It felt like dozens of insects were crawling up from her feet, gathering in one spot, twisting her nerves and giving her goosebumps. Feeling her neck growing cold, Lisbell clutched it.

 

Then, he spoke.

 

“It seems difficult. The child is under my mother’s jurisdiction.”

 

“…Can’t you persuade her?”

 

“Your assumption is wrong. I have no intention of persuading my mother in the first place.”

 



 

“No need for such useless efforts.”

 

Despite half expecting this, her heart sank. It felt like a footprint, as if someone had stepped on her heart. Disappointment welled up.

 

Ulrich turned away, as if that was the end of the conversation. While she was left in despair, he continued to review his documents as if nothing had happened.

 

Listening to the sound of pages turning, Lisbell turned her head. On the mantelpiece of Carrara marble was a neatly placed letter. It was the one she had written for the day before she fell asleep.

 

“…Then what about me?”

 

Her voice was dry and rough like a drifting sandstorm.

 

“What am I supposed to do?”

 

She lived each day feeling suffocated by helplessness. She couldn’t even meet her original target, her mother, and all she could do was write a daily letter, uncertain if it would ever be properly delivered.

 

Maybe she saw a reflection of herself in the neglected child. They were both in positions where they had to remain here, even though they were deemed useless for now.

 

That helplessness and loneliness.

 

The pitiful feelings she had to endure repeatedly.

 

“Are you telling me to do nothing? I’m a living person. I have a will and I breathe. So I can’t just do nothing. If that’s what you really want, you should have brought a corpse that can’t move.”

 



 

“Or do you want to make me like that?”

 



 

“Do you really… want me to wither and die?”

 

Ulrich turned to her again. His gaze, deeper than usual, erased his usual relaxed demeanor. Perhaps that’s why it felt so cold. That chilling gaze wandered over Lisbell’s tense face.

 

He clicked his tongue and stood up. His long legs quickly brought him to the bed, where he grabbed Lisbell’s chin and lifted it. She didn’t want to follow his arrogant gesture, but she couldn’t resist his strength.

 

“I find this side of Lisbell very annoying.”

 



 

“But also amusing….”

 



 

“I don’t know whether to find it cute or bothersome.”

 

Her neck itched terribly. Lisbell grabbed his wrist.


However, he couldn’t separate himself from me.

 

My mind went blank at the sight of the man’s gleaming eyes right in front of me. They were terrifying, as if one wrong step could lead to a cliff edge. Eyes that seemed to burrow into my mind and consume my brain whole. Lisbell held her breath in front of those piercing eyes.

 

“I don’t want to make you a corpse just yet, so let’s speak kindly to Mother.”

 

He slowly bent his upper body.

 

His sculpted lips gently brushed against Lisbell’s. Though it was a part of a warm human body, all Lisbell could feel was a cold, bleak chill. Despair and pessimism, which she had often felt, came alive vividly.

 

Not long after, their lips parted with a faint sound.

 

When the distance between them increased, his eyes returned to their previous weight. Ulrich, eyes filled with a rough playfulness, let out a short chuckle and kissed Lisbell’s pale cheek.

 

As he moved away, he muttered softly.

 

“Strangely, it feels like I lost this time.”

 



“Here it is.”

The concise butler bowed and then turned away. Watching the departing figure, Lisbell turned her head.

It was the door to a room she had never visited before.

 

It had been a week since she had reluctantly brought up the topic of the child. Today, she was finally going to meet the child officially. Ulrich had somehow succeeded in persuading his Mother.

 

Lisbell placed her hand on the door.

 

As she stayed still, everything around her became as quiet as a dead mouse. Aside from the departing butler, there were no other signs of life.

 

She sincerely wanted to care for the child.

 

To ignore the child that everyone had abandoned felt like abandoning herself. It was almost like an act of suicide.

 

If she had ignored the uncomfortable feeling that habitually squeezed her chest, her deepening blue depression would have only grown worse.

 

But that wasn’t the only reason.

 

The letter that had mysteriously disappeared from the mantelpiece this morning.

 

Lisbell realized that her range of activities had significantly shrunk since moving to the capital. She met no one, and her daily routine was monotonous. Everything was limited to the point where it could be easily defined.

 

This couldn’t go on.

 

Due to Ulrich’s busy schedule, her meetings with Mother were continuously postponed.

 

But she couldn’t let herself get used to it.

 

However, expanding her range of activities was frightening. She wondered if even this was part of Ulrich’s meticulous plan, given his ability to make her feel the value of her name.

 

He was currently Mother’s guardian, and she didn’t want to arouse any unnecessary suspicion. Offending him would not bring any beneficial results.

 

For now, she needed to go along with the situation.

 

She needed to be careful and expand her range without being noticed. The most plausible way to do that was to teach the child. It provided a reasonable excuse to move around the mansion and potentially gather information related to Mother.

 

Creak.

 

She gently pushed the door open.

 

The bedroom, with its neatly arranged furniture and fixtures, felt bleak despite its tidiness. It felt like a sterile, businesslike environment rather than a space maintained with affection. It was similar in structure to Ulrich’s bedroom, but slightly different in that aspect.

 

As she stepped inside with difficulty.

 

Crash!

 

The child, sitting at the table and having a late meal, dropped the fork. The child, thinking it was a servant, looked up and was visibly surprised to see her.

 

But that wasn’t what caught Lisbell’s attention. The child’s situation of having to eat in such a hidden place was very similar to hers.

 

The stiff child soon came to life. Without thinking about picking up the fork, the child got off the chair and hid behind the bedpost. The cautiousness was consistent.

 

Lisbell didn’t rush the child. She lowered her posture to match the child’s eye level, just as she had done in the hallway. She smiled slightly without taking her eyes off the child. The child, who was awkwardly trying to hide behind the thin post, blinked.

 

Lisbell waved her open hand side to side. At her greeting gesture, the child hesitated but eventually mimicked it. Seeing the small hand, Lisbell smiled even brighter.

 

Seeing the wary expression on the child’s face slightly relax, Lisbell gestured for the child to come closer. The child hesitated, moving tentatively, as if afraid of being watched.

 

Finally, the child was close enough for Lisbell to touch. Slowly, she reached out and patted the side of the child’s head. The child flinched but didn’t pull away.

 

“Hello.”

 



 

“What’s your name?”

 

The child shook their head again.

 

“Don’t want to tell me?”

 

“…No.”

 

“What?”

 

“Don’t… have one.”

 

Don’t have a name?

 

The confusion in her mind quickly turned to cold clarity. This too was a form of neglect. No matter how indifferent they were, how could no one give the child a name? A name was fundamental to a person’s identity. It was chosen with care for the hope that it would play a role in the person’s life.

 

In other words, the people in this mansion didn’t care enough to be inconvenienced by the lack of a name for the child.

 

It wasn’t just a materially different world. This place, at the top of the Altahart pyramid, was a space where even the basic humanity expected in people had dried up.

 

“I’m going to take care of you for a while. We’ll be seeing each other every day.”

 

At the unexpected news, the child’s eyes widened.

 

“But without a name, it will be very inconvenient for us. So… I’ll give you a name. Is that okay?”

 

The child hesitated before nodding cautiously.

 

Lisbell thought for a moment. She remembered the orphanage in Misley where she had once stayed. There had been a child who arrived without a name, much like this child. The headmaster had gone to the church and received several names from the pastor.

 

“How about Noah?”

 

One of the names that had been considered but ultimately not given came to mind. As she gently suggested it, the child’s eyes widened with excitement. The child then jumped into Lisbell’s arms, whispering softly, “I like it.”

 

Lisbell patted the child’s head.

 

The warmth she felt was almost pulsating. It was the first time since coming to this mansion that she forgot the itch in her neck.

 



 

Noah was kind and innocent. It seemed it was the first time he received someone’s attention, and although he often didn’t know how to respond, he showed genuine joy. The pure aspects of a child were incredibly endearing.

 

The lessons always took place in Noah’s bedroom.

 

Although Noah was five, he lacked basic education and knowledge. Currently, he was treated worse than dust in the household due to his illegitimate status, but there might come a time when he would need formal education.

 

If that happened, as a noble of high birth, he would likely be sent to a prestigious public school. While gathering books for teaching, Lisbell learned that Ulrich had also attended such a school, increasing the likelihood of this scenario.

 

The more she thought about it, the more she was appalled by the family’s coldness.

 

If that time came, uneducated Noah would struggle to keep up with the other children, causing him great confusion. Yet, judging by their attitude, the household seemed to expect Noah to endure such difficulties on his own.

 

“It’s too cruel.”

 

In that case, he might have been happier living with the mother he never knew. Lisbell realized that blood ties alone were not enough for happiness.

 

Carrying the materials for the lessons, she headed to Noah’s room.

 

“You’ve decided to take care of that child?”

 

The sudden voice startled her. It came from the top of the stairs she was about to descend.

 

Lisbell gathered the items in her arms and looked up at Julian, who was smiling at her. Since their last meeting, his smile had felt increasingly disconcerting.


“Madame’s consent came as quite a surprise.”

 

Step by step, like an actor continuing a play, Julian descended gracefully and stood in front of Lisbell.

 

“Madame rarely reverses a decision once made. So naturally, I thought convincing the second young master would be impossible.”

 

“…Do you have business with me?”

 

Julian shrugged at Lisbell’s tone, which could be perceived as curt by some.

 

“Business? Nothing grandiose. I just thought we might as well introduce ourselves since we ran into each other. After all, both you and I are the lovers of this household’s members.”

 

Lisbell’s fingers tightened around the book she was holding, turning white.

 

“I am not like that. Don’t compare me to you.”

 

“Really?”

 

Julian tilted his head in apparent surprise.

 

“From what I saw in the dining room before, that didn’t seem to be the case.”

 

He pointed to his neck with a strange smile.

 

“Completely covered in bite marks.”

 

The memory of that day flashed back. It wasn’t the first time she had been pointed out. Madame Altahart had also expressed disapproval with a glance at her neck as she left the dining room. Lisbell instinctively covered her neck, which had healed considerably since that day.

 

“We’ll be seeing each other often. It would be awkward just to nod every time, don’t you think? Knowing each other’s names wouldn’t hurt. So, what’s your name? I’m Julian. Julian Scott.”

 

“…Julian, I’m sorry, but I’m really not like that. I’m just here because of a weakness I couldn’t avoid.”

 

She hadn’t intended to converse with him at length, but the assumption that she was unmistakably Ulrich’s lover made her slightly indignant.

 

No matter how much she thought about it, their situations were clearly different. Just remembering the dining room was enough. She had looked like she was being dragged to the slaughterhouse, while Julian comfortably stayed by Madame’s side, dutifully serving her. Though likely for monetary compensation, Julian seemed to have willingly become her lover.

 

Not being in that position, Lisbell’s rebuttal was clumsy.

 

“Weakness? What weakness?”

 

As soon as she saw Julian’s reaction, Lisbell realized her mistake.

 

She bit her lip. Julian’s smile faded as he saw her obvious discomfort.

 

Soon after, he spoke as if in admiration.

 

“The second young master… caught your weakness? My goodness, the great Ulrich did such a senseless thing? A man even married women lined up to be with?”

 

She felt her stomach twist. Julian’s insinuation that Ulrich’s feelings were special for treating her differently from others made her nauseous.

 

“Is your business done? Then I’ll be going.”

 

“Oh, wait. Hold on.”

 

As she hurried to leave, Julian grabbed her arm. When Lisbell looked at him with displeasure, Julian raised both hands in a gesture of surrender.

 

“At least tell me your name before you go. I told you mine.”

 

Sighing, she realized he wouldn’t let go until she told him her name.

 

“Lisbell Osborne.”

 

“Lisbell, Lisbell Osborne.”

 

Julian repeated her name as if memorizing it, then smiled meaningfully.

 

“If you ever need my help, feel free to ask.”

 

“…You’re quite friendly for someone who’s practically a stranger.”

 

“Living under the same roof, we might have to rely on each other sometimes.”

 

Why should that be necessary?

 

Though she couldn’t agree with his logic, she didn’t argue. The more time she spent there, the stronger her desire to leave became.

 

Lisbell nodded curtly and turned away. Glancing back as she walked down the corridor, she saw Julian still watching her. Ignoring his wave, she turned her face forward.

 

As she headed to Noah’s room, she reflected on her conversation with Julian.

 

“Madame rarely reverses a decision once made. So naturally, I thought convincing the second young master would be impossible.”

 

In fact, Lisbell had also been surprised when she heard Madame had given her permission. It wasn’t beneficial for them in any way.

 

Whether due to harsh reality or cold intentions, it was clear they intended to neglect Noah. Keeping him under the family’s control, either for care or surveillance, and discarding him when he became useless was likely their plan. In that sense, they probably felt fulfilling their duty by just providing for Noah’s basic needs.

 

“Such a useless task.”

 

Even Ulrich had said so himself.

 

So it was puzzling. Why would Madame allow something that wasn’t beneficial to them? And how had Ulrich persuaded her?

 



 

Lisbell paused, looking out at the sunlit window.

 

Is there a reason to dwell on it?

 

Thinking too much would only give her a headache. Adapting to the given situation and finding a way to survive was the best she could do.

 

She was destined to leave this place someday. More interest or curiosity was a luxury. A herbivore wondering about a predator’s thoughts would only end up being devoured.

 

Letting go of her thoughts, Lisbell headed to Noah’s room.

 

Behind her footsteps, the sunlight shimmered indifferently.

 

At the same time, the sunlight pouring into the mansion equally illuminated a hotel in the city center.

 

Rubbing his eyes strained from a long meeting, Ulrich entered the tea room in the hotel lobby, adjusting his cufflinks.

 

“Mother?”

 

“She’s already arrived.”

 

Just as Victor reported, his mother was already in the tea room. However, she wasn’t alone. Ulrich’s steps halted.

 

As if reading his movements, Daphne, sitting next to his mother, turned her head while lifting her teacup. Her golden eyes lit up with delight upon seeing him.

 

“Ulrich, come here.”

 

Damn.

 

Realizing he had been deceived, Ulrich let out a small laugh. He wanted to leave immediately, but there were already eyes on him. Being the owner of this hotel and a man of renowned reputation, it wasn’t unusual for him to draw attention.

 

Unable to turn back, Ulrich eventually sat at their table.

 

“The meeting ran long, so I’m a bit late. If you were alone, I might have apologized, but since you have company, it seems unnecessary.”

 

“An apology would suffice, but why don’t you greet Miss Schwaben first?”

 

At his mother’s prompting, Ulrich finally looked at Daphne. Sitting primly like a noble lady, Daphne met his gaze. Ulrich nodded slightly with a formal smile.

 

“It’s been a while, Ulrich.”

 

“Indeed. I never imagined you would be spending time with my mother.”

 

“Surprised by my unannounced visit? Yesterday, Madame invited me to have tea with her, and I was delighted to come.”

 

“It seems so.”

 

Ulrich’s detached reply came with a polite smile as he ordered a coffee.

 

Something touched the back of his hand resting on the sofa armrest. Looking down, he saw Daphne’s delicate, white fingers. She was holding his hand.

 

“I’m sorry about Gwen.”

 

The intimate touch and sincere expression seemed calculated but quickly felt impulsive. Her touch felt subtly sticky.

 

By noble standards, it wasn’t polite. Touching someone without permission was unacceptable. But Daphne Schwaben was never one to think that deeply.

 

Ulrich smirked, finding her consistent.

 

“Are you sincere?”
