To be honest, Ulrich had assumed that on the day Lisbell signed the contract with him, she would break off her engagement.

 

But she didn’t.

 

Until the day her fiancé visited the Marnia estate, Lisbell continued her hopeless relationship. That was her hope, as Ulrich saw in her beautiful face stained with drunken tears.

 

Even though it seemed she had given up, there was a subtle yet persistent desperation that kept her alive. How could that not pique his interest?

 

That’s why she crossed his mind even more in the capital.

 

People born into wealth, like him, who had never experienced true hardship, didn’t understand such intensity and desperation. For them, boasting and showing off was the sole purpose and pleasure in life.

 

Oddly enough, it was hard to feel any elegance from them. They seemed more vulgar and shameless. He was no exception; the entire Altahart family was like that. Their refined exteriors were just a facade, hiding dens of beasts filled with sordid desires.

 

Elegance.

 

Ironically, Ulrich felt it more in Lisbell, who tried her best in life. How could her earnest desire to live to the fullest not be considered noble?

 

Maybe he felt this way because he lacked it himself. She lived her life more meaningfully than he did, who found life so tedious that he wished to die soon.

 

In another sense, he wanted to delve deeper into her.

 

Why did she strive so hard to endure?

 

Everything ends in death anyway.

 

She would become like dust in the wind, ceasing to exist in this world….

 

Life is fleeting, yet Lisbell seemed to hold onto something that made her refuse to give up. This instinctive curiosity welled up within him, making him reflect on the roots of his own life.

 

He wondered what she would do if he severed all those lights she clung to and if he would feel any different from his current pessimistic self if he, too, found such light.

 

In any case, Lisbell was undoubtedly the greatest stimulant in his life right now.

 

He had planned to return to Marnia as soon as his schedule allowed, but the thought of the delicate scent that clung to him made him want to leave immediately. He wished the ground beneath his feet would change from the paved roads of the capital to Marnia’s lush lawns, not the marble reflecting the chandeliers of a luxury hotel.

 

Walking quickly but still composed, he headed for the quiet rear entrance of the hotel.

 



 

He was straightening his loosened tie when he noticed a sedan parked at the wide staircase below. The familiar face of the man standing courteously before the back seat caught his eye. Upon making eye contact, the man bowed respectfully.

 

“Madam Altahart sent me.”

 

It was his mother’s personal secretary.

 

“Oh dear.”

 

Ulrich muttered. It was a sigh of someone facing the inevitable.

 

He had hoped to leave quietly, but that seemed impossible.

 

Indeed, it was a bit surprising.

 

He hadn’t expected that his mother, let alone his brother Gwen, would attend an event that had already been communicated through Victor. It seemed they had retreated for a quiet meeting later.

 

Ignoring it would be an option, but if a summons from the family followed, it would complicate things. With a sigh, Ulrich obediently got into the back seat the secretary had opened for him.

 

The car glided smoothly along the central road.

 

The scenery of the capital hadn’t changed much. The glittering points of light that could hurt the eyes were still the same. Propping his chin, Ulrich surveyed the landscape before succumbing to fatigue and closing his eyes.

 

Soon, the sedan turned into a townhouse complex.

 

Passing by rows of grand houses, the car entered a massive estate even among the exclusive area.

 

Like an enlarged garden in Marnia, the expansive garden encircled a central fountain. The sedan came to a halt before a mansion boasting classic architectural style and vast grounds.

 

“We’ve arrived.”

 

With the driver’s announcement, the door opened.

 

Stepping out, Ulrich straightened his back, noting the staff lined up on either side, bowing deeply.

 

Despite so many visible heads, it was eerily silent, always a curious phenomenon. As Ulrich leisurely surveyed those waiting in hushed anticipation, he noticed the elderly butler approaching.

 

With a seemingly longer mustache, the butler greeted him courteously.

 

“Young Master, it’s been a while. Have you been well?”

 

“Considering I feel nauseous the moment I step in here, I suppose so.”

 

“That’s fortunate to hear. Madam is waiting for you. Please come in.”

 

Ignoring Ulrich’s sarcastic remark, the butler led the way. Unexpectedly interrupted on his way home, Ulrich checked his pocket watch. Leaving the reception early had given him some extra time.

 

Yet, in this house, you never knew when or where variables would arise. The topic his mother summoned him for would determine the extent of those variables.

 

“Oh my.”

 

As Ulrich entered the living room, a fond sigh greeted him.

 

He looked up to see his mother sitting regally on a single-seat sofa. A red-haired handsome man stood behind her. He was new.

 

“So, my hard-to-see son has finally arrived.”

 

“Glad to confirm I’m alive.”

 

Responding indifferently, Ulrich took a seat on the prepared sofa.

 

As he crossed his legs, a servant approached and listed the available beverages. Ulrich asked for a glass of iced soda. He was in a hurry, so he declined hot tea or coffee.

 

“Really, it’s heartbreaking…. How could you leave without a word? If Victor hadn’t been passing messages, I wouldn’t have known what to do.”

 

Acting as if deeply wounded by her son’s indifferent attitude, Lady Altahart clutched her chest. Ulrich chuckled at the sight.

 

“Your acting has improved.”

 

He leisurely added after quenching his thirst with the quickly served soda.

 

“What play inspired you this time?”

 

Both Ulrich and his brother Gwen knew well—his mother was the most eccentric person in this household.

 

She had a knack for changing faces, not in the surgical sense but in personality, as if another soul temporarily possessed her.

 

She had always loved theater, finding immense joy in observing others’ lives. “Tragedy up close, comedy from afar,” was a phrase she lived by.

 

Her husband’s death had let her whims bloom fully.



The beginning of it all was when the most popular male actor of the theater troupe came to the Altahart estate. At the time, I thought it was just because his charming appearance had caught her eye and she wanted to have some fun for a night.

 

But that wasn’t all.

 

The lady would take them as her lovers and then act as if she were the heroine of the play they starred in. She would fit herself into the role of their partner, living life as if she were that character. It was the essence of vicarious experience.

 

Those related to her realized this when the first male actor was quietly dismissed from his position as her lover, and a second actor was chosen to replace him.

 

When she was with them, her personality subtly changed. Since the heroines in the plays these actors starred in were different, she changed her face accordingly.

 

It was a bizarre act, but with enough money, nothing was impossible. And the lady had more than enough money to keep her secret dream alive.

 

Actors who caught her eye and served her received enormous sponsorship on a monthly basis. Furthermore, just the name Altahart was a powerful enough backing to ensure they wouldn’t be easily dismissed from leading roles. Their treatment within the troupe improved to almost that of the troupe leader.

 

Also, the lady had been a celebrated beauty in society. For a stunning woman like her, just a bit of flattery would make the money flow. It was a position many would volunteer for without hesitation.

 

To Ulrich, it seemed that his mother was currently absorbed in her own performance. The exaggerated act of dabbing at nonexistent tears with her long sleeves was an indication of that.

 

The “current” lover, standing by her side, comforted her, his touch subtly suggestive, befitting his role as a physical consort.

 

“So, what do you want from me?”

 

“Have you eaten?”

 

“Yes.”

 

“That’s a pity. I thought we could have a nice meal together after a long time.”

 

“Do that with my brother.”

 

“That’s difficult, which is why I’m asking you.”

 

Ulrich paused his idle sipping of sparkling water.

 

“What do you mean, difficult?”

 

“Gwen has collapsed.”

 

This was unexpected news.

 

Ulrich set down the glass he had been twirling.

 

“Suddenly?”

 

“Yes, it was a sudden blow.”

 

“Is there a problem?”

 

The lady sighed.

 

Her expression darkened slightly, revealing glimpses of her unmasked face.

 

“Syphilis, they say.”

 

“Syphilis?”

 

Ulrich let out a small laugh.

 

“That’s a sexually transmitted disease, isn’t it?”

 

Given Gwen’s promiscuous nature, it wasn’t entirely surprising.

 

“How is he?”

 

“Not good.”

 

“How bad?”

 

“Very.”

 

“Is he close to death?”

 

“Ulrich.”

 

“Judging by your reluctance to answer, I guess he is.”

 

The lady confirmed with silence.

 

Ulrich, resting his chin on his hand, turned to look out the window.

 

Gwen’s death, huh.

 

It was he who always spoke of suicide, but now it was his brother whose life was in danger. Life was truly unpredictable. Has Gwen written a proper will? If not, perhaps he should subtly intervene now. As he pondered this, his mother spoke again.

 

“So, Ulrich.”

 

“Yes.”

 

“You need to get married.”

 

Ulrich couldn’t believe his ears. The sudden shift in topic left him momentarily stunned.

 

“You know that Gwen is engaged to the young lady of the Schwaben family.”

 



 

“I’ve only informed them of Gwen’s condition, but the Schwaben Marquis seems uneasy. There are reports that he’s been attending social gatherings he rarely went to since the engagement. We need to present an alternative before he gets any strange ideas.”

 

“Is that alternative me?”

 

“Your marriage was bound to proceed once Gwen got married.”

 



 

“With Gwen in this state, you, as the second son, must take over his succession duties. Handling your marriage simultaneously isn’t a bad idea.”

 

“Do you desire the Schwaben family’s gemstone mines that much?”

 

“I can’t deny it. The assessment my appraiser finally completed indicates that the undeveloped mines will bring in a fortune. It would be foolish to miss out on such wealth.”

 



 

“And the Altahart family cannot afford to be foolish. You understand that, don’t you?”

 

Her assertion, reminding him of the scrutiny on their family, was sharp. Feeling a sudden tension in his neck, Ulrich rubbed it and glanced at the ambiguous corner between the ceiling and the wall.

 

“We’ll meet again soon to discuss the details, Ulrich.”

 

Now, he understood what Daphne meant at the hotel reception party.

 

“So, that’s why…”

 

Thinking of her made his head throb more. His past interest in her had faded, leaving only a weary residue.

 

Still, her carefree simplicity, which he had once found endearing, would now become an irritating thorn. Just anticipating the effort of dealing with her was exhausting, indicating that he had no affection left for her.

 

Yes, it was really bothersome.

 

There was someone else Ulrich wanted to observe 24/7, tied up right in front of him. So why this talk of Schwaben?

 

His lips curled with a crooked smile.

 

“What a shame. I’m already married.”

 

“…What?”

 

“And I have children.”

 

“This is nonsense.”

 

“I have three.”

 

“…Ulrich. What are you talking about?”

 

His mother’s stunned expression quickly regained composure.

 

“You’ve been in Marnia for less than a year. How could you have three children in that time?”

 

She saw through his nonsensical statements as a desperate attempt to avoid the arranged marriage.

 

“That’s a bias, Mother. They could be triplets.”

 

“If nothing else, I know my beloved son is speaking nonsense.”

 



 

“Now, stop this protest and come back to the capital.”

 

“To prepare for a marriage, right?”

 

“That’s not all. As I said, you need to take over the succession duties Gwen was supposed to handle, and time is running out.”

 



 

“You went to Marnia because Gwen refused to hand over the department store management rights. That problem is essentially resolved now, so I don’t see why you need to stay there.”

 

Her gaze was sharp like a well-honed blade. Despite appearing as a whimsical lady lost in her role-playing, she was undoubtedly the head of the Altahart family.

 

They didn’t hesitate to suppress emotions for the sake of the family and wealth. While the sadness over Gwen’s critical condition was not insignificant, maintaining the family’s position was more important. They prioritized ensuring that the family machinery continued to run smoothly over the death of a member.

 

Her stern and dry demeanor in using Gwen’s condition to bring Ulrich back to the capital was a testament to this duty.

 

It might seem cold, but that was how the Altahart family had amassed and maintained their wealth for generations.

 

They took what they wanted with relentless determination and discarded what they didn’t need without hesitation.

 

Ulrich, listening to his mother’s complaints, excused himself, using the bathroom as an excuse. Victor was waiting outside. As he walked past, Victor quickly followed.

 

“Should I have the car ready?”

 

“Before that, I should see my dying brother’s face.”

 

Ulrich’s calm tone made Victor look ashamed.

 

“I apologize for not informing you earlier.”

 

“When did you find out?”

 

“Just last week. The lady was very secretive about this.”

 

“Understandably so.”

 

Ulrich didn’t question further and walked quietly.

 

Navigating the long and complicated corridors without getting lost, he eventually stopped in front of a bedroom.



Knock Knock

 

When he knocked, a businesslike voice from inside asked for his identity. Instead of answering, he flung the door open. His mother’s trusted aide looked startled by the rude intrusion but quickly stepped back when he recognized it was Ulrich.

 

With the obstacle gone, Ulrich walked inside.

 



 

Reaching the bed, he crossed his arms and looked down at it askew.

 

On the bed, bathed in the soft afternoon sunlight, lay Gwen, who was said to be at death’s door. Just as the report had said, his once sturdy frame was severely deteriorated. He seemed to have lost a lot of weight, and his complexion was so pale it was unbearable to look at. It was as if he was showing the slow process of how a human being approaches death.

 

“Syphilis, huh?”

 

Of all the diseases, it had to be that one. It was a headache-inducing revelation. Unless even the god he worshipped was fed up with his merry romps and there was no other explanation for such bad luck, it was almost comically fitting for him.

 

In a way, it was a very appropriate end for him.

 

What goes around comes around, after all.

 

All he’d ever done in life was gamble away all his money at the White Club, where he had people preemptively bribe others to rig games, or take various drugs while indulging with prostitutes in his bedroom. Therefore, it was only fitting that his downfall would be so disgraceful.

 

“I wonder if, next time I see you, you’ll be lying in a coffin instead of a bed.”

 



 

“Before that, I must make sure to get your signed resignation from managing the department store.”

 

In their family, the mention of money could wake anyone from their sleep. It wouldn’t be a bad idea to secure everything firmly in case he miraculously returned from the grave. It was a pragmatic conversation to have in front of a dying brother, but there was no other choice. After all, Ulrich himself was also an Altahart.

 

He leaned forward. A long shadow cast over Gwen’s body lying under the blanket.

 

“It might have been your last wish, but you certainly managed to hold me back.”

 



 

“I hadn’t planned to come back to the capital just yet….”

 

Ulrich muttered ominously to his unconscious brother and then sensed someone’s presence, turning his head.

 

The door connecting to a small room inside the bedroom was open. A child was standing behind the door, peeking in.

 

Ulrich immediately recognized the child as his brother’s illegitimate son.

 

As their eyes met, the child’s shoulders shot up in surprise. He was so startled that they didn’t settle back down for a long while.

 

Ulrich straightened up from leaning over Gwen. The shadow that had stretched menacingly over his brother also retreated.

 

The child pursed his lips as if he might burst into tears. Sensing the child’s anxiety, Ulrich uncrossed his arms and walked towards the door.

 

He stopped just a step away from the child and bent his knees to meet the child’s eye level.

 

“Honestly.”

 

Ulrich slowly extended his hand.

 

He gently patted the platinum-blond hair that was so similar to his own and Gwen’s. The child flinched at the sudden touch but gradually relaxed, feeling no threat in the hand’s movement.

 

“You really make things difficult for everyone….”

 

The child’s innocent eyes darted around, unable to find focus. Watching the child’s genuine confusion, Ulrich murmured quietly,

 

“Irresponsible Gwen Altahart.”

 

After patting the child’s head a few more times, Ulrich left the bedroom.

 

Victor, waiting outside, informed him that the car was ready. Ulrich headed straight for the exit. He briefly told a servant following him that he had urgent business and then got into the car, taking out his pocket watch.

 

Even if they drove nonstop from now on, they would only reach Marnia after dark.

 

His fingers tapped the side of the pocket watch as if measuring something. It was a close call. Somehow, the inside of his heart thumped. It had been a while since he felt this kind of thrill.

 

“Victor.”

 

“Yes, sir.”

 

“Find out if there are any long-term hospital rooms available at the Royal Capital Hospital.”

 

“Hospital rooms, sir?”

 

“Yes,” Ulrich replied, turning his gaze out the window.

 

As he looked at his brother lying there, rotting like a corpse, what surprisingly came to his mind was a complete stranger. It was the villa in Marnia where he had spent a few months; someone else was bedridden there in a similar condition to his brother.

 

And he kept thinking of the small nape of someone who stayed by that bed no matter the rain or snow. The nape with hair that used to be well-groomed but now often left unkempt as if they had given up on caring for themselves.

 

“Have you… ever loved anyone?”

 

The violet eyes that looked at him.

 

Ulrich quietly smiled, gazing indifferently out the window.

 

Love.

 

He occasionally saw people in love.

 

Sometimes he heard about it through rumors, and sometimes he witnessed it with his own eyes.

 

Despite their different forms and stories, they all had one fatal commonality.

 

They were all out of their minds.

 

People in love often did crazy things.

 

It was as if that absurdly childish and crude emotion grabbed the person’s brain and shook it wildly.

 

Ulrich hated such things.

 

It was nothing but disgraceful and pathetic.

 

Whenever he saw those who voluntarily jumped into the fire under the guise of such illogical emotions, all he felt was cold contempt that made his entire body freeze.

 

Naturally, acceptance and understanding were out of the question.

 

Above all, that emotion was too fragile.

 

For an Altahart, who had to deal with people all their life, it was an unnecessary attitude and condition. Being in love meant having a weakness. Letting someone else hold your heart was an incredibly dangerous thing.

 

You didn’t have to look far.

 

Just look at Lisbell Osborne.

 

Because she loved her mother and her fiancé, she was constantly pushed around. Her pitiful and wretched state was the result of her love, which she talked about so much.

 

Ulrich had no desire to end up like that.

 

That’s why he openly laughed at Lisbell’s assertion that he had never been in love. There was nothing to offer but a contemptuous smirk to someone who bragged about something he never even wanted.

 

The car’s engine purred softly.

 

Imagining the situation waiting for him in Marnia, Ulrich leaned back comfortably in his seat.



Swish.

 

Lisbell’s gaze, which was fixed on her book, lifted.

 

Perhaps it was just a momentary whim of the weather, but a heavy rain, which hadn’t been predicted earlier, was now pouring down outside the window.

 

She tried to read her book again but soon gave up.

 

The sound of rain invading the bedroom was louder than expected, swallowing up her tiny voice. She could speak a little louder, but at the moment, she didn’t feel the energy for it.

 

She just accepted it.

 

Though she knew getting used to giving up wasn’t beneficial, she was too tired to fight every little thing.

 

It had been like this since Theodore had visited. The small hope she had held onto like grains of sand slipped through her fingers, and she had no will left to grab onto anything again.

 

Since that day, Lisbell had picked up the telephone several times only to put it back down. She kept hesitating, torn between telling Theodore the truth now or fearing it was too late.

 

If she had meant to hold on, she should have followed him that day. Since giving up at that moment, the relationship had irreparably fractured.

 

Even though she desperately wanted to fix it, her current situation made it impossible. It would only lead to the same cruel repetition.

 

So Lisbell let Theodore go little by little.

 

Even if he left, she still had someone left.

 

“Mother.”

 

Lisbell, putting her book down, grasped her mother’s dry hand on the blanket. It still lacked any warmth. As she massaged her mother’s hand, hoping for better blood circulation, her eyes darkened. She thought of the man who had saved her mother’s life but had, in return, thrown her into the mud.


He wasn’t at the villa at the moment. Two days ago, he had to leave for an appointment in the capital. He said it would take about three days, so he would return to Marnia either today or tomorrow.

 

That fact occasionally returned as a bitter reality.

 

The reason was her own appearance, still staying in a corner of this villa even though he was not here.

 

There was nothing physically holding her, but Lisbell was trapped in this villa. An inescapable reality tied her tightly to this place, which felt like a prison.

 

Still, until recently, she seemed to have held onto some faint hope, but now she wasn’t sure.

 

Would the day come when her mother would regain consciousness and open her eyes?

 

Was she clinging to a hope that was too much like ashes?

 

She couldn’t even hold it tight because she was scared, but even if she did, it would eventually shatter. Was she holding onto such a fragile hope?

 



 

It was then.

 

Lisbell’s eyelashes fluttered.

 

“…Mother?”

 

She felt a faint movement in her mother’s fingers, which she had been holding and rubbing for a long time.

 

Was it an illusion?

 

Was it really an illusion?

 

Forgetting even the worn-out hope she had been chewing over, Lisbell stood up suddenly.

 

“Mother… Mother!”

 

Her voice, already delicate and now cracked like parched land from not speaking to anyone for nearly two days since Ulrich left, desperately called out. Responding to her call, her mother’s fingers twitched once more.

 

Lisbell hurriedly looked at her mother’s face. As if nerves that had been asleep for a long time were waking up one by one, strength entered here and there. Soon, her mother’s eyelids gradually lifted. Lisbell, seeing the purple eyes she hadn’t seen since they returned to Marnia, felt a surge of emotion.

 

“Mother, are you coming to your senses?”

 

Having been unconscious for quite a while, her mother couldn’t come to her senses right away. After a long period of numbness, her eyes, which barely regained focus, looked at her daughter who was holding her hand desperately.

 

She opened her dry lips. No sound came out. Perhaps because her vocal cords were strained from not being used for so long, only a dry, raspy sound escaped.

 

“Wait, just a moment. I’ll get you some water.”

 

Lisbell propped her up and quickly grabbed a water glass. After filling it up, she brought it to her mother’s lips and tilted it. Her mother couldn’t swallow well even then. As she coughed, Lisbell wiped the wet corners of her mouth with a handkerchief.

 

“Are you okay?”

 

“Lisbell.”

 

The name her mother managed to call out, after barely stopping her cough, reached her ears.

 

Ah, why does it feel so dreamlike to hear this voice calling me? Lisbell’s eyes filled with tears, unsure whether from longing or relief. As she quietly wiped them away, Mrs. Osborne’s eyes, seemingly becoming clearer in consciousness, looked around.

 

“Where…?”

 

“This is Marnia Villa. The place where you used to work, Mother.”

 

“What on earth… happened?”

 

“Don’t you remember? Mother, you collapsed.”

 

“What?”

 

“Why didn’t you tell me?”

 



 

“Why didn’t you say a word about being unwell…?”

 

Why didn’t you say anything…?

 

Her voice, choked with sobs, was cut off.

 

Mrs. Osborne, sensing how the secret she had desperately wanted to hide had been revealed, let out a small sigh.

 

“It seems I’ve caused you worry.”

 

“They said you collapsed while working. Your condition was so bad that you went straight into surgery.”

 

“Surgery…? I had surgery? Then, how did we manage the cost?”

 

Lisbell smiled bitterly at her mother, who couldn’t help but bring up money even in this situation.

 

“…Mr. Altahart helped us.”

 

“The master did?”

 

“Yes.”

 

“So… that’s why I’m here?”

 

Her mother seemed clueless about everything. It was natural. Although many things had happened to Lisbell, it was all during the time her mother was unconscious. In a way, the foundation of this situation was laid before she collapsed, but Lisbell had kept it a secret, so there was no blame to place on her mother.

 

“The master is….”

 

“He’s not here right now.”

 

“Not here?”

 

“He went to the capital.”

 

“…What is going on…? Anyway, it seems the master took care of me. Did he contact you to come here? And you’ve been by my side since then? What’s the date today? How long have I been unconscious?”

 

Lisbell, calmly tidying up her mother’s wrinkled blanket, spoke.

 

“Summer has just passed.”

 



 

“Autumn will be here soon.”

 

Her mother’s fussy actions suddenly stopped. The mention of the change in seasons carried a clear implication.

 

The one who knew better than anyone that her daughter would be a bride in late summer was Mrs. Osborne. She also knew that her daughter was supposed to leave for another country after the wedding.

 

It was something that should have happened before the end of summer. So the fact that her daughter was still here could only mean one thing.

 

“Lisbell, you…”

 

“I’m breaking off my engagement with Theo.”

 

“…Is it because of me?”

 

“It’s not like that.”

 

Lisbell reached out to calm her mother, who was already sinking into grief. Pulling up the blanket that had slipped down her body, she whispered softly.

 

“It was my decision.”

 

“Lisbell.”

 

“So you don’t need to worry, Mother.”

 



 

“Please lie down, Mother. You just woke up, and if you strain yourself like this….”

 

“Lisbell!”

 

As Lisbell was about to turn away to contact the doctor staying in the annex, her wrist was grabbed.

 

The strength was quite strong for someone who had just woken up. It showed how desperate her mother was.

 

“Tell me honestly. Have I become a burden to you…?”

 

Looking down at her mother’s emaciated hand, Lisbell gently placed it back and covered it with her palm.

 

“It’s okay, Mother.”

 



 

“Really, it’s all okay.”

 

Her voice was hollow. It felt that way because she tried to keep as much emotion out of it as possible.

 

But this was the best. Her mother had been unconscious for a long time and had just opened her eyes. Even though she had recovered enough to communicate after the long rest, she still needed to be careful. And the truths she had to reveal would undoubtedly be too much for her mother.

 

“Sleep a little more, Mother.”

 

Hold on.

 

It’s not the right time yet.

 

So hold on, endure, and persevere, and then, when everything seems back to normal….

 

Lisbell’s hand, pulling up the blanket, hesitated. A sense of despair briefly crossed her mind, wondering if such a day would ever come for her. Mrs. Osborne, who had been silently watching her daughter, caught her hesitation.

 

“The air is a bit chilly. If you feel cold, use this blanket….”

 

“Why….”

 



 

“Why are you so… thin?”

 

Mrs. Osborne’s small question froze Lisbell.

 

“Lisbell, was your wrist always this thin…?”

 

That one sentence was the problem.

 

All the fabricated sentences, busy trying to fill everything with lies, evaporated from her mind. At that moment, hearing those words, she felt as if she was hitting an insurmountable wall. Along with occasional feelings of injustice and futility.

 

Why did she have to swallow everything?

 

If she hid it from Theodore and even from her mother, whom could she confide in about this endlessly turbulent turmoil inside her?

 

Drip Drip

 

Tears suddenly poured out. Lisbell quickly covered her mouth with her hand. She knew she had to stop, but it wasn’t working. Rubbing her tear-filled eyes, she spoke incoherently.

 

“No, this is, this is just….”

 

“Lisbell.”

 

Her mother’s voice, unlike her own tearful one, was firm. She looked up with deeply trembling eyes. Mrs. Osborne, having sensed the discord, silently held Lisbell’s wrist tightly.

 

The strength was stronger than Lisbell had vaguely imagined. It felt like a signal that she wouldn’t collapse even after hearing her confession. Even knowing it was just a fragile mind wanting to depend, Lisbell, as if mesmerized, opened her mouth. It was right to say she couldn’t hold out any longer.

 

“The truth is, actually….

 

Tears rolled down her cheeks and fell onto the bedding covering her mother.

 

She didn’t even know what she was saying. Relying on the hot tears, she poured out the things she hadn’t been able to tell anyone, incoherently.

 

With her head bowed low, she couldn’t see her mother’s expression. She couldn’t bear to look. Even knowing that her mother’s face would be as contorted as her own, she knew it was irrevocable. It wasn’t possible, and she realized she didn’t have enough energy left inside.

 

It was at that point.

 

Without even realizing it, she had collapsed to such a point.

 

After a heavy confession, only the cold air remained in the bedroom. She could easily picture her mother, completely pale from head to toe, after learning the truth. As regret, spreading like a bruise from inside, took over.

 

“Why….”

 

A faint but undeniable warmth touched her cheek. Lisbell flinched and looked up. Her vision, blurred with tears, was cloudy.

 

So she couldn’t see her mother’s expression, but she could sense it.

 

“Why didn’t you say anything?”

 



 

“Why didn’t you tell me….”

 

She finally understood.

 

Her mother’s stubborn refusal to mention her own condition was no different from her own determination to hide every setback she faced.

 

No, it was a mirror image of her own actions.


Lean and frail, Lisbell leaned on those diligent hands trying to wipe away her tears and completed her confession. Her mother, unable to hide her shock, occasionally stiffened her expression and soon after, tears welled up in her own eyes.

 

“Oh my god, the master…”

 

Unable to continue, the lady clutched her chest with a clenched fist, unable to bear it. Lisbell, unable to wipe away her own tears, tried to calm her mother, fearing that even such actions might strain her.

 

“I should have been honest from the start. If I had, things wouldn’t have gotten this bad…”

 

“Lisbell, you don’t need to eat yourself up over it.”

 



 

“I think I understand how we both feel now…”

 

Lisbell’s heart ached. She bit her lip, then nodded carefully.

 

Mrs. Osborne, who was gently stroking her daughter’s pale cheek, looked out the window. Watching the now lighter rain, she suddenly spoke.

 

“Let’s leave together.”

 

“…What?”

 

“I can’t leave you in this place any longer.”

 



 

“Before the master returns… we should quickly gather our things and leave.”

 

Lisbell was taken aback.

 

“But, but mother. I have a contract with him. And mother, you just woke up. Your condition…”

 

“Don’t worry about me. It’s not as bad as you think.”

 

To prove her point, her mother swung her legs out of bed. Lisbell quickly moved to support her. With her help, her mother stood up slowly and took a few steps around the bed.

 

“You said the problem was my surgery and hospital bills. If we break the contract, we’ll just have to repay that money. We’ll leave this place together… and pay it off gradually. That’s what we’ll do. No matter how long it takes, as long as we can repay it, there’s no reason for you to be treated this way.”

 

Lisbell was momentarily stunned. It was something she couldn’t handle alone, something that had always brought her to her knees. Her mother was discussing it so easily.

 

It’s not something that can be handled so easily.

 

Doubt grew from the adversities Lisbell had to face here.

 

But only for a moment.

 

Before her mother regained consciousness, there were many things that gave her psychological pressure. The overwhelming costs and the confession she couldn’t bring herself to make to Theodore.

 

But now her mother had opened her eyes, and now that she had given up her future with Theodore, there was no reason to be held back by that fact.

 

In other words, I am free…

 

“Is it really… okay?”

 



 

“Can I, can I leave this place?”

 

A fine ray of light seeped into Lisbell’s cloudy eyes. Mrs. Osborne gently stroked her daughter’s hair and said.

 

“Of course.”

 



 

“You, Lisbell, you don’t have to be tied to anyone like this. Especially not because of me.”

 

The hope that seemed impossible alone was now overflowing just because her mother had opened her eyes.

 

Having made a decision, her heart grew impatient. Although she had regained consciousness, her mother was still an invalid with limited mobility. To head to the train station with her, they had to hurry.

 

Though unspoken, mother and daughter shared the same thought: this had to be done before Ulrich returned to Marnia.

 

Even if Ulrich escalated the issue to a lawsuit, as long as their intent to repay was communicated, they would manage. First, they had to escape from this place filled with bad memories and psychological pressure to see any sign of a new beginning. Her mother surely thought the same.

 

Lisbell went to her room and opened her suitcase. She packed a few pieces of clothing and some travel money, then grabbed an umbrella from the wardrobe.

 

Fortunately, the rain was light.

 

“Mother, hold onto my arm tightly. If it feels too rushed, let me know immediately.”

 

Lisbell wrapped a cape around her mother’s shoulders to protect her from the cold weather and stepped out.

 

The gate was open, probably for Ulrich’s return today or tomorrow. Lisbell, tightly supporting her mother to prevent her from falling, passed through the gate.

 

It was unbelievable. She never imagined she would leave the villa with her mother so safely.

 

Then, Mrs. Osborne coughed.

 

“Are you okay?”

 

“Don’t worry about me. Let’s go.”

 

Reading Lisbell’s worried gaze, Mrs. Osborne smiled. Even that pale smile was worrisome. They needed to reach the train station quickly to let her rest.

 

Leaving the iron gate, they soon entered a narrow path. Due to the heavy rain, the ground was muddy. Supporting her coughing mother, Lisbell walked along the path heavily scented with rain.

 

After the narrow path, a vast meadow stretched out, with a winding road running through it.

 

On days without rain, she occasionally saw carriages passing by. She hoped they could catch one.

 

As she heard the leaves shuddering from the raindrops, the narrow path came to an end. Lisbell tilted her umbrella back to survey the surroundings.

 

As her view cleared, the weight of her mother leaning on one arm suddenly increased. Lisbell dropped the umbrella and hurriedly caught her mother.

 

“Mother? Mother!”

 

Mrs. Osborne’s complexion was as pale as a sheet, much worse than before. She trembled all over and then coughed with her last strength.

 

Blood spread around her lips. It was hemoptysis. Horrified, Lisbell hurriedly propped her against a tree trunk.

 

“Mother, what’s wrong…! Mother!”

 

The rain pounded painfully in her ears.

 

Lisbell didn’t think of retrieving the fallen umbrella but frantically checked her mother.

 

But the situation didn’t improve.

 

In fact, it only got worse. Her mother, who had been coughing, was now pale and still, her eyes gently closed.

 

Lisbell knew that face well.

 

The face she had seen almost daily in the cozy bedroom of the villa.

 

The face of her mother who hadn’t regained consciousness after surgery.

 

That face now loomed over her mother like a demon. With trembling hands, Lisbell cupped her mother’s cheeks.

 

Mother, mother.

 

Her faint breaths shattered against the falling raindrops.

 

Mother, mother, mother…

 

Lisbell kept calling. Standing before the vast meadow, she felt trapped in a small box, overwhelmed by a sense of claustrophobia. As the waves of anxiety rose, she let her tears flow, lowering her trembling hands.

 

Slowly, she leaned in.

 

She pressed her ear to her mother’s chest, wrapped in the cape.

 

Thump, thump, thump.

 

It was beating.

 

But.

 

Thump… thump… thump…

 

It was slow. It was slowing down. Her mother’s heartbeat was gradually slowing.

 

Was the anxiety chilling her fingertips creating an illusion?

 

She wished it were so, but it seemed highly unlikely. Her mother had stopped coughing altogether.

 

“No, no…”

 

Please, please.

 

Even as she chanted, the beating in her ears grew fainter. Like a dying flame, it seemed inevitable that it would finally go out.

 

Lisbell turned her head blankly in the midst of the relentless downpour.

 

Toward the villa.

 

There was a doctor there. If she carried her mother and ran now, sprinted with all her might, she might save her.

 

But… she couldn’t bring herself to act.

 

Go back?

 

Again?

 

To that villa?

 

No.

 

How could she go back after finally escaping?

 

I don’t want to.

 

What determination had it taken to leave?

 

Never…

 

I don’t want to go back.

 

To that place that sucked the meaning out of everyday life, never…

 

“Ugh…”

 

She felt nauseous. The situation that kept forcing her into such lowly choices made her shudder with all her heart.

 

Even now, with her mother’s heartbeat slowing to a stop in front of her, Lisbell clutched her head. A soundless scream burst from her open lips. It felt like the scene in the drawing room was repeating itself. As if she were trapped in a very bad, helpless prank.

 

The rain poured heavily.

 

Earlier, it seemed bearable, but now it felt like a torrential downpour, crushing her body unbearably. The rain-soaked her hair and seemed to penetrate her brain. Her body grew heavy and wet. The temperature of the rain was as cold as ice. Her body, drenched in it, cooled down.

 

And so did her heart.

 

“…Mother.”

 

No response.

 

“Mother.”

 

No matching gaze.

 

“Mother…”

 

In front of this despicable display, her vile nature.

 

If I give you up, I don’t have to return to that hell, do I…


Tok.

 

A raindrop, precariously hanging on the edge of a leaf, fell onto Lisbell’s head.

 

“…!”

 

At that moment, she experienced a feeling of her heart plummeting to the ground.

 

Startled, she fell backward, landing on her backside. Without even thinking of adjusting her clothes soaked in the muddy puddle, she covered her mouth with her hand.

 

Feeling as if she were seeing a detached soul, an eerie and shivering sensation washed over her, and Lisbell was seized by the impulse to peel off her own skin. A wave of guilt washed over her, gnawing at her like bitter bile.

 

How could this happen?

 

No matter how the situation turned out, how could she even think of abandoning her mother…

 

She felt like a horrible monster.

 

Facing the freedom she wanted to reclaim, she was about to abandon her only blood relative. In other words, she was choosing a cowardly escape over the evident way to save her mother, overwhelmed by extreme selfishness. Even amidst this, she despised herself for only wanting not to return to that villa.

 

Unable to move forward or backward, Lisbell collapsed weakly. In the rain that seemed to wash away her senses and melt her very existence, she was sinking deeper, almost to the point of being buried under the ground.

 

A round violet light gathered above the trees.

 

Through the pouring rain, a car quietly appeared.

 

The source of the violet light near the tree her mother was leaning against was the car’s headlights. The engine sound pierced through the noise of the rainwater and settled.

 

The car stopped in front of the path, and the back door opened.

 

A black umbrella popped up. Unlike herself, who was struggling even to avoid a single drop of rain, the man who got out of the car, Ulrich, had returned to the villa before she could escape and was calmly standing there, avoiding the rain.

 

What she couldn’t even dream of avoiding was something he could handle with a mere gesture.

 

A new awareness struck her as a fresh despair.
